DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Goodstein. I’m Dr. Annesley. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is very nice to meet you as well. Well, it is… a little embarrassing, but I have been having a lot of gas. More than usual, you understand. It is… frequent. And sometimes… loud. It has been going on for a few weeks now, I think. Perhaps a month? I keep very good track of dates, you see.
DOCTOR: Okay, frequent gas for a month or so. That is something we can definitely look into. It's good you've been keeping track of when it started. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. It doesn’t really seem to have a pattern. It happens after I eat, sometimes, but not always. And sometimes it happens when I am just… sitting. It doesn’t hurt, exactly. More… uncomfortable. And the smell… well, it is not pleasant, I assure you. I eat fairly simple foods, mostly. I work at the burger place, so… sometimes I have a little bit of what the customers leave, but only if it looks very good, you understand. I do not like waste.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it's not consistently linked to eating, and it's more uncomfortable than painful. And you mentioned… sampling food from work. Just to clarify, how often would you say that happens, roughly?
PATIENT: Roughly? Let me think… perhaps two or three times a week? Only small portions, Doctor, I assure you. Just a french fry here, a little bit of a burger there. Not a whole meal, never. I am very careful. It is just… good food goes to waste otherwise, you see. And I do not eat anything that looks… unwell. Only the freshest, most appealing pieces. It is a habit from when things were… less plentiful, perhaps. But I assure you, it is not a large amount. Perhaps a few bites total, each time.
DOCTOR: Okay, a few bites a couple of times a week. Thank you for being so specific. That’s helpful. Now, besides the gas, have you noticed any other changes in your digestion?
PATIENT: Changes? Hmm… let me think. I have been… regular, you understand. No problems there. And no stomach pain, like I said. Perhaps… a little bit of bloating sometimes, after I eat. But not always. And it goes away fairly quickly. Nothing too serious, Doctor. Just… the gas is the main problem. It is… socially awkward, you understand. Especially at work.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. Socially awkward is a perfectly valid concern. Okay, so regular bowel movements, no pain, occasional bloating. Have you noticed any changes in what comes out, if you don't mind me asking?
PATIENT: Oh. That is… a bit personal, Doctor. But alright, if you must know… it is normal, I suppose. Not… different than usual. The color is alright, and the consistency is… acceptable. Not too hard, not too soft. Just… normal. I do not have any blood, if that is what you are asking. I pay very close attention to these things, you see. It is important to be aware of one’s body.
DOCTOR: That's very good, Mr. Goodstein. It's always helpful to have that level of detail. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, like irritable bowel syndrome, lactose intolerance, or anything else related to your digestive system?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing like that. I have Medicare, so I have seen doctors regularly, but they have never told me I have anything… special. Just the usual check-ups. Blood pressure is good, cholesterol is… acceptable, I think. I try to stay healthy. I walk to work, you see. It is good exercise. And I do not drink or smoke. Just… this gas. It is a new problem, entirely. Perhaps something I ate?
DOCTOR: Okay, no prior diagnoses. That’s good to know. And you mentioned walking to work, which is excellent. Let's talk about medications. Are you currently taking any prescription or over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing at all. I do not like taking pills, if I can avoid it. I prefer to let my body heal itself, you understand? I take a multivitamin sometimes, but only when I remember. It is not regular. And I do not take anything for the gas, of course. I have not found anything that helps, and I do not want to… interfere with my system. Just… natural, if possible. I do use a little bit of peppermint oil for my headaches sometimes, but that is all. Very occasionally.
DOCTOR: Okay, no regular medications or supplements. And you mentioned peppermint oil for headaches. Now, let’s talk about allergies. Do you have any known allergies to foods, medications, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I do not have any allergies. I have eaten all sorts of things throughout my life, and nothing has ever bothered me. I have never had a rash, or trouble breathing, or anything like that. My mother always said I had a strong stomach. Perhaps that is why this gas is so surprising. It is… out of character, you understand?
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. That's good. Now, I’d like to ask a few questions about your family history. Do any of your close relatives – parents, siblings, children – have any digestive issues, like irritable bowel syndrome, Crohn's disease, or colon cancer?
PATIENT: Hmm… family history. That is a good question. My mother… she had some stomach problems when she was older. But it was never really diagnosed. Just… indigestion, I think. And she was always a bit… nervous, you understand? Perhaps that was the cause. My father… he was very healthy, actually. Never had any problems at all. And I do not have any siblings or children. So… not much family history, really. Mostly just my mother’s vague stomach complaints. Nothing serious, I assure you.
DOCTOR: Okay, mostly your mother's indigestion. Now, let's talk a little bit about your social habits. Do you experience a lot of stress in your life?
PATIENT: Stress? Not particularly, Doctor. I enjoy my work at the burger place. It is… simple, you understand? And the people are nice. I live alone, but I am content. I do not have many… demands on my time. I walk, I read, I keep things tidy. It is a quiet life, but it is a good life. Perhaps… a little bit of worry sometimes, about the world, you see? But nothing overwhelming. I do not consider myself a stressed person, no.
DOCTOR: Okay, a quiet life with limited stress. Now, before we move on, is there anything else you think might be relevant to this issue?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Oh! I did start using a new brand of ketchup at work, about a week ago. The old brand was discontinued, you see? It is… a different color, a little bit sweeter. And I have been using a little bit more of it, perhaps, because it tastes so good. It is… a small thing, but perhaps that could be the cause? I do not know. It is just… the only change I have made recently. A new ketchup. It seems silly, but… perhaps.
DOCTOR: That’s actually a very good observation, Mr. Goodstein. A change in diet, even something seemingly small like ketchup, can definitely cause digestive upset. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. Just to listen to your abdomen and make sure everything sounds normal. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds perfectly alright. I trust your judgment, of course. I am happy to do whatever you think is best. A quick listen sounds… sensible. I am ready when you are. Just… please be gentle, if you do not mind. My stomach is… sensitive, you understand.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Goodstein. I will be as gentle as possible. Please lie down on the table, and I’ll listen to your abdomen with my stethoscope. Okay, I’m listening now… Your abdomen sounds… normal. I don’t hear any unusual noises or blockages. It's not tender to the touch, either. Everything feels relatively normal physically.
PATIENT: Good. That is… reassuring, Doctor. So, it is not anything serious, then? Perhaps just the ketchup, as I suspected? I am relieved to hear it is not something… alarming. I do worry sometimes, you understand. It is just… a habit. A little bit of worry. But I am glad to hear everything feels normal. What do you recommend I do now?
DOCTOR: Based on what you’ve told me, and the physical exam, it does sound like the change in ketchup is the most likely culprit. It's not uncommon for changes in diet to cause gas and bloating. I recommend we try an elimination diet. For the next week, I’d like you to avoid the new ketchup entirely and go back to your old eating habits. If the gas subsides, that will strongly suggest the ketchup is the issue. If the symptoms don't improve after a week, then we might need to consider other possibilities, like a mild food intolerance or a small overgrowth of bacteria in your gut. In that case, we could consider some simple tests, but let's start with the elimination diet first. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds perfectly sensible. An elimination diet is… simple enough. I can certainly avoid the ketchup. It is a little bit disappointing, I must admit. It tastes very good, you see? But my comfort is more important, of course. A week without ketchup… I can manage that. And if it does not help, then we can consider the other possibilities. I trust your judgment entirely. Thank you, Doctor. You have put my mind at ease. Is there anything else I should be doing? Perhaps taking some sort of medication to help with the gas, in the meantime? Or… should I avoid other foods as well?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Goodstein. I'm glad I could help. For now, let’s just focus on eliminating the ketchup. There's no need to take any medication at this point, unless the gas becomes severely uncomfortable. If that happens, an over-the-counter simethicone medication – like Gas-X – can help relieve the bloating. Otherwise, just continue your normal diet and avoid any other potential triggers, like large amounts of sugary foods or carbonated drinks. We’ll check back in with you in a week to see how you’re doing. Do you have any questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I do not think so. You have answered all of my questions, and you have put my mind at ease. I appreciate your patience, and your kindness. It is… a relief to have someone listen to my concerns. Thank you again, Doctor Annesley. I will avoid the ketchup, and I will check back in with you in a week. Have a good day. .
