DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Villarreal. I’m Dr. Korrell. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Ugh, finally. Look, I just… I want to have a baby, okay? And I want it to be easy. My first one… well, it wasn’t. I don’t want a repeat of that mess. I just want to know what I need to do to make sure everything goes smoothly this time. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: Well, “easy” isn't a medical term we often use, Ms. Villarreal, but I understand your concern. You’ve had a difficult pregnancy previously, and you want to optimize your chances for a healthy one this time around. Let’s start with some details. Can you tell me a bit about your previous pregnancy?
PATIENT: Honestly? It was years ago, I barely remember all the specifics. Lots of… morning sickness, I guess. And I was huge. So huge the doctor was worried. And then… complications at the end. It was just… stressful. I don't really want to relive it, if you don't mind. Is there a test or something I can just take to see if I'm likely to have problems again? I don’t have time for a whole life story.
DOCTOR: I understand you’d prefer to skip the details, Ms. Villarreal. However, knowing some of what occurred previously is rather important. “Huge” and “complications” aren't very specific, and those details help us determine the appropriate course of action. But, alright. We can do some preliminary testing. Have you had a recent physical?
PATIENT: A physical? Hmm… not recently. It’s been… a while. Honestly, I mostly just go when something is wrong. Is that bad? I mean, I feel fine now. Mostly. A little tired, maybe, but who isn’t? I have private insurance, so I guess it covers things… does it matter? Just tell me what tests need to be done, and let's get it over with. I have things to do, you know.
DOCTOR: Ms. Villarreal, a baseline physical is always recommended when planning a pregnancy, regardless of insurance. It's not simply about what insurance covers, it's about ensuring you are in optimal health for a successful pregnancy. We need to assess your overall health, check for any underlying conditions, and make sure you don’t have any deficiencies. But, very well. We'll start with a basic blood panel – complete blood count, metabolic panel, thyroid function, and vitamin D levels. We'll also need a urine sample. Do you have any allergies to medications or latex?
PATIENT: Ugh, fine. Whatever. Blood panel, urine… just get it done. Allergies? Let me think… no, I don't think so. I mean, I'm not one of those people with a list a mile long. Maybe a little sensitive to certain perfumes, but that's it. Look, can we just hurry this up? I really don't enjoy being in doctor's offices. And please, no needles if you can avoid it. I hate needles.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Villarreal. No promises about avoiding the needle entirely, but we can certainly try to be as efficient as possible. We'll start with the urine sample. There's a restroom down the hall. Once you've provided that, we'll move on to the blood draw. It will just be a standard arm stick. While you are doing that, I will review your chart and get a preliminary list of questions regarding your family history. Do you know your family's medical history – any significant illnesses like heart disease, diabetes, or genetic conditions?
PATIENT: Family history… Honestly? My family is… complicated. Lots of people, scattered everywhere. I barely knew my parents, and I haven’t seen most of my relatives in years. Heart disease, maybe? Old Auntie Esme had something, I think. But beyond that… I really couldn’t tell you. It’s not something we talked about. Can't we just skip that part? It's going to be a waste of time.
DOCTOR: Ms. Villarreal, family history is… important. While it may seem like a waste of time to you, it can provide valuable clues about potential risks during pregnancy. However, given your circumstances, we can proceed with a limited inquiry. Do you know if anyone in your family has had complications during pregnancy – like pre-eclampsia, gestational diabetes, or recurrent miscarriages?
PATIENT: Look, I’m telling you, no one talked about these things! It was just… not done. I vaguely remember my mother being… sick a lot, when she was pregnant with my brother, but I was a child. I don’t know what kind of sick. And I really don’t want to dredge up old memories. Is there anything we can do without all this questioning? Just give me a pill or something! This is ridiculous. I have a life, you know.
DOCTOR: Ms. Villarreal, I understand your reluctance. However, without a basic understanding of your medical and family history, it's difficult to provide appropriate care. We cannot simply "give you a pill" without assessing your individual needs and potential risks. We will proceed with the blood work and urine sample, as planned. While we are waiting for the results, perhaps you could try to recall anything about your mother’s pregnancy – even vague recollections could be helpful. Do you have any known medical conditions yourself – like high blood pressure, diabetes, or thyroid problems?
PATIENT: Ugh, fine. High blood pressure... sometimes, when I'm stressed. But it goes away. I try to avoid stress, okay? I mostly just take things easy. As for the rest… no, not really. Look, can we just get this over with? I'm starting to feel lightheaded. This whole thing is giving me a headache. Hurry up, please. .
DOCTOR: Ms. Villarreal, feeling lightheaded is concerning. It’s important to rule out any immediate causes. Let’s take your blood pressure now, before we proceed. And I need you to be honest with me – have you been taking any medications, even over-the-counter ones, to manage your stress or blood pressure?
