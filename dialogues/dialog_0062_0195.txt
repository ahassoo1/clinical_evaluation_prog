DOCTOR: Hi Janeth, welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Decosta. It’s nice to meet you. So, to get started, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. Yes, well, it's a bit silly, really. I just... I was hoping you could write me a little card. A “Get Well” card, or something encouraging. My daughter, she says I need to ask a doctor for one, to make it official, you know? It's for my cousin’s husband. He's… going through a bit of a rough patch. Not sick, exactly. Just… down. And a card from a doctor would mean a lot, I think. It just has more weight, doesn't it?
DOCTOR: That's… certainly a unique request! I haven’t had anyone ask for a “get well” card before, but I’m happy to help if I can. It’s very thoughtful of you to want to do something nice for your cousin's husband. Just to be clear, and to make sure I understand correctly, he’s not experiencing any physical symptoms or illness that you're aware of?
PATIENT: No, no symptoms at all! Perfectly healthy, as far as I know. It's more… a spirit thing, you understand? He lost his job a few months back, and he's just been… glum. Won’t leave the house much. My daughter thinks I worry too much, but a little encouragement can't hurt, can it? And honestly, a card from you… well, you're a doctor. People listen to doctors! It's different. He respects people in positions like yours. Not like those… motivational speakers, always going on about positive thinking. Hmph.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. Sometimes a little bit of support, even from an unexpected source, can make a big difference. And you're right, it can carry more weight coming from a healthcare professional. Before I write the card, just to cover all bases, has he expressed any thoughts of harming himself, or feeling hopeless?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no! Absolutely not. He’s a very proud man, my cousin’s husband. A bit stubborn, even. He’d never say anything like that. He just… sits. A lot. Watches television. My aunt worries, of course. She’s always been a worrier. But no, nothing like harming himself. Just… down in the dumps. He used to be so active, always working in the garden, fixing things around the house. Now… nothing. It’s just sad to see, really. He's a good man.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear. It sounds like he's going through a difficult time adjusting to a big change. Job loss can be incredibly tough, even for the most resilient people. Okay, well, I'm happy to write a card for him. Do you have any specific things you’d like me to say?
PATIENT: Oh, that's wonderful, Doctor! Thank you. Hmm… let me think. Yes. Could you maybe say something about… how important it is to remember his skills and talents? He was a very skilled carpenter, you know. Everyone always complimented his work. And perhaps… something about how it's okay to ask for help? He’s too proud for his own good. He thinks needing help is a weakness. And… oh, and maybe just a simple “thinking of you” would be nice. Don't make it too flowery, though. He’s not one for all that sentiment. Just… strong and encouraging. That’s what he needs.
DOCTOR: “Skills and talents – carpenter. Encourage seeking support. Keep it concise and encouraging.” Got it. I can definitely do that. I’ll write something simple, acknowledging his abilities and encouraging him to reach out if he needs anything. Before I finish, are you aware of any history of depression or anxiety in his family?
PATIENT: Oh, now that's a good question. Let me think… My aunt, his wife, she had a bit of a nervous spell once, a long time ago. But it was just for a little while, she mostly kept to herself for a few weeks and then she was fine. And… his brother, I think, went to see someone once, but it was years and years ago. Something about work stress, I believe. Not a full-blown… problem, though. Just a little help to get through a rough patch. They don’t really talk about those things, you understand? It’s not something you advertise. But yes, there's been a little bit, here and there. Nothing serious, though. Really.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for sharing that. It’s helpful to know, even if it was brief. Just one more question, and this is just to be thorough: has he been experiencing any changes in his sleep or appetite recently?
PATIENT: Oh yes, that's right! My daughter asked me about that too. He used to wake up early and get straight to the garden, but now… he sleeps in. A lot. And he doesn't eat much either. Mostly just… biscuits and tea. He used to love a good meal, especially my aunt’s cooking. But now, he just picks at his food. She tries to tempt him, but he just doesn’t have much of an appetite. It’s… worrying, really. It’s not like him at all. He used to be such a robust man!
DOCTOR: Okay. Thank you for telling me all of that, Janeth. It sounds like your cousin's husband is experiencing several changes that could indicate he’s struggling more than he’s letting on. While I’m happy to write the card, and I will certainly do that for you, based on what you’ve told me, I do think it would be a good idea for him to be evaluated by a mental health professional. The changes in sleep and appetite, coupled with the decreased activity and family history, suggest he might be experiencing some depression related to the job loss. It doesn’t mean there’s anything “wrong” with him, but it could be helpful to talk to someone. I can give you a list of resources in the area, if you'd like. And the card, of course. I’ll write something encouraging and supportive. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh… well, that's… a bit much, isn’t it? A professional? He’d never agree to that! He’s a very private man, you see. He wouldn’t want anyone poking around in his head. And frankly, I don’t think he’d even admit there is anything wrong. He just needs a little time, that's all. And maybe a nice card from a doctor. That’s what he needs. I appreciate your concern, Doctor, truly I do. But I think you're making a mountain out of a molehill. He’s just a bit down in the dumps. A card will cheer him up. Just the card, please. That’s all I’m asking. Really. I don't want to involve anyone else. He’d be terribly embarrassed.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Janeth. It’s ultimately his decision, and I respect his privacy. If he’s not open to professional help at this time, I won’t push it. However, I want to be sure you're aware that these changes can sometimes worsen if left unaddressed. If you notice any significant changes in his behavior, or if he expresses any thoughts of harming himself, please don't hesitate to seek help immediately. I’ll write the card now. Is there anything specific about his carpentry work you’d like me to mention?
PATIENT: Oh, yes! He used to make beautiful birdhouses. Intricate little things, all hand-carved. And he built a gazebo for my aunt, years ago. It’s still standing strong, even after all the storms we've had. She loves sitting in it, drinking her tea. And he always said he learned from his father, a master carpenter himself. He’s very proud of his skills. Mention the birdhouses, maybe? And the gazebo. That would mean a lot to him. Thank you, Doctor. You're very kind. I really appreciate you taking the time to listen to me. It’s just… I worry about him. He's a good man. And I just want to see him happy again.
DOCTOR: Here you go. I mentioned the beautiful birdhouses, the sturdy gazebo he built for your aunt, and how proud he is of his carpentry skills, passed down from his father. I hope it brings him a little bit of encouragement. “Thinking of you and admiring your craftsmanship. Remember the strength and skill you’ve always possessed. Wishing you peace and happiness.” I’m glad I could help, Janeth. And please, don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns in the future. Even if it’s just to talk. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: Oh, that's perfect, Doctor! Absolutely perfect. He'll love that. Thank you so much. You’ve really gone above and beyond. No, that’s all, thank you. I think that will be everything. I’m sure this card will do the trick. He’s a good man, and a little encouragement can go a long way. Thank you again, Doctor. You’re a very kind lady. .
DOCTOR: It was my pleasure, Janeth. It sounds like you’re a very caring cousin. Take care, and I wish you and your family all the best. If you do happen to notice any significant changes, please don’t hesitate to reach out. Have a good day.
