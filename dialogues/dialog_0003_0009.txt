DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Alcorta. I’m Dr. Yackey. I see here you’re a new patient. Let’s get right down to it. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Yes, new patient. Alcorta, Delano Alcorta. Well, it’s my sight, really. It’s…diminishing, shall we say. Not a sudden thing, but noticeable. It’s quite inconvenient, I assure you.
DOCTOR: Diminishing…inconvenient. Right. And how long have you noticed this…diminishment?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s…difficult to pinpoint exactly. Perhaps six months? Maybe a bit longer. It’s not something I actively track, you understand. Just…gradually things haven’t been as sharp. I do a fair amount of reading, for personal edification, and it’s become…more of an effort. It's simply not what it once was.
DOCTOR: Six months…vague. Do you experience any pain with this?
PATIENT: Pain? No, Doctor, absolutely not. I’m not one for complaining about aches and pains unless they are…significant. This is simply a reduction in clarity. A fading, if you will. It’s…vexing, more than painful. Honestly, it’s the principle of the thing. A man should be able to rely on his senses.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Aside from the obvious…no. No floaters, no flashes, no…curtains coming down, as I believe the expression goes. Just…less to see. I haven’t bumped into anything yet, if that’s what you’re getting at. Though, one can’t be too careful these days. People simply aren't watching where they're going.
DOCTOR: Hmm. And what about your medical history, Mr. Alcorta?
PATIENT: Medical history...well, nothing of particular interest, I assure you. I've always been a rather robust individual. A touch of high blood pressure a few years back, but managed it with diet and exercise. Nothing chronic, nothing requiring…extensive intervention. Divorced, if that’s relevant. Do you require a list of my ailments from my ex-wife? Because I suspect that could take some time.
DOCTOR: No, that won't be necessary. Any surgeries?
PATIENT: No surgeries, Doctor. Never had the need. I maintain a…vigorous lifestyle, as I mentioned. Avoid unnecessary procedures whenever possible. Frankly, the thought of someone cutting into me…unsettling. Though, my uncle had his knee replaced. A complete disaster, if you ask me. Constant pain. It’s best to avoid them, in my estimation.
DOCTOR: Alright. Family history then. Any instances of…eye problems in your family?
PATIENT: Family history... My mother had cataracts, I believe, in her later years. Nothing dramatic. She lived to be ninety-two, so one can hardly complain. My father…a fairly unremarkable constitution, truthfully. No known visual impairments. Though, my great-aunt Millie…she was a bit eccentric, always squinting. Whether that was a medical issue or simply her personality, I couldn't say. Honestly, tracing these things back…a rather futile exercise, don’t you think?
DOCTOR: And your social history, Mr. Alcorta?
PATIENT: Social history… I assure you, Doctor, I lead a perfectly respectable life. I keep to myself, primarily. Read extensively. Do a bit of gardening. Not much for…social gatherings. Divorced, as previously stated. Is that what you’re inquiring about? A thorough investigation of my personal failings? Because I assure you, there isn't much to report. A quiet existence, mostly.
DOCTOR: Right. Allergies?
PATIENT: Allergies? Dust, I suppose. A mild irritation, nothing debilitating. And ragweed, in the autumn. Causes a bit of…discomfort. But I manage it with over-the-counter remedies. Not a significant impediment to my daily life. Honestly, Doctor, I'm beginning to wonder what relevance all these inquiries are to my diminishing eyesight.
DOCTOR: Medications?
PATIENT: Medications... just a low-dose aspirin, Doctor. For preventative measures, you understand. And occasionally, an antihistamine during ragweed season. Nothing else. I prefer to rely on natural remedies whenever possible. I maintain a rather…disciplined regimen, you see. Avoid pharmaceuticals whenever feasible. It's simply better for one's constitution.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let’s have a look at your eyes, shall we?
PATIENT: Finally. About time. Proceed, Doctor. Though, I must warn you, I have a rather…sensitive constitution. Be gentle, if you would. And do try to explain what you're doing, if it's not too much trouble. A man appreciates transparency, you see.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’m going to shine a light into your eyes to examine the retina and optic nerve. It won’t hurt, but it may be a little uncomfortable if the light is bright. Look straight ahead. Now, focus on a point over my shoulder…Good. And now the left eye. Hmm. Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light. Some mild pallor of the optic disc bilaterally. Reflexes are…slightly diminished. It appears your vision is approximately 20/40 in both eyes. We'll need to check your visual fields.
PATIENT: Twenty-forty? That's…unacceptable. I was closer to twenty-twenty last I checked, I assure you. And "mild pallor"? What precisely does that mean, Doctor? Is that serious? And what are "visual fields"? More tests, I presume? This is becoming rather…extensive. Is there anything concrete you can tell me? Anything about the cause of this…deterioration?
DOCTOR: It indicates some…slight nerve damage, Mr. Alcorta. As for the cause…it could be a number of things. Age, for one. Diet. Lifestyle. We’ll run a few more tests to rule out anything serious. Visual fields testing will assess your peripheral vision. It’s a simple test, just looking at lights in different areas. We’ll also want to check your blood pressure, again. It’s standard procedure, Mr. Alcorta. Don’t worry needlessly. We'll get to the bottom of it. The technician will be in shortly to start the visual fields testing.
PATIENT: "Don't worry needlessly"? Doctor, with all due respect, that’s hardly reassuring. "Slight nerve damage" sounds rather…ominous. And to attribute it to "age"? I maintain a rigorous lifestyle, as I’ve repeatedly stated. I’ve always been meticulous about my health. To suggest this is simply a consequence of growing older is…insulting, frankly. Very well. I shall submit to your tests, but I expect a thorough explanation of the findings. And I trust you won't dismiss my concerns out of hand. Proceed with the technician, then. Though I remain skeptical of the entire exercise. .
