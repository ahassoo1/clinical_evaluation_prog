DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Guerrerolo Lopez. I'm Dr. Versace. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Hmm... what does bring me in? Right. My ears. They feel… full. Like something’s blocking them, you know? It's been bothering me for a bit now. Not sure how long exactly. Things just sound… muffled.
DOCTOR: "A bit now" isn't terribly specific, Mr. Guerrerolo Lopez. Can you give me a rough estimate?
PATIENT: Rough estimate… Honestly? A few weeks, maybe? Or was it months? It all blurs together these days, I’m afraid. It’s not painful, thankfully. Just… annoying. And it's hard to hear people sometimes. Especially my wife… or, well, was my wife. It’s been a while since… never mind. Does the time matter?
DOCTOR: It does matter, yes. Months versus weeks suggests different possibilities. And I appreciate you sharing that detail – stress can certainly exacerbate these types of issues. Let’s focus on the ears for now. Is this fullness in both ears, or just one?
PATIENT: Both, I think. Yes, definitely both. Though… maybe one is a little worse than the other? It's hard to tell, really. They just both feel… blocked. Like when you’re on an airplane, you know? But it hasn’t gone away.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any other symptoms alongside this fullness?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… Let me see… No ringing, I don't think so. No pain, like I said. And no dizziness. I've been a little tired lately, but that's just… getting older, I suppose. And everything’s been a bit… quiet at home, since… well. I’m not sure that counts as a symptom.
DOCTOR: I understand. Let's stick to the physical sensations. Any discharge from either ear?
PATIENT: Discharge? No, no discharge. Definitely not. Clean as a whistle, I'd say. I keep them pretty clean, I do. Always have. Used to get scolded by my mother if they weren't spotless.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's take a look inside your ears, then. This won't take long. Just relax and try to stay still. I'm going to gently insert this instrument to visualize your eardrums.
PATIENT: Oh, right. Okay. Sounds… sensible. Just don't poke too hard, alright? And please be quick, if you wouldn’t mind. I have a bit of… well, things to do.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Guerrerolo Lopez. Left ear… cerumen present, but not obstructing the view of the tympanic membrane. Membrane appears slightly dull, but intact. Right ear… similar. Some cerumen, but tympanic membrane visualized. Also appears slightly dull. Both ears show a bit of wax buildup and the membranes aren't as shiny as they should be. This could be contributing to the muffled sound you're experiencing.
PATIENT: Shiny? Dull membranes… Is that bad? I don’t understand all these medical terms, Doctor. Does it mean I need… surgery? I really don’t want surgery.
DOCTOR: No, Mr. Guerrerolo Lopez, it doesn’t mean you need surgery. “Dull” simply means they’re not reflecting light as brightly as they should. It can indicate fluid buildup, a minor infection, or simply the presence of wax. We’ll start with the simplest explanation – wax impaction. I’m going to order an audiogram – a hearing test – to get a clearer picture of your hearing levels. That will help rule out anything more serious. In the meantime, I can perform a simple wax removal procedure here in the office. Would you be agreeable to that?
PATIENT: Wax removal… yes, that sounds… good. Better than surgery, certainly. And a hearing test… alright, alright. As long as it doesn't take too long. How long will the whole thing take, Doctor?
DOCTOR: The wax removal will be quick, a few minutes at most. The audiogram will take a bit longer, perhaps 30-45 minutes. We'll schedule that for later this week. While you’re waiting, I’ll need a complete list of any medications you're currently taking, including over-the-counter drugs and supplements. And have you had any recent illnesses, even a cold or the flu?
PATIENT: Medications… Oh dear. Let me think. I take… a pill for my blood pressure, something with an “A” in the name, I think. And… vitamins. Yes, a multivitamin. And… I don’t know. My daughter used to handle all of that. Recent illnesses… I had a bit of a cough last winter, I think. Nothing serious. Just a common cold. Honestly, Doctor, my memory isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Alright. We’ll double-check your medication list in your electronic health record. It’s crucial we have an accurate list. As for the cough, we’ll note that as well. Now, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… Hmm. Not that I know of. I used to get hay fever as a child, but that was a long time ago. Nothing serious. No reactions to any pills or anything. My wife… she always asked me that question, but I never had anything to tell her.
DOCTOR: Alright Mr. Guerrerolo Lopez. I see no documented allergies in your chart, which is consistent with what you've told me. We'll proceed with the wax removal now. I'm going to use a small instrument and gentle suction to remove the excess wax. It may feel a little uncomfortable, but it shouldn’t be painful. Let me know if you experience any discomfort during the process.
PATIENT: Okay. A little uncomfortable is… acceptable. As long as it doesn’t hurt. Just get it over with quickly, alright? I have a feeling it's going to be a long day.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Guerrerolo Lopez. Just taking a look… feeling a bit of resistance… applying gentle suction now. Any discomfort?
PATIENT: A little ticklish, maybe? And… a slight pressure. But it’s not painful, Doctor. Just… strange. Do you see anything? Is it working?
DOCTOR: Yes, I'm seeing quite a bit of wax. Good progress. Applying gentle irrigation now to help loosen things up... Still no pain?
PATIENT: No pain, but it feels… wet. And a bit cold. Is it supposed to feel like that? I always hated water in my ears when I was a child. It makes my head feel funny.
DOCTOR: Apologies, Mr. Guerrerolo Lopez. I’ve adjusted the temperature and flow. It should be more comfortable now. It's normal to feel a little wet and cool; it's just saline solution. Now, we're almost there… removing the last bit of cerumen… and there we go. Much better. Tympanic membrane is now visualized clearly. Now, let's do the other ear.
PATIENT: Oh good. Clearer is good. Yes, let’s get it done. The sooner this is finished, the better. Please be careful with the other one, Doctor. I don't want to make things worse.
DOCTOR: Alright Mr. Guerrerolo Lopez, just taking a look... feeling a little resistance here as well... applying gentle suction now. How does that feel?
PATIENT: Similar to the other one. Ticklish, and a little pressure. And cold. It's… tolerable, I suppose. Just hurry it up, alright? I'm getting a bit impatient now.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Guerrerolo Lopez, almost finished now. Just a little bit more… applying gentle irrigation… and there we go. Much better. Tympanic membrane is now visualized clearly. Alright, both ears are clear. Now, let's see if that improves your hearing. I'm going to perform a quick bedside hearing test. Can you tell me if you can hear me when I whisper in each ear?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, let's see. Whispering is good. Anything is better than all that poking around. Go ahead, Doctor. I’m ready.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Guerrerolo Lopez. Close your right ear with your finger… I’m going to whisper a number… ready?
PATIENT: Ready. Go ahead.
DOCTOR: … 7. Can you repeat that?
PATIENT: … 9? No… 5? I'm sorry, Doctor, I didn't catch that. It's still muffled.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, close your left ear with your finger… I’m going to whisper a number… ready?
PATIENT: Ready.
DOCTOR: … 3. Can you repeat that?
PATIENT: … 8? No… 2? I really couldn't make that out, Doctor. It's still very difficult to hear. It didn't seem any clearer after all that.
DOCTOR: Alright Mr. Guerrerolo Lopez. As I suspected, the wax removal has only provided minimal improvement. Given the persistent muffled hearing despite the procedure, and the results of the quick hearing test, I recommend a formal audiogram. This will provide a detailed assessment of your hearing levels and help determine the underlying cause of your hearing loss. I’m also going to schedule you with an ENT specialist – an ear, nose and throat doctor – for a more comprehensive evaluation. They can rule out any other potential issues, such as fluid buildup or nerve damage. Would that be acceptable to you?
PATIENT: An audiogram and a specialist… Oh dear. Well, I suppose it’s better to be safe than sorry. Yes, alright. Do what you think is best, Doctor. Just… please hurry things along. I really don’t want to spend all my time going to doctors.
DOCTOR: Alright Mr. Guerrerolo Lopez. I've scheduled you for an audiogram at the hearing center next Tuesday at 10:00 AM. I've also submitted a referral to Dr. Anya Sharma, a highly-regarded ENT specialist. Her office will contact you to schedule an appointment. In the meantime, I’m going to provide you with a written summary of our consultation, the referral information, and a list of resources for hearing loss support. Here you go. Do you have any questions before we finish?
PATIENT: Tuesday… and Dr. Sharma… Alright. No, I don’t think so. Just… thank you, Doctor. For trying. I appreciate it. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have a lot to think about. And a lot of errands to run.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Guerrerolo Lopez. If any questions arise before your appointments, don't hesitate to contact the clinic. I wish you all the best. And remember to follow up with both Dr. Sharma and the hearing center as soon as possible. Have a good day.
PATIENT: Yes, alright. Thank you again, Doctor. You too. Good day. .
