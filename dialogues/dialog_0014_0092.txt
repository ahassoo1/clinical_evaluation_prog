DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Guilds, good to see you. Though, honestly, they all start to blur together after a while. So, tell me… what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Blur together, huh? Well, someone's getting old. I'm here 'cause I can't...breathe so good. Feels like the air's just...thin. And my mouth, always dry. Like the desert. And my eyes too, scratchy. It's a bother.
DOCTOR: Thin air, dry mouth… scratchy eyes. Right. And how long has this been going on, Mr. Guilds?
PATIENT: Long? Oh, jeez. A while now. Maybe...a few months? Hard to say. Things just...fade, you know? It’s not like it happened all at once. Just...gotten worse, little by little. I used to be able to walk to the store easy. Now...not so much.
DOCTOR: A few months, gradually worsening. Alright. And is this shortness of breath constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Come and go? Hmph. It's mostly when I do somethin'. Walkin', even just gettin' outta the chair. Sittin' still...it's better. Not great, but better. Used to be I could do anything. Now… Don’t get me started.
DOCTOR: So, it's exertion-related. Any chest pain with this shortness of breath, Mr. Guilds?
PATIENT: Chest pain? Not exactly pain. More like…a tightness. Like someone's sittin' on my chest. But not a sharp pain, you understand? It comes and goes with the breathin' problem. Usually when I'm tryin' to catch my breath. It ain’t pleasant, lemme tell ya.
DOCTOR: A tightness… okay. And have you noticed any swelling in your ankles or feet lately?
PATIENT: Swelling? Now that you mention it… maybe a little. I thought it was just the heat. Been awful hot, you know? Everything swells in this heat. Never paid much attention. But yeah, now that you say somethin', they feel kinda puffy. Not terrible, just...not normal.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any history of… heart problems, Mr. Guilds?
PATIENT: Heart problems? What do you think? I’m eighty-three years old! Doc told me somethin’ once, years ago… somethin’ about a little flutter. Didn't seem too worried about it. Took some pills for a bit, then stopped. Never bothered me much after that. Don't remember the details, if that’s what you're askin’. Old docs… always talkin’ in circles.
DOCTOR: A “little flutter,” okay. And what about high blood pressure or diabetes?
PATIENT: High blood pressure… Oh, now that I remember. Doc kept yellin’ at me to watch my salt. And somethin' about sugar? Maybe? I get a little dizzy sometimes. Could be the heat, though. Everything makes me dizzy these days. Honestly, I can't keep track of all that medical mumbo jumbo.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's just get a quick listen to your lungs and heart, okay?
PATIENT: Fine, fine. Get it over with. Just don't poke me too much. And try to be quick about it. I got things to do, you know.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Guilds. Deep breath in… and out. Okay… and again. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally, but there's a mild S1 gallop. A bit of rhonchi in the bases… probably from some congestion. Heart rate's a little fast. Now, let's check those ankles. Yes, there’s some pitting edema bilaterally… about 2+ pitting edema.
PATIENT: Edema? Pitting… what now? You're losin' me again, Doc. Just tell me what's wrong. Is it bad? Is it gonna kill me? Don’t sugarcoat it. I’m an old man, I can handle the truth.
DOCTOR: Mr. Guilds, it's not about “killing you.” But based on what you’ve told me, and what I’m hearing and feeling now… it sounds like you’re developing heart failure. The shortness of breath, the fatigue, the tightness in your chest, the swelling in your ankles… all point in that direction. The S1 gallop I heard supports that, as does the congestion in your lungs. We need to run some tests to confirm this – an EKG, a chest X-ray, and some blood work, including a BNP to check for that congestion. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Heart… failure? Well, that's just great. Everything's failin’ on me these days. Tests, huh? Fine. Do whatever you gotta do. But don’t expect miracles. I’m too old for miracles. And don't give me a bunch of fancy medical talk, just tell me what the results mean. Plain English, understand?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Guilds. I'll order those tests for you right away. The nurse will be in shortly to get some blood and do the EKG. We'll get those results as quickly as possible. In the meantime, I’m going to start you on a low-sodium diet, and I want you to restrict your fluids to about 64 ounces a day. Also, I'm going to prescribe a diuretic to help get rid of some of the fluid buildup. I understand you want things in plain English, and I’ll do my best. We need to rule this out, or if it is heart failure, get it under control. This means…your heart isn't pumping as efficiently as it should, so fluid builds up in your body. The diuretic will help your kidneys get rid of that fluid. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Kidneys? Look, Doc, I came in here 'cause I can't breathe, not to learn about my kidneys. Fluid… in my body? Sounds awful. All this… pills, diets, tests… it's a bother. Just… try to fix my breathin', okay? That’s all I care about. The rest of it… it can wait.
DOCTOR: Mr. Guilds, I am trying to fix your breathing. But we need to understand why you can't breathe. And the diuretics will help with that, by removing the excess fluid from your lungs. This isn’t just about the pills or the diet, it's about helping your heart work better. We will get those tests done, and then we'll talk about a plan. I understand you're frustrated, but this is important. I'm going to write you a prescription for Furosemide 20mg once daily, and the nurse will go over the side effects with you. I want you to weigh yourself every day, first thing in the morning, and let me know if you gain more than two pounds in a day. That could be a sign that the fluid is building up too quickly. The nurse will be in shortly to take your blood pressure, and I will let her know about this heart failure suspicion. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Furosemide… Sounds like somethin’ you spray on weeds. Fine, fine. Do what you gotta do. Weigh myself…every day. Two pounds… okay, I’ll try to remember. But don’t expect me to be perfect. Old man, remember? Just get the nurse in here already. This is takin' too long.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Guilds. I'll have the nurse come in right away. Remember, if your shortness of breath gets worse at any time before your next appointment, or if you experience any chest pain, go to the emergency room immediately. And please try to follow the instructions as best you can. It's for your own good. I'll see you back here in a few days to discuss the test results. .
