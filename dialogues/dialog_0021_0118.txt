DOCTOR: Right. Mr. Oriley, is it?
PATIENT: Yes, that is correct. Though, I confess, I don't recall making an appointment. Is something… amiss? It’s rather drafty in here, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: Honestly, people forget all the time. It’s the nature of things. Though, I do wish they'd tell the front desk. Now, let’s not get sidetracked by the temperature. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, I believe… a certification of some sort? Something to do with my… profession. It’s all rather vague, I’m afraid. I’ve been quite busy, you understand. One doesn't have time to remember every little detail when one is… dedicated. Is that what this is about? A check-up for work purposes?
DOCTOR: A work check-up… possibly. Though usually, someone would know if they were sent for one. And frankly, the paperwork usually specifies what for. Let’s start with the basics. Do you have any specific complaints?
PATIENT: Complaints? Not particularly. Though my ears have been… ringing, occasionally. It’s a very subtle thing, easily dismissed. And my vision… well, I suppose it isn’t as sharp as it once was. But that’s to be expected at my age, isn’t it? One can’t expect to remain youthful forever. It’s all rather… natural. Is ringing a concern? I hadn’t considered it worthy of a doctor’s time, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Ringing in the ears… tinnitus. It can be a sign of something, yes. And vision changes, even expected ones, should be checked. Alright. Let's do a quick run-through. Any pain anywhere?
PATIENT: Pain? No, not precisely. A little stiffness in the joints some mornings, perhaps. But that’s just… getting old. It’s hardly a cause for alarm, is it? My ex-wife always complained about my aches and pains. Said I was too stoic. Women. Always fussing over something. Is this relevant to my… hearing, do you think? It feels rather disconnected, all these questions.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, it’s my job to ask. Joint stiffness... how long has that been going on?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Years, I should imagine. Decades, even. It comes and goes, you understand. I don’t keep a precise log of my ailments. Really, I’m here for… whatever certification I require. Is that not what we were discussing? My profession demands a certain level of… physical competence, and I suppose they want confirmation of that. Though, honestly, I find the whole process rather demeaning. A perfectly capable man subjected to a battery of tests… it’s preposterous.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. Let's try this a different way. Any major illnesses in the past?
PATIENT: Major illnesses… Hmm. Now that is a question. I had the usual childhood things, I suppose. Measles, mumps… nothing serious. And… there was that bout of influenza, back in '87, I believe. Quite debilitating, that was. Laid me up for a week. Beyond that… no, I can't recall anything of particular significance. I’ve always been rather… robust, you see. A strong constitution. Is that helpful? Or are we simply cataloging every sniffle and sneeze from my past?
DOCTOR: And have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… Let me see. There was my appendix, of course, when I was quite young. A rather standard procedure, I believe. And… ah, yes. A minor operation on my knee, years ago. Sports injury. Nothing significant. I was quite the athlete in my youth, you know. A rather… unfortunate incident involving a football and a rather aggressive opponent. Is this all terribly important? I’m beginning to suspect this isn’t simply a certification, after all. Are you perhaps evaluating my overall health? Because I assure you, I am perfectly… serviceable.
DOCTOR: Serviceable. Right. Family history, then. Any heart disease, diabetes, cancer… in your parents, siblings?
PATIENT: Family history… Now that’s a difficult question. My father… he was a strong man, a fisherman. Lived a long life, though I believe he had some… stomach trouble in his later years. My mother… she was a homemaker. I don’t recall any particular illnesses afflicting her. A sister, yes, but we weren’t close. She married an accountant and moved to… America, I think. I have no idea what became of her. Honestly, these genealogical inquiries are rather… intrusive. I fail to see how my distant relatives’ health concerns are relevant to my… certification. Are you quite finished with the personal questions? I'm beginning to feel like a specimen under a microscope.
DOCTOR: Alright. Social history. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: Smoke? Heavens, no. Absolutely not. A barbaric habit. I’ve always prided myself on a clean lifestyle. A glass of sherry with dinner, perhaps, but smoking? Never. My father always said it was… detrimental to one’s constitution. A waste of good money, as well. Is that to your satisfaction? I trust we are nearing the end of this… interrogation? I do have other engagements, you understand. Important engagements. Though I can’t quite recall what they are at the moment. Perhaps something to do with… paperwork. Yes, paperwork. It’s always paperwork.
DOCTOR: Alright. Any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies… Now that's a tricky one. I don’t recall any… severe reactions. A slight rash once, after taking some… pink pill. But that could have been anything. My ex-wife was always experimenting with different remedies. Homeopathic concoctions, mostly. Utter nonsense, if you ask me. I’m generally quite resilient. I don’t bother with medications unless absolutely necessary. Is this really important? I’m starting to suspect you are fishing for information, and I must confess, I find it rather… disrespectful. I am a professional, you know. A highly trained… individual. And I resent being treated like a… hypochondriac.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, let’s get a quick physical exam done. Just to be thorough. Can you stand for me?
PATIENT: A physical exam? Now that’s excessive. I assure you, I am in perfectly good health. I’ve already told you that. I’m a professional, remember? I require a certification, not a… dismantling. I’m perfectly capable of standing, of course, but I fail to see the necessity. Is this standard procedure? Because frankly, I find it rather… undignified. And frankly, I was promised a simple process. Are you certain you have the correct paperwork? I'm beginning to suspect a grave misunderstanding. I'd like to speak to someone in charge.
DOCTOR: Mr. Oriley, with all due respect, I am in charge. And I need to perform a basic assessment to determine your…fitness. It’s not a dismantling. It's a check of your reflexes, blood pressure, listening to your heart and lungs, looking in your ears, that sort of thing. Just stand here, please. It will take five minutes. If you refuse, I cannot provide you with any…documentation.
PATIENT: Very well. But I must protest this… indignity. It’s a complete waste of my time, and frankly, it’s rather…degrading. But I suppose I have no choice. Though I expect a full explanation afterward. And I insist on a copy of all your findings. In writing. I am a professional, remember? I have rights. Now, proceed. But be gentle. My joints aren’t what they used to be. And do try not to poke me with anything sharp. I have a rather low tolerance for… discomfort.
DOCTOR: Alright. Blood pressure is… 145 over 90. A little elevated. Heart sounds…regular, but slightly muffled. Lungs are clear, but breathing is a bit shallow. Now, let's check your reflexes.
PATIENT: Elevated? Nonsense. I walk briskly every morning. Well, when the weather permits. And briskly is relative, of course. As for my heart…muffled? I assure you, it beats strongly. It must be the acoustics in here. It’s a rather…clinical environment, isn’t it? And my breathing…well, I was just thinking about the paperwork, naturally. It’s a stressful situation, this whole ordeal. It’s enough to make anyone…short of breath. Are you certain your equipment is functioning correctly? Perhaps it requires calibration. And please, do try to be a little more…delicate. I’m a sensitive man, you know. A highly trained… professional.
DOCTOR: Patellar reflexes… 2+ bilaterally. Normal. Now, let’s look in your ears. Hmm. There’s some cerumen buildup in both ears. And… slight redness. Do you experience any pain or drainage?
PATIENT: Cerumen? Is that…wax? I assure you, I maintain impeccable hygiene. Though I haven't actively…cleaned my ears recently. It's not something one prioritizes, is it? And redness? Perhaps it’s the draft in here, as I mentioned earlier. It’s a rather…chilly environment. And pain? A slight…discomfort, perhaps. A tingling sensation. But nothing serious. I’m a very stoic man, you know. A professional. I don’t complain easily. Is this wax…significant? Will it affect my certification? I insist on a full explanation. And perhaps a warm compress? My ears are feeling rather…sensitive. This is all very unsettling. I’m beginning to suspect incompetence. Or a conspiracy.
DOCTOR: Alright. The cerumen buildup could be contributing to the tinnitus, and the redness suggests some mild inflammation. It’s likely just a minor ear infection. I recommend a course of ear drops. But before that, let’s check your vision. Can you read this chart for me?
PATIENT: Vision? Oh, goodness. Not again. I assure you, my vision is perfectly adequate. I read the newspaper every morning. Well, when I can find it. And I've never had any trouble driving. Though I prefer to take taxis these days. It’s less stressful, you understand. And an ear infection? Nonsense. I haven't been feeling ill. Perhaps it's the fluorescent lights. They’re terribly harsh, you know. And I detest hospitals. The smell… the sterility… it’s all very…depressing. But very well. Let’s get this over with. Though I insist on a second opinion. And a full refund if my vision is perfectly acceptable. This is becoming quite the ordeal. I demand satisfaction. Now, point to the smallest letter you can see. But be gentle, please. My eyes are feeling rather…sensitive.
DOCTOR: Right. You read… 20/40. That's not ideal. It suggests some mild vision impairment. It's likely age-related, but it could also be related to… other factors. We should consider a referral to an ophthalmologist. So, to summarize… Elevated blood pressure, some mild tinnitus, cerumen buildup in both ears, and mild vision impairment. I also noted a slight shuffling gait when you walked. It’s likely nothing serious, but it warrants further investigation.
PATIENT: A shuffling gait? Preposterous! I walk with dignity and purpose! Purpose, I tell you! And a vision impairment? I assure you, my vision is perfectly acceptable for…my profession! This is an outrage! You’re attempting to discredit me! This is all…a conspiracy! I demand to see the video footage! And a second opinion! From a reputable doctor! Not…this! This is unacceptable! I came here for a simple certification, and I’m leaving with a diagnosis of… infirmity! I will not stand for it! I demand a full refund! And an apology! And a complimentary taxi ride home! This is…this is…a travesty! I’m a highly trained… professional! And I deserve respect! I insist on speaking to your supervisor! This is…this is….
DOCTOR: Mr. Oriley, I understand your frustration. However, I am providing you with an honest assessment of your health. I recommend you follow up with an ophthalmologist and a cardiologist, and we can discuss managing your blood pressure. I'm happy to provide you with referrals, and a list of potential specialists. Unfortunately, I will not be providing a refund. You requested an examination, and that's what I've provided. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
