DOCTOR: Alright, Mrs. Genard, have a seat. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Huh? Oh. Yeah, okay. It's… down there. Something’s coming out. Not good, you know? Not normal. It’s… wet. And…icky.
DOCTOR: “Down there,” alright. And how long has this “something” been coming out, Mrs. Genard?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. A while now. Maybe… a week? More? I don't really keep track of these things. It just…started. And it bothers me. It smells funny too. Not like flowers, that's for sure. Men shouldn't have these problems, honestly.
DOCTOR: Right. A week or more. And you said it's…wet and has an odor. Okay. Just to clarify, Mrs. Genard, you're a man, and you're experiencing discharge?
PATIENT: What? No! I'm a woman! Jimmi Genard! Have you not been listening? I told you that already. Honestly, some people... It's coming from a man, my son! My son has the problem. He sent me here, he's too embarrassed to come himself. He's a grown man, should be able to handle it, but… well, boys.
DOCTOR: Mrs. Genard, my apologies. I seem to have gotten my notes mixed up. So, you are here today because your son is experiencing a discharge?
PATIENT: Yes! Finally! See? That's what I've been trying to tell you. He's a good boy, really. Works hard. Doesn’t deserve this. He's a bit… careless, sometimes. But a good boy. And he's embarrassed, that's the main thing. Doesn't want anyone to know. Especially his friends.
DOCTOR: Alright. And can you describe the discharge a little more?
PATIENT: Hmm… how to explain… It’s… kinda yellowish. And thick. Not like water, more like… custard. But not sweet! Definitely not sweet. And it has a smell. A bad smell. Like old fish, maybe? Or… dirty socks. I don't know, it’s just nasty. He tries to keep it clean, but… you know how boys are.
DOCTOR: And has your son experienced any pain, burning, or itching along with this discharge?
PATIENT: Pain? Hmmm… He hasn’t said anything. He's a quiet boy. Doesn't complain much. But… now that you mention it, he's been a little more… grumpy lately. And he's been going to the bathroom a lot more. Just…peeing a lot. Could be that. He mostly just keeps to himself. Hard to tell if anything's really bothering him. Boys. They never say anything.
DOCTOR: Okay. And has he had any fever, chills, or abdominal pain?
PATIENT: Fever? No, not that I know of. He’s been working a lot of overtime at the store. Always tired, but that's just… work. He doesn't get sick easily, my son. Strong boy. Abdominal pain… no. He eats okay. Too many sweets, maybe. But no pain. He did get a little sunburned last weekend. Does that count?
DOCTOR: No, a sunburn wouldn't be directly related, Mrs. Genard. Now, has your son had any previous sexually transmitted infections or any similar symptoms in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Now you're asking personal things! Honestly, I don't ask about his… private life. He's a grown man. And I certainly don't know about any… infections. That's between him and… whoever. He's a good boy! He wouldn't get into trouble like that. I raised him better. That's a rude question, you know. Very rude.
DOCTOR: Alright. Very well. Given the symptoms you’ve described - the yellowish, thick discharge, increased urinary frequency, and possible irritability - the most likely possibility is a sexually transmitted infection, specifically gonorrhea or chlamydia. However, we can’t be certain without testing. I need to collect a urine sample from your son to send to the lab. It’s the only way to get a definitive diagnosis. It’s important to get this checked out, even if he’s embarrassed. Untreated infections can lead to serious complications.
PATIENT: Infections?! Oh, dear. That sounds… awful. Serious complications? What kind of complications? Will he be… sick forever? He needs his job! And what if other people… catch it? A urine sample… well, I suppose that's alright. But… how do we do that? I can't just… ask him to pee in a jar! He'll be mortified. This is a disaster. A complete disaster.
DOCTOR: Mrs. Genard, I understand your concern. It's certainly not ideal, but it's a simple procedure. We can provide a sterile container and instructions. He'll need to collect a "midstream" sample—that means he starts urinating, then collects the sample mid-stream into the container. We have privacy in the bathroom, and I can explain the process to him directly if you prefer. As for complications, untreated infections can lead to pain, inflammation, and even infertility. However, these infections are easily treated with antibiotics if caught early. The most important thing is to get him tested and treated if necessary. We can discuss this further once we have the results. Would you like me to explain the collection process to him directly, or would you prefer to do so?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Infertility?! He wants a family! He's always talking about babies... No, no, this is terrible. I can’t… I can't ask him. I just can't. It’s too embarrassing. And he'll think I don't trust him! You… you explain it. Yes, you explain it to him. Just… be gentle. And don't say anything about… infertility. Or… infections. Just say it's a routine check-up. And can you promise me he won’t have to tell anyone? This has to stay private. Very, very private.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mrs. Genard. I can explain the process to him directly and will be discreet and sensitive. I will not mention infertility or infection specifically. I understand your concern about confidentiality, and I assure you this will remain private. I will need him to provide a urine sample today. Once we have the results, we can discuss the best course of action. In the meantime, it's important to avoid any sexual activity until we know what we're dealing with. Do you have any further questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No… no, I think that’s everything. Just… please be kind to him. He’s a good boy, really. He just… doesn't like these things. And thank you… for being so understanding. I was so worried. I just want him to be okay. He deserves to be happy. Do you think… do you think everything will be alright?
DOCTOR: Mrs. Genard, I understand your worry. It's natural to be concerned about your son. While I can't guarantee anything until we have the lab results, these infections are often easily treated, especially when caught early. I will do my best to make him feel comfortable and explain everything clearly. We'll take things one step at a time. If you'd like, you can wait in the waiting room while I speak with him. Or, if you prefer, I can call you with the results as soon as they're available. For now, let’s focus on getting him tested. We’ll deal with whatever comes next together. Would you like me to call him in now?
PATIENT: Yes… yes, please. Call him in. And… thank you again. You've been very helpful. Tell him… tell him I said to be a good boy. .
DOCTOR: Alright. I will. .
