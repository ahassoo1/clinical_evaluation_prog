DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Slavern. I am Dr. Blim. Now, let’s get straight to it. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Well, it's my blood pressure, really. It's been a bit high lately, and my sister, she kept on at me to get it checked. She worries, that one.
DOCTOR: “A bit high,” you say. That’s not terribly specific, Ms. Slavern. Can you give me some numbers, if you have them?
PATIENT: Numbers… hmm. Not really, no. I don't own a machine or anything. The pharmacy checked it when I picked up my meds last month, and the lady said it was a little over, but I didn’t really write it down. I just know she looked a bit concerned. Does that make sense? I’m not good with remembering things like that.
DOCTOR: It’s…unfortunate you don’t have readings. Relying on vague recollections isn’t ideal, Ms. Slavern. However. Let's proceed. Do you experience any symptoms with this elevated blood pressure?
PATIENT: Symptoms… not really. Not that I’ve noticed, anyway. I mean, sometimes I get a little headache, but everyone gets headaches, right? And maybe I feel a bit tired, but I work long hours, so… I thought it was just that. I don't get nosebleeds or blurry vision or anything dramatic like that.
DOCTOR: Headaches and fatigue are exceedingly common, Ms. Slavern. Not particularly indicative of anything serious. Now, tell me about these “long hours.” What exactly do you do for work?
PATIENT: Well, I do a bit of everything, really. I help folks out with personal care – cleaning, cooking, errands… mostly for older people who need a hand. I’m not on a schedule, so it can be pretty unpredictable, and some days are just… longer than others. I try to keep up, but it's a lot sometimes. I'm a bit of a jack-of-all-trades, I suppose.
DOCTOR: So, a rather…varied workload. Do you find this work particularly stressful, Ms. Slavern?
PATIENT: Stressful? Hmm. Sometimes, yeah, I guess it can be. Dealing with people, you know? Everyone's got their own story and their own needs. And sometimes it's just…a lot of physical work. Lifting, bending, being on my feet all day. But I like helping people, so it mostly balances out. It’s better than sitting around doing nothing, that’s for sure.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let’s move on to your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any chronic conditions – diabetes, heart disease, kidney problems – anything at all?
PATIENT: Not that I know of, Doctor. I’ve never really been sick, you know? I had the usual childhood stuff – chickenpox, measles – but nothing serious. I had my gallbladder out maybe ten years ago, but that's it. And I have arthritis in my hands, but it’s not too bad. Just a little stiff sometimes. I’ve been to the doctor for check-ups now and then, but they always said I was pretty healthy.
DOCTOR: Arthritis, you say?
PATIENT: Yeah, just in my fingers mostly. It flares up sometimes, especially when it’s cold. I use some cream, and it helps a bit. It’s not crippling or anything. I can still do my work, thankfully. I don’t want to complain too much, you know? Lots of people have worse.
DOCTOR: Quite. Now, are you currently taking any medications, prescription or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: Just the arthritis cream, like I said. And sometimes I take something for headaches, if they’re really bad. Just regular ibuprofen, the kind you can buy at the drugstore. Nothing else. I try to avoid taking pills if I can. I don’t really trust them, if you know what I mean.
DOCTOR: I see. And do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope, not that I'm aware of. I eat everything. My sister always teases me about it. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. No hives, no trouble breathing… nothing like that. I think I'd remember something like that, wouldn’t I?
DOCTOR: One would hope. Very well. Let's proceed with a brief physical examination. Please step onto the scale, Ms. Slavern. I need to verify your weight.
PATIENT: Okay, sure. Hope I haven’t put on too much weight! It's hard to eat healthy with the way my schedule is, you know?
DOCTOR: One hundred and thirty-two pounds. And your height is listed as five feet, seven inches. That gives you a BMI of twenty-six point seven. Now, let's take your blood pressure and listen to your heart and lungs. Please have a seat on the examination table.
PATIENT: Okay. Is that a little high? Twenty-six point seven? I don't really understand those numbers. Is that bad?
DOCTOR: It's not ideal, Ms. Slavern. But let's not dwell on that now. Let’s get a current blood pressure reading. Just relax your arm. One hundred and forty-eight over ninety-two. That is, unfortunately, elevated. Your heart rate is seventy-eight, regular. Lung sounds are clear bilaterally. No murmurs or rubs auscultated. We'll need to investigate this further.
PATIENT: Oh dear. That does sound bad, doesn’t it? What does that mean, “investigate”? Am I going to have to have tests? I don’t really like going to hospitals or anything.
DOCTOR: It means we need more information, Ms. Slavern. A single reading is never definitive. We will need to repeat the blood pressure measurement on multiple occasions to confirm this elevation. I also recommend a basic blood panel to assess your kidney function and rule out any underlying medical conditions. And an EKG to evaluate your heart’s electrical activity. These are standard procedures. It's a precaution, Ms. Slavern, not a declaration of illness.
PATIENT: Oh. That sounds like… a lot. Will it cost a lot of money? My Medicare… does it cover all that? I'm worried about bills, Doctor. I don’t have a lot saved up.
DOCTOR: That is a matter for the billing department, Ms. Slavern. Medicare should cover the majority of these tests, but I cannot guarantee it. You will receive a bill detailing any out-of-pocket expenses. Now, let's focus on getting these tests scheduled. I will have my nurse draw the blood today, and we'll book you for an EKG next week. We’ll also need you to monitor your blood pressure at home. I’ll have the nurse show you how to use a home monitoring device. It’s critical we gather more data.
PATIENT: Okay. Home monitoring… I guess that makes sense. I just… I don’t want to worry my sister. She gets so anxious already. And I really don’t like needles. Will the nurse be gentle?
DOCTOR: The nurse is perfectly competent, Ms. Slavern. It will be a quick procedure. We’ll need that data, however. And as for your sister…that is your concern, not mine. We’ve covered the necessary steps. I’ll see you next week to discuss the results. If you experience any severe headaches, chest pain, or vision changes before then, go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any further questions?
PATIENT: No, I think that's all for now. Thank you, Doctor. I’ll try not to worry too much. And I’ll see if I can find someone to help me learn that machine.
DOCTOR: Very well. Good day, Ms. Slavern. .
