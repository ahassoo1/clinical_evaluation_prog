DOCTOR: Good morning, Mrs. Derasmo. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Stilaire. It’s lovely to meet you. Please, have a seat. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… a pleasure, I suppose. Though I don’t often enjoy discussing these things. I’m here because… well, I’ve been feeling rather down lately. It’s difficult to explain. Just… not myself. I hope we can be brief, if possible. I have commitments, you see.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mrs. Derasmo. It’s perfectly alright if you find it difficult to articulate. We’ll proceed at your pace, and I assure you, I will do my best to be efficient. “Not yourself” can mean many things. Could you elaborate a little on what that feels like for you?
PATIENT: It’s… a lack of enjoyment, mostly. Things I used to find fulfilling – my garden, even seeing my grandchildren – they don’t… spark joy, as the young people say. It’s not sadness, exactly. More like… emptiness. And a great deal of fatigue. I sleep, but it doesn’t feel like rest. Do you understand? It's quite bothersome, honestly. I used to be so active, always doing something. Now… it’s just… difficult to start anything.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mrs. Derasmo, I understand perfectly. A loss of enjoyment, fatigue that isn’t relieved by sleep, and difficulty initiating activities… those are all important things to note. It sounds quite debilitating, and I appreciate you sharing this with me. To help me get a clearer picture, could you tell me how long you’ve been experiencing these feelings?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That's a difficult question. It wasn’t sudden, you see. It’s been… creeping up on me, I suppose, for… perhaps six months now? It started with just feeling a bit more tired than usual, then the lack of interest followed. I initially dismissed it as getting older, you know? But it hasn’t improved. It’s… persistent. Six months, give or take. Is that helpful? I’m not good at remembering dates precisely.
DOCTOR: Yes, that is very helpful, Mrs. Derasmo. Six months of persistent symptoms is important information. It does sound like this is more than just a passing phase. Now, have you noticed any other changes alongside the fatigue and lack of enjoyment?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. My appetite hasn’t been the best. I’m not losing weight, but I certainly don’t feel hungry like I used to. And… my memory is not what it once was, naturally, at my age. But I’ve noticed it’s… worse, perhaps? I forget names easily, and sometimes struggle to find the right words. Small things, mostly. Oh, and I’ve been… more irritable, I believe. Snapping at my grandchildren, which I feel dreadful about. Is that… relevant? I truly don’t want to be a bother.
DOCTOR: Those are all relevant details, Mrs. Derasmo, and you are not a bother at all. Changes in appetite, increased forgetfulness, and irritability are things we need to consider. Could you describe a typical day for me, if you don’t mind?
PATIENT: Oh dear. A typical day… Well, I wake up, usually around seven. I have a small breakfast – toast, perhaps, or a piece of fruit, though I rarely feel very hungry. I’ll read the newspaper, though it doesn’t hold my attention for long. I used to spend hours in my garden, but now I just… sit there, mostly. My housekeeper comes three times a week, which is a blessing. I’ll have a light lunch, perhaps a sandwich. In the afternoon, I might watch television, or try to read. Evenings are much the same. I try to call my children and grandchildren, but sometimes I just… don’t have the energy. It's rather monotonous, to be frank. And lacking in… purpose, I suppose. Is that sufficient detail? I truly do apologize for rambling.
DOCTOR: No apology necessary, Mrs. Derasmo. That’s a very helpful overview. It sounds like your daily routine has become less engaging, and you’ve experienced a decrease in your usual activities. Now, I’d like to ask about your medical history, if you’re comfortable with that. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Let me see… I had my gallbladder removed many years ago, in my early fifties. And I was diagnosed with high blood pressure about fifteen years ago, which I manage with medication. Apart from that… nothing significant, I believe. I’ve always been quite healthy, generally. A few aches and pains, as one would expect at my age, but nothing that required serious treatment. I had the usual childhood illnesses, of course – measles, mumps, things of that nature. I'm sure my doctor has a more detailed record, but I'm afraid my memory isn't what it used to be. Would you like me to try and recall anything else?
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mrs. Derasmo. That’s very helpful. Gallbladder removal and managed hypertension are important to know. And are you currently taking any medications for your blood pressure, or for any other conditions?
PATIENT: Yes, I am. I take Lisinopril, 20 milligrams, once a day, for my blood pressure. And… occasionally, I take Paracetamol for aches and pains, but only when needed. Perhaps two or three times a month, if that. I also take a Vitamin D supplement, as my doctor recommended it a few years ago. I believe it’s to help with my bones. I’m quite diligent about taking my Lisinopril, though sometimes I forget the Vitamin D. Is that sufficient detail? I do apologize for being so forgetful. It’s truly frustrating.
DOCTOR: No apologies necessary at all, Mrs. Derasmo. It's perfectly understandable. Lisinopril 20mg daily, occasional Paracetamol, and Vitamin D supplement – that’s good to know. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I'm aware of. I've never had a reaction to any medication, food, or… anything, really. I've always been quite fortunate in that regard. No allergies. I can eat anything, thankfully. My grandchildren are quite allergic to peanuts, but that's neither here nor there. I just wanted to clarify that wasn't me. No allergies, thankfully. Is that what you needed to know?
DOCTOR: That’s excellent, Mrs. Derasmo. No known allergies is good information. Now, I'd like to ask a few questions about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. My mother had diabetes, type 2, I believe. And my father had heart problems, though I don’t recall the specifics. He passed away when I was quite young. My brother has arthritis, and my sister has… well, she’s always been a bit frail, health-wise. Nothing particularly serious, I suppose. Just the usual aches and pains of aging, mostly. My maternal grandmother had dementia, I believe. It was a long time ago, so my memory is a bit hazy. Is that helpful? It’s difficult to recall specifics. My family wasn't terribly forthcoming with medical details, to be frank.
DOCTOR: Yes, that is helpful, Mrs. Derasmo. History of diabetes, heart problems, arthritis, and dementia in the family – those are important to note. Now, I’d like to ask a few questions about your social habits. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no. I've never smoked a day in my life. My late husband smoked, unfortunately, but I always discouraged it. I do enjoy a glass of wine with dinner occasionally – perhaps once or twice a week. A small glass, mind you. Nothing excessive. And I certainly don't partake in any… recreational drugs. Never have, never will. I lead a very quiet life, to be frank. Is that what you needed to know? I do hope I’m not boring you with all this detail.
DOCTOR: Not at all, Mrs. Derasmo. That’s good to know. Occasional small glass of wine is perfectly fine. Now, before we move on, I’d like to do a brief physical examination, if you are comfortable with that. It will involve listening to your heart and lungs, checking your blood pressure, and a few other basic checks. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that's… acceptable. Though I do hope it won't take too long. I have commitments, you see. But yes, you may proceed. I trust your judgment, Doctor. Just please be gentle. My bones aren't what they used to be.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mrs. Derasmo. I’ll be as gentle as possible. We'll start with your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is 142/88, which is slightly elevated. Your heart sounds are regular, though I do detect a slight murmur. Your lung sounds are clear, but there is some diminished breath sound at the bases. Your abdomen is soft and non-tender. Your reflexes are slightly diminished, but within normal limits. Alright, Mrs. Derasmo. That concludes the brief physical exam. I have noted slightly elevated blood pressure, a slight heart murmur, diminished breath sounds at the bases, and diminished reflexes. Based on what you’ve told me, and the physical exam findings, I’m concerned about possible underlying depression, and the need to rule out other causes for your fatigue and lack of energy. I would like to order some blood tests to check your thyroid function, vitamin levels, and complete blood count. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… reasonable. Blood tests are acceptable. Though I do hope they won’t take too long to process. And I trust they won’t be too… invasive? I truly appreciate you taking the time to listen to my concerns, Doctor. It’s been… a relief to finally discuss this with someone. Though I still maintain I’m simply getting old, perhaps that’s all it is. But yes, proceed with the tests. Whatever you deem necessary.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mrs. Derasmo. It's my pleasure. The blood tests are not invasive at all—just a small sample taken from your arm. They will help us rule out any underlying medical causes for your symptoms. I’ll write the order for the blood tests now, and the nurse will come in shortly to draw the sample. We should have the results back in a few days. In the meantime, I would like to schedule a follow-up appointment in one week to discuss the results and explore potential treatment options if needed. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, a follow-up appointment in one week sounds… adequate. Though I must warn you, my schedule is rather busy. But yes, proceed with the booking. I suppose it’s best to be thorough. And thank you again for your time, Doctor. I truly appreciate your patience. I do hope these tests reveal nothing too serious. Though, frankly, at my age, what is serious anymore? Still, it’s best to be sure, I suppose.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mrs. Derasmo. I understand your concerns, and we’ll take things one step at a time. I've scheduled your follow-up appointment for next Tuesday at 2:00 PM. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood. If you experience any significant changes in your symptoms before then, please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic. Thank you for coming in today. Have a pleasant afternoon, Mrs. Derasmo.
