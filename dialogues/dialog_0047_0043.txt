DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Gibbel. I’m Dr. Press. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Please, call me Percell. Well, I've got this headache. Right in the back of my head, at the base of my skull. It's been bothering me for...oh, goodness, maybe a week now? Not constant, comes and goes, but it's definitely there more often than not lately.
DOCTOR: A week, you say?
PATIENT: Yep. A week, give or take a day or two. You know how it is when you get older, time kinda...blurs. But I remember noticing it after I helped my grandson with some yard work last Saturday. We were clearing brush, a good bit of bending and lifting. Not heavy lifting, but enough to feel it. Could be that, maybe? I just figured it was a muscle strain at first, but it hasn't gone away like it usually does.
DOCTOR: Yard work, alright. And you've never experienced anything like this before with similar activity?
PATIENT: Hmm. Not exactly like this, no. I've had stiff necks after gardening, sure. Or a little ache in my shoulders. But this is...different. More of a throbbing, right at the very back. And it sometimes feels like it radiates a little, down my neck, but not all the way to my shoulders. Hard to explain, really. It’s not a sharp pain, more of a dull pressure. Does that make any sense? I’m not good at describing these things.
DOCTOR: It’s…sufficient. Have you noticed any other symptoms alongside this headache, Percell?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think. No fever, definitely not. No blurry vision, no dizziness. Haven’t felt nauseous at all. I have been a little more tired than usual, now that you mention it. But I just figured that was from being an old man! <chuckles softly> Seriously though, no, nothing major. Just the headache and a bit of extra sleepiness. My appetite's been normal, I still enjoy my morning sticky rice, thankfully. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications for anything at all, Percell?
PATIENT: No, ma'am. Not a one. I try to stay away from pills as much as possible, if I can. Always believed in letting the body heal itself. My daughter, she worries, tells me I should be on something for my blood pressure. But the doctor before, Dr. Chen, he said it was just a little elevated, nothing to fuss over. He told me to watch my salt intake and get some exercise, which I try to do. Mostly walking. But no medications, no. Not at all.
DOCTOR: And any allergies to medications or anything else, Percell?
PATIENT: Nope, not that I know of. Never had a bad reaction to anything. My wife, God rest her soul, she had a bit of a sensitivity to penicillin, but I didn’t. I’ve always been pretty lucky that way, I guess. <pauses thoughtfully> Actually...now that you mention it, I did get a rash once, a long time ago, after eating some wild mushrooms my brother found. But that was a long time ago, and I'm pretty sure it wasn’t an allergy, just a bad mushroom! <chuckles weakly> Don't eat things you don't recognize, that's what I always say.
DOCTOR: Right. Well. Let’s do a quick physical exam, shall we?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. Just let me know if there’s anything I need to do. I’m not very flexible these days, you know. <chuckles, wincing slightly as he shifts in his chair> But I’ll try my best to cooperate.
DOCTOR: If you'll just sit up there for me. I'm going to check your blood pressure and listen to your heart and lungs, and then I’ll take a look at your neck and range of motion. Please let me know if anything feels particularly painful. Blood pressure is 148 over 92. A little elevated, as you mentioned. Heart sounds are regular, lungs are clear. Some mild tenderness to palpation at the base of the skull, bilaterally. Range of motion is slightly limited in flexion and extension, but no acute muscle spasm. Neurological exam is grossly intact. Strength is 5/5 in all extremities. No sensory deficits noted.
PATIENT: Okay. That sounds… about right, I guess. Been a bit stressed lately, with my grandson starting college and all. The worry gets to me, I suppose. Stress and old age, a bad combination. And yes, I do feel a little stiff. <rubs the back of his neck> It's just a dull ache, though. Not like a sharp pain. Is that…concerning? You said it's a little limited, the range of motion...what does that mean, exactly?
DOCTOR: It could be tension headache related to stress and muscle strain, as you say. The limited range of motion suggests some degree of muscle tightness, likely contributing to the discomfort. However, given your age and the persistence of the symptoms, we shouldn’t rule out other possibilities. I'm going to order a basic blood work panel to rule out any underlying inflammatory conditions. And, just to be safe, I’d like you to get an X-ray of your cervical spine to assess the bony structures. We need to rule out anything more serious.
PATIENT: Oh. X-ray, huh? <frowns slightly> That sounds…serious. I haven't had an X-ray in years. Is it something to worry about? I mean, I’ve been feeling alright, other than the headache, and a little bit of tiredness. What are you looking for, exactly? I'm not trying to be difficult, Doctor, I just like to know what's going on. My wife always said knowledge is power. <shifts in his chair, looking a bit anxious> Is it expensive? I'm on a fixed income, you know. I don't have a lot of extra money for tests.
DOCTOR: Mr. Gibbel, I understand your concerns. An X-ray is a simple imaging test. It allows us to visualize the bones in your neck and identify any potential abnormalities, such as arthritis or bone spurs, that could be contributing to your symptoms. It’s a precautionary measure, and doesn’t necessarily mean anything is seriously wrong. As for the cost, I’m not able to give you a precise figure, but I can have our billing department contact you to discuss potential options for financial assistance. We do have programs available for patients with limited income. It is important to investigate this further. Delaying diagnosis could potentially lead to more serious complications down the line. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, I understand. <nods slowly> You’re right, of course. It's better to be safe than sorry. My wife would have told me the same thing. Always said I worried too much, but she was right about everything. <chuckles softly, then winces slightly> Okay, X-ray it is. And I appreciate you having the billing department contact me about the cost. That’s a big help. <stage>Looks at Doctor Press with a hopeful expression> So, what do I do now? Do I schedule it here, or do I go somewhere else? And is there anything I should do in the meantime? Any pain relievers you recommend? Maybe just some ibuprofen? I've got some at home.
DOCTOR: You can schedule the X-ray at the imaging center across the street. I’ll have the order sent over electronically. As for pain relief, ibuprofen is fine, as long as you don’t have any contraindications – kidney problems, stomach ulcers, etc. Follow the dosage instructions on the bottle. I’ll also send you home with a referral to a physical therapist. They can teach you some exercises to improve your neck mobility and reduce muscle tension. We’ll review the results of the X-ray and discuss further treatment options at your follow-up appointment in two weeks. Any other questions?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Physical therapist…okay, good. I’ve always liked a good massage, so maybe that will help. And I’ll get the X-ray done right away, and take the ibuprofen. <pauses, thoughtfully> You said two weeks for the follow-up? That’s a bit of a wait, isn’t it? I hope it’s nothing serious. <shifts in his chair, looking a little anxious> But thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me, and for explaining everything so clearly. <smiles weakly> You're a very thorough doctor.
DOCTOR: You're welcome. The wait time is standard procedure for imaging results. We need to ensure a thorough review before discussing anything further. The nurse will contact you to schedule your follow-up appointment. Have a good day, Mr. Gibbel.
