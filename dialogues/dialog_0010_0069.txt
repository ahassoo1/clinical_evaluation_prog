DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Paguió. I'm Dr. Annesley. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. I’m here for a vaccination, I think. Or, well, an immunization. My wife helped me book the appointment, and she just said I needed to get one done. I wasn’t quite sure which one, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s perfectly alright. It’s common to let family members handle these details. Let me take a look… Ah, yes. It appears your wife scheduled you for a Tdap booster – that’s tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis. It’s recommended every ten years, or with any significant injury. Have you had a tetanus shot before, to your knowledge?
PATIENT: Yes, I have. Quite a few, actually. When I was younger, working… always getting little cuts and scrapes. And I think I had one when I first came to this country, a long time ago. So, definitely had tetanus shots before. I can’t recall exactly when the last one was, though. It’s been a while.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. And do you recall ever having any reaction to a tetanus shot in the past – any swelling, redness, fever, or anything like that?
PATIENT: Hmm… no, not that I remember. Nothing serious, anyway. Maybe a little soreness in my arm for a day or so, but nothing that bothered me too much. Just the usual, I suppose. I don’t usually pay much attention to those little things, if you know what I mean. As long as it didn’t knock me off my feet, I figured I was alright.
DOCTOR: Right, I understand. Just checking for any history of adverse reactions. Your record doesn't show any specific allergies, which is good. And are you currently taking any medications, Mr. Paguió?
PATIENT: No, sir. Nothing at all. I try to stay healthy, eat well, you know? I don’t really like taking pills if I can avoid it. Just a multivitamin now and then, but that’s about it. Nothing prescribed by a doctor, anyway.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. And do you have any medical conditions that I should be aware of – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, heart problems, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, thankfully. I've been pretty lucky with my health, so far. I watch my weight, try to get some exercise when I can, but generally, I feel alright. My wife always worries about me, makes me go for check-ups, but the doctors always say I’m doing okay. A little achy sometimes, getting older, you know, but nothing major.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s good to hear. Now, before we proceed with the vaccination, let’s just do a quick physical exam. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, and just take a look at your general condition. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, absolutely. That sounds perfectly fine. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. Just let me know if there’s anything I need to do on my end. I’m ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Paguió, take a deep breath in… and out… Good. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear bilaterally. Lymph nodes are normal, no swelling. Blood pressure is 130/80, pulse is 72 and regular. Ears are clear, throat looks normal, no redness or swelling. Overall, everything seems good. Do you have any pain anywhere?
PATIENT: No pain, Doctor. Not at all. Everything feels… normal, I suppose. Like you said, just getting a little older, maybe a bit stiff in the mornings, but nothing that bothers me too much. I appreciate you checking everything so thoroughly. It’s reassuring.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good. Given your history and the exam findings, you are a suitable candidate for the Tdap booster. Do you have any questions for me before we proceed with the vaccination?
PATIENT: No, sir, I don’t think so. You’ve explained everything very clearly, and I trust your judgment. If you think it’s a good idea, then I’m happy to go ahead with it. I just want to get it done and over with, to be honest. I don't particularly like needles, but I know it’s important.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s get this done quickly then. This might sting for a moment, but it’s quick. Just relax your arm… Okay, here we go… There. All done. Keep that bandage on for about fifteen minutes, and avoid strenuous activity with that arm for the rest of the day. I'll have you wait in the waiting room for fifteen minutes after the shot to monitor for any reaction. Is there anything else I can do for you today?
PATIENT: Oh! That wasn't so bad, actually. A little pinch, but you're right, it was quick. Thank you, Doctor. No, I think that’s all. Fifteen minutes, and then I can go home? That sounds perfect. I appreciate your kindness and patience.
DOCTOR: Excellent. We'll have the nurse come check on you in fifteen minutes. Here is some information about possible side effects, and what to do if you experience them. And if you experience any severe reaction – difficulty breathing, swelling of the face or throat – please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Otherwise, some mild soreness or redness at the injection site is normal and should resolve within a day or two. Do you have any questions about this information?
PATIENT: No, that all makes sense. I’ll be sure to watch for those things, just in case. Thank you for the information, and for everything, Doctor. I think I'm all set. I’ll just go sit in the waiting room now.
DOCTOR: Alright. Have a good day, Mr. Paguió. And don’t hesitate to call if you have any concerns. .
PATIENT: .
