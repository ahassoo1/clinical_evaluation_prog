DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. McNabb. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Reisig. It’s lovely to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s very nice to meet you as well. Oh, my, you have a lovely office. Well, to be quite frank, I’m hoping you can help me get a bit of… well, a reset. A jumpstart, really. I’m 87 years young, and things just aren’t working like they used to. Not broken, exactly, just… slower. And I’d like to keep it that way, if possible!
DOCTOR: I completely understand, Ms. McNabb. It's very common to experience changes as we get older, and wanting to maintain your current level of function is a wonderful goal. “Reset” and “jumpstart” are good ways to put it! To help me get a better understanding of what’s been going on, could you tell me a little more about what specifically feels “slower” or isn’t working like it used to?
PATIENT: Well, it’s a little bit of everything, really. My energy isn’t what it used to be, of course. I used to be able to garden all day, and now… a little weeding is about all I can manage. And my memory… it’s not bad, but I forget things more easily. Names, mostly. And where I put my glasses! But mostly, it’s just a general feeling of… being worn out. Not sick, just… tired. I still enjoy my life, I really do! I just want to enjoy it more easily, you see?
DOCTOR: I absolutely understand, Ms. McNabb. It sounds like you're experiencing a gradual decline in energy and some memory changes, and that's impacting your enjoyment of daily activities. That’s a perfectly valid concern, and we can definitely explore what might be going on. Let's start with your energy levels. You mentioned being able to garden all day previously. How long ago was that, approximately?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… maybe ten years ago? Perhaps a little more. I was still quite active then. I was volunteering at the school, helping with the little ones, and gardening, of course. I used to have the most beautiful hibiscus. Now, I struggle just getting the mail. It’s not a huge effort, but it’s… different. And it’s getting progressively harder, you see? I don’t want to end up needing help with everything.
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful to know, Ms. McNabb. A gradual change over ten years is important information. It sounds like it’s a progressive decline, which is good to be aware of. Now, thinking about your memory, you mentioned forgetting names mostly. Has this been a recent change, or has it been ongoing for a while as well?
PATIENT: Oh, the memory… it’s come on slowly, I think. It wasn’t sudden. At first, it was just occasionally misplacing things. Keys, mostly. Then it started being names. People I should remember. Friends, even. It’s frustrating, because I know I know them! But the name just… slips away. And like I said, where I put my glasses! My daughter jokes that I’m always losing them. But it’s a bit more than that, honestly. It worries me a little, you see? Not that I'm losing my mind, but… well, it’s unsettling.
DOCTOR: It's completely understandable that it's unsettling, Ms. McNabb. It's good that you're aware of these changes and are voicing your concerns. Slow, progressive memory loss like you describe does warrant further investigation to determine the cause. Let’s move on to some other things. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite recently?
PATIENT: Oh, my appetite… it’s been a bit smaller, I suppose. I don’t eat badly, but I don’t have the same hunger I used to. I used to love a good plate of lumpia, but now… a few pieces is enough. And I don’t really crave things like I used to. My daughter is always telling me to eat more. She worries, of course. She’s a good girl. But I’m just not as hungry. It's not a big deal, I don’t think.
DOCTOR: Okay, a decreased appetite and reduced cravings. That's helpful to know. Has there been any unintentional weight loss recently, perhaps a few pounds over the past few months?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Now that you mention it… yes, I think so. My daughter weighed me last time she visited, and I think I was a couple of pounds lighter than usual. Not a lot, mind you. But enough to notice. I hadn't really thought about it, to be honest. I’ve just been… less energetic, and haven't been eating as much. It's probably nothing, but you’re right to ask, I suppose. My daughter always says I should be more careful about these things.
DOCTOR: It's good you mentioned that, Ms. McNabb. Even a small amount of unintentional weight loss is worth noting. Now, let’s talk a little about your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions that we should be aware of?
PATIENT: Oh, my. Let me think… I had my gallbladder out years ago. And I have a bit of arthritis in my knees, which is why I don't garden as much anymore. It flares up sometimes, but it’s mostly manageable with over-the-counter medication. And… well, I had a bit of a scare with my heart a long time ago, but they put a stent in and it’s been fine ever since. I see my cardiologist every year for checkups. Is that everything? I can’t always remember everything!
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful, Ms. McNabb. Gallbladder removal, arthritis, and a history of heart issues with a stent placement – I appreciate you sharing that. And don't worry about remembering everything; that's what my notes are for. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Let me see… I take a little bit of ibuprofen for my knees when they bother me. And I take a daily multivitamin, of course. My daughter makes sure I do. She says it’s good for old people! And… oh, yes. I take a little bit of something for my blood pressure. A small white pill. I’m not sure of the name, to be honest. My daughter handles all the refills, so I just take what she gives me. I’m not very good with these things.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. McNabb. It’s common to have help with medications as we get older. We can definitely look up the name of the blood pressure pill to be sure. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, no, not that I know of. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything. Not that I can remember, anyway! My mother always said I had a strong stomach. No allergies, no. I can eat all sorts of things, thankfully. I do love a good mango, when they’re in season! No allergies, no. I’m pretty lucky that way.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, Ms. McNabb. No known allergies. Now, before we move on to a quick physical exam, could you tell me a little bit about your family history?
PATIENT: Oh, my family… Well, my mother lived to be 92, which is quite good. She had a bit of arthritis, like me, but she was mostly healthy. My father died younger, in his 70s, from a heart problem, I think. He didn’t take very good care of himself, always smoking and eating rich foods. And my brother… he had diabetes, which is why I try to eat healthy, even though I don’t have a big appetite. Mostly, we’re a pretty healthy bunch, all things considered. Although, everyone seems to have trouble with their knees as they get older!
DOCTOR: That’s helpful, Ms. McNabb. History of longevity in your mother, heart issues in your father, and diabetes in your brother. Now, may I ask about your social history?
PATIENT: Oh, my social history? Well, I was married to my husband for over 50 years. A wonderful man. He passed away a few years ago. I miss him terribly. I have two children, a son and a daughter. They both live nearby and visit often, thankfully. I used to volunteer at the school, helping the little ones with their reading, but I haven't been able to do that lately. I mostly stay home now, reading and watching television. I do enjoy my garden, when I have the energy. It's a quiet life, but a good life.
DOCTOR: That sounds like a lovely life, Ms. McNabb, and I'm very sorry for your loss. It's wonderful that your children are nearby and supportive. Now, to help get a better picture of what’s going on, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s perfectly alright. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgment. I’m ready when you are. Just let me know if anything feels uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I will certainly let you know. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a few deep breaths for me. Your heart sounds regular, with a mild murmur, which we know about from your cardiologist visits. Lung sounds are clear. Your abdomen is soft, and I don't feel any tenderness. Your reflexes are a bit diminished, which is common at your age. Your gait is a bit slower than average, but stable. Overall, your physical exam findings are consistent with your age and medical history. There are no major concerns at this time. However, given your concerns about energy levels, memory changes, and weight loss, I’d like to order a few blood tests to rule out any underlying causes. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds very sensible, Doctor. Blood tests are a good idea. I’d rather be safe than sorry. Whatever you think is necessary, I trust your judgment. I’m happy to get them done. What sort of things will they be looking for? If you don't mind me asking.
DOCTOR: Of course, I’m happy to explain. The blood tests will include a complete blood count to check for anemia, which can cause fatigue. We'll also check your thyroid function, as an underactive thyroid can cause similar symptoms. We'll assess your vitamin D levels, as deficiency is common and can cause weakness. And we'll check your blood sugar to rule out diabetes. We’ll also do a basic metabolic panel to check your kidney and liver function. It's a fairly standard set of tests to get a good overall picture. We'll also run a test for B12 levels, as this can affect memory. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Doctor. Anemia, thyroid, vitamins, blood sugar… all very important things. And the B12 for the memory, of course. You’ve thought of everything! It sounds very thorough, and I feel much better knowing you’re looking into all of these things. Will I need to fast before the blood draw? And where will I have it done?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. McNabb. It’s my pleasure. Yes, you will need to fast for at least eight hours before the blood draw, meaning no food or drink except water. You can have the blood draw done at the lab right here in the clinic, on the third floor. I'll give you a lab requisition form and instructions after our visit today. They're open until 5 PM, and you don't need an appointment. Once the results are back, which usually takes a few days, we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms, please don't hesitate to contact the clinic. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so, Doctor. You've explained everything very clearly. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me and taking my concerns seriously. I feel much more hopeful now that we’re getting to the bottom of things. Thank you. I'll go and get the blood tests done tomorrow morning.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. McNabb. I’m glad I could help. Remember, taking care of your health is a team effort, and I’m here to support you every step of the way. Please, don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. I will have the lab requisition form ready for you before you leave. And I’ll also provide you with some written information about healthy aging and things you can do to maintain your energy levels. Do you need a work note for any time you might miss while at the lab tomorrow?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s very kind of you to offer, Doctor, but no, I don’t think so. I’m retired now, thankfully! No need for work notes. But I do appreciate the thought. I think that's everything for today, then. Thank you again for your time and your help. You've been wonderful.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Well, it was a pleasure meeting you, Ms. McNabb. I’ll get that requisition form for you now, and we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment once the results are back. Please don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before then. Have a lovely day.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too.
