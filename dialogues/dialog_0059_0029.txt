DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Obarr. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Romario Chagaris. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, to begin, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Well, it's this…feeling full really quick. I don’t eat much as it is, being an old man and all, but lately, even just a little bit of food and I feel like I’ve had a big meal. It's been happening for a couple of weeks now, I’d say.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Mr. Obarr. It’s helpful to know how long this has been going on. So, you’re experiencing a feeling of fullness relatively quickly, even with small amounts of food, and this has been present for approximately two weeks. Could you describe what you typically eat in a day, just so I have a better understanding of your usual diet?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think. Breakfast usually isn’t much – maybe a piece of toast with a little bit of jam, and a cup of tea. Lunch is often a sandwich – ham and cheese, usually. Nothing fancy. And dinner… well, my wife usually makes something. Soup is common, or maybe some fish and potatoes. Smaller portions these days, you know? I don’t have a huge appetite. It's not like I'm stuffing myself, that's for sure.
DOCTOR: Thank you. That gives me a good starting point. And you mentioned smaller portions these days – has your appetite been decreasing gradually, or did this feeling of fullness come on suddenly alongside this change in appetite?
PATIENT: It's been gradual, I'd say. Not like overnight or anything. Over the last… well, maybe six months or so, I haven't been wanting as much food. Then this feeling full thing just sort of… added itself on top of that. It's a bit worrying, to be honest. I used to enjoy my meals, even if they weren't big. Now… not so much.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Obarr. It's certainly worth investigating when something changes with your appetite and eating habits, especially when it's affecting your enjoyment of food. Besides the feeling of fullness and decreased appetite, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Let me think… well, I've been a little tired lately, more than usual. But being eighty-eight years old, that could just be old age, right? And… oh, sometimes my stomach feels a little queasy, not sick, just… unsettled. It happens after I eat, mostly. Not every time, though. It's hard to say if that's related, or just… my stomach being an old man's stomach.
DOCTOR: That's good information, Mr. Obarr. The fatigue and the occasional queasiness are both helpful to know. It's good you're able to distinguish that the queasiness often follows eating. Now, I’d like to ask a few questions about your medical history, if that’s alright. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me see. I had my gallbladder out years ago, must be forty years now. And… I had a bit of a heart flutter a while back, they gave me some pills for it, I take them every day. Can’t remember the name of ‘em, sorry. Other than that… not much. Just the usual aches and pains of getting old, I suppose. Nothing serious, never been a big sick man.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Obarr. That's helpful. So, you’ve had your gallbladder removed and you’re currently taking medication for a heart flutter. Do you recall if the heart flutter was atrial fibrillation or another type of arrhythmia?
PATIENT: Oh, now you're asking questions I can't answer! I just know the doctor said something about my heart beating funny and gave me these pills. I don't recall the fancy words, sorry. My wife usually handles all the details with the doctors, I just take what she gives me. I’m not very good with remembering medical stuff, you see. It all goes in one ear and out the other.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Mr. Obarr. It’s common to not remember all the specifics. We can certainly look that up in your records if you’d be comfortable with me checking the computer. While I do that, could you tell me about any surgeries you’ve had besides the gallbladder removal?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… I had my appendix out when I was a boy, a long time ago. And… I had a knee replacement about ten years ago. That's about it, I think. Nothing major, really. Just the usual wear and tear of a long life, you see. My wife will probably remember more details if you need 'em. She's got a very good memory.
DOCTOR: Thank you. So, gallbladder removal, appendectomy, and a knee replacement. Now, I'd like to ask about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family, such as heart disease, cancer, or digestive problems?
PATIENT: Hmm. That’s a good question. My mother, she had… what was it? Something with her stomach, I think. She was always complaining about it. Not sure what the doctor called it. And my father… he had heart trouble, I think. He died young, from a heart attack, I believe. My wife knows more about all that, she’s the family historian, really. I just know they both had problems, one with their stomach and the other with their heart. It’s a bit fuzzy, you see. It was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Obarr. That's helpful to know—a history of stomach problems in your mother and heart trouble in your father. Now, could you tell me about any medications you are currently taking, besides the one for your heart flutter?
PATIENT: Let me think... Oh, I take something for my arthritis, it's a little blue pill. Can't remember the name of it either, sorry. And… sometimes, if I'm really bothered, I take a painkiller for my back. Just over-the-counter stuff, you know, ibuprofen or something like that. Nothing regular, just when I need it. That’s about it, I think. My wife keeps track of everything, really. I’m not much good with remembering all these names.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Obarr. So, medication for your heart flutter, a blue pill for arthritis, and over-the-counter pain relievers as needed. Now, just a couple more questions, then I’d like to do a brief physical exam. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. Never had a problem with allergies, thankfully. My wife always asks when she fills out the forms, and I always say no. I’m pretty lucky that way, I suppose. I can eat anything, take most pills without a problem. Still, I try not to take too many pills, if I can help it.
DOCTOR: That's good to know, Mr. Obarr. No known allergies. Finally, could you tell me a little bit about your social history?
PATIENT: Oh, my social history? Well, I’ve been married to my wife, Elsie, for sixty years now. Wonderful woman. We have two grown children, both with families of their own. I used to work as a radio announcer, back in the day. Retired now, of course. I enjoy gardening, when my back lets me. And I like to read, mostly history books. Pretty quiet life these days, but I’m content. I don’t drink or smoke, never have. Always been a pretty healthy fella, all things considered.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Obarr. That gives me a good picture. Now, if you’re comfortable, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a better understanding of what might be going on. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and I’ll gently feel your abdomen to check for any tenderness or abnormalities. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that's fine, Doctor. Go ahead. I trust your judgment. Just be gentle with my old bones, alright? Elsie always says I'm fragile. But do what you need to do. I'm ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Obarr. I will be as gentle as possible. Your heart rate is a bit slow, but that’s not necessarily a concern given your medication. Lungs sound clear. And now, feeling your abdomen… There is some mild tenderness in the upper abdomen, on the right side. It’s not sharp pain, but you do tense up a bit when I press there. Anything else bother you when I press here?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s… that feels a bit uncomfortable. It’s been feeling like that for a while now, sort of a dull ache. Not constant, but it comes and goes. Especially after I eat, I think. It’s not terrible, just… annoying. My wife says I should probably get it checked out, which is why I'm here. I just figured it was old age, you know? But maybe she's right. It does seem to get worse after food.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Obarr. That’s helpful to know—the tenderness is in the upper abdomen, especially after eating. I don't feel any obvious masses or enlarged organs. Based on what you've told me and the findings of the exam, several possibilities come to mind. Given your age, history of heart problems, and the tenderness in your upper abdomen, it could be related to your gallbladder, even though you had it removed years ago—sometimes there can be complications. It could also be related to your stomach, or something else entirely. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order some blood tests to check your liver function, and a complete blood count. I also recommend an abdominal ultrasound to visualize your gallbladder, liver, and other organs in more detail. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds sensible, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. Blood tests and an ultrasound… alright. Elsie will be glad I'm getting it checked out properly. She always worries about me. If that's what you recommend, then let's do it. Just let me know when and where I need to go. And what I need to do to prepare, if anything.
DOCTOR: Excellent, Mr. Obarr. I’m glad you agree. I’ll write the orders for the blood tests and ultrasound now. The blood tests can be done here at the clinic, and we can schedule the ultrasound for next week. You don’t need to do anything special to prepare for either test. Once the results are back, we’ll review them together and discuss the next steps. It’s likely we’ll get the results within a few days. In the meantime, if you experience any worsening pain, fever, or nausea, please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so, Doctor. You've explained everything very clearly. Elsie will probably have a million questions later, but I'm alright for now. Just getting it checked out is a relief. Thank you for listening to me, and for taking the time. I appreciate it.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Obarr. I'm glad I could help. It was a pleasure meeting you. Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns. The nurse will be with you shortly to schedule your ultrasound and draw your blood. Have a good day, and please give Elsie my best.
