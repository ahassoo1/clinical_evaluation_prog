DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Purtee, good morning. I’m Dr. Donate. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s a little embarrassing, to be honest. I’ve noticed a change in my… body odor. It’s not like I suddenly smell bad, exactly. It’s just… different. Not a good different, if that makes sense. It started a couple of weeks ago, I think.
DOCTOR: Different how, exactly?
PATIENT: Hmm. It's hard to explain. It’s…sweeter, I guess? Like, usually I just smell like… well, like someone who works hard, you know? A little bit of sweat, a little bit of…life. But now there’s this…almost fruity smell. And it's not perfume or anything. I haven’t changed anything in my routine, not really. Same soap, same deodorant…everything. It just started. And it worries me because… well, I don’t want to smell like fruit, Doctor. Especially after a long day laying floors!
DOCTOR: Alright. Sweeter, you say. And it’s not associated with any new products, dietary changes, or increased sweating?
PATIENT: No, not that I’ve noticed. I eat the same things, pretty much. Injera and wat most days, sometimes some lentils. I haven’t been eating more fruit, definitely not. And I’ve been working the same amount as always, maybe even a little less with the heat this past week. It’s definitely not from working harder or anything. It’s just…there. I noticed it first when I was taking off my work boots at the end of the day, and then again this morning when I was getting ready. It's subtle, but I know my own smell, you know?
DOCTOR: Right, you know your own smell. Okay. And have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Let me think… Not really. I mean, I'm getting older, things ache a bit more than they used to, but that’s just…life, right? I haven't been feeling sick, no fever, no weight loss or gain. I sleep okay. My appetite is normal. Honestly, the only thing different is this… smell. It's just weirded me out. Is it… is it something serious, Doctor? I've been reading things online, and now I’m worried it’s something awful.
DOCTOR: Online can be…unhelpful. It’s good you came in to get it checked out. It’s unlikely to be anything “awful,” but we need to investigate. Now, let’s talk a bit about your medical history. Do you have any significant medical conditions – diabetes, for instance?
PATIENT: No, no diabetes. My mother had high blood pressure, but I don’t. I had my gallbladder out about ten years ago, but that’s it. And I get my Medicare checkups, so they usually catch anything big. The doctor always says I’m surprisingly healthy for someone who spends all day on my knees! I don’t take any regular medication, either. Just some ibuprofen for my knees sometimes, when they’re really bothering me.
DOCTOR: Alright, no diabetes, gallbladder out ten years ago, occasional ibuprofen… And any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope, no allergies. I can eat anything, take pretty much any medicine. My mother always said I had an iron stomach. She was a wonderful cook, but sometimes… well, sometimes things weren’t quite right, you know? I think that built up my immune system, if anything! Seriously, Doctor, I don’t usually worry about things like this. It's just this smell… It's so out of character for me. I feel silly even talking about it, but I wanted to make sure it wasn’t something serious.
DOCTOR: It's not silly at all to be concerned about changes in your body. And you’re right to get it checked out. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. Just to rule out anything obvious. We'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and I’d like to take a look at your skin, just to be thorough. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. I trust your judgment. It's just… I'm hoping it's nothing. I have a job to do, floors to lay, you know? I can’t be smelling like a fruit basket all day!
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's start with your blood pressure. Just relax your arm, please. 130 over 80. Not bad. Now, let's listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, lungs are clear. Now, if you don't mind, I'm going to take a quick look at your skin, particularly around your feet and groin area. Just to rule out any obvious fungal infections or anything else unusual.
PATIENT: Okay, go ahead. It’s probably nothing, right? I wash my feet every night, I really do. I get a lot of dirt on them during the day, obviously, but I always make sure to scrub them clean. I don't want to smell like a sweaty sock, I promise you! This is really strange. I haven't noticed any rash or anything, just… the smell. It’s like a faint sweetness, barely there.
DOCTOR: Alright. Skin looks normal. No obvious signs of infection or anything concerning. Now, this is a bit unusual, and frankly, it’s difficult to pinpoint the cause with just a physical exam. It could be a minor skin condition, or even a change in your body chemistry. However, to be thorough, I'd like to order a urine sample. Just to rule out any underlying metabolic issues. And I’m also going to order a basic blood panel – just to check your overall health and rule out anything systemic. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. I mean, if that’s what you think is best. Urine sample and blood panel, okay. I don't mind. I just… I’d like to know what’s going on. Is it something I need to worry about? I have a job, bills to pay, you know? I can’t be dealing with a serious illness right now. And will the blood panel tell you why I smell like fruit? That’s the part that really bothers me!
DOCTOR: The blood panel won’t necessarily tell us why you smell like fruit, specifically. But it will help us rule out any underlying medical conditions that could be contributing to it. It's unlikely to be anything serious, Ms. Purtee. But we need to be thorough. I’ll have the nurse come in and give you the paperwork for the lab tests. You'll need to collect a urine sample, and then head to the lab for the blood draw. Once we have the results, we can discuss them and determine the next steps. In the meantime, try not to worry too much. It could be something as simple as a minor skin condition that we haven’t identified yet. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers it. Just… the nurse will tell me where to go for the tests? And how long will it take to get the results? I have a big job starting next week, I need to know if I’m going to be able to work. I really appreciate you taking this seriously, Doctor. It sounds silly when I say it out loud, but it's been bothering me a lot. It's just… I don't want to smell like a fruit salad, you know?
DOCTOR: The nurse will guide you to the lab. The results usually take 2-3 business days. We’ll call you as soon as they’re available. And yes, I understand it’s unsettling. We’ll get to the bottom of it. It's unlikely to interfere with your work, but we need the test results to be sure. In the meantime, continue with your usual hygiene routine. And try not to stress about it. Stress can sometimes exacerbate unusual body odors. Do you have any other concerns I can address before you go?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you, Doctor. I really appreciate your time. I’ll go find the nurse. Hopefully, we’ll have some answers soon.
DOCTOR: Alright. Have a good day, Ms. Purtee. And don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. .
