DOCTOR: Right. Jailia Chakka, 18 years old. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor. It’s… rather bothersome, actually. I’ve been losing weight, which one would think is a good thing, but it’s happening despite… a perfectly reasonable diet. And I’m simply exhausted all the time, even with adequate rest. The night sweats are particularly disruptive, if you understand. It's most undignified.
DOCTOR: Weight loss despite a reasonable diet… adequate rest… and night sweats. Hmm. How long has this been going on, exactly?
PATIENT: Approximately three months now, Doctor. It began subtly, a slight decrease in appetite, a little more tiredness than usual. But it has progressed steadily since then. I assure you, I maintain a very disciplined lifestyle; it isn’t as if I’m indulging in… unhealthy habits. I believe a precise timeline is crucial for accurate assessment.
DOCTOR: Three months. And what, specifically, does this “disciplined lifestyle” entail?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, I adhere to a predominantly protein-based diet, with limited carbohydrates. I engage in regular Pilates – three times a week, with a certified instructor, naturally. I get approximately seven hours of sleep each night, and I avoid excessive stimulation before bed. No late-night television, no… frivolous socializing. A very structured existence, I assure you. I find routine is paramount.
DOCTOR: Pilates three times a week. Right. And you said a protein-based diet… could you elaborate on that?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Primarily lean meats – chicken breast, fish, occasionally beef. I also consume a significant amount of lentils and beans. I supplement with protein shakes, of course, to ensure adequate intake. I monitor my macronutrient levels meticulously, maintaining a strict balance. It’s hardly a haphazard approach, you understand. Though, I confess, the weight loss continues unabated. It's quite perplexing.
DOCTOR: Let's see… height 196cm, weight 105lbs?
PATIENT: Yes, that is correct, Doctor. 196 centimeters, 105 pounds. I am rather tall, you see. Which perhaps complicates matters. It's difficult to find clothing that fits appropriately, let alone maintain a… healthy weight, as it were. It's a constant struggle, and this recent, unexplained loss is deeply concerning.
DOCTOR: 105 pounds at 196 centimeters… That's… extremely low. Have you had any recent blood tests?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I haven’t. I generally avoid unnecessary medical intervention. I prefer to address issues proactively, through lifestyle adjustments, you see. It’s… inefficient to burden the healthcare system with trivial matters. However, the persistence of this weight loss, coupled with the fatigue and night sweats, is beginning to… unsettle me. Perhaps a blood test is… advisable, in this instance.
DOCTOR: Fine. We'll do some blood work. I'll order a complete metabolic panel, CBC, thyroid panel, and… let’s add a sedimentation rate just to be thorough. Nurse will be in to draw blood shortly. Don’t eat or drink anything except water after midnight. Is that understood?
PATIENT: Perfectly understood, Doctor. A complete metabolic panel, CBC, thyroid panel, and sedimentation rate. And no consumption of anything beyond water after midnight. I appreciate your thoroughness. I must confess, I find this entire situation rather… undignified, but I trust your expertise will yield a satisfactory explanation.
DOCTOR: Good. That’s all for now. The nurse will be with you shortly. We’ll review the results when they come back. Try to get some rest.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. I shall endeavor to rest. Thank you for your time. I await the results with… anticipation.
