DOCTOR: Good morning, Adyn. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Pfennig. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you as well. Um… well, to be honest, I’m not entirely sure what exactly brought me in. My husband, he said… something about my speech? He mentioned it sounded… off, I suppose. I haven't really noticed anything myself, but he was quite concerned. I’ve just been feeling a bit… out of it lately, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's perfectly alright. It’s common for others to notice things we don’t. It’s good your husband brought it to your attention. “Out of it” – can you tell me more about that?
PATIENT: Hmm… it’s hard to explain. Just… a little slow, maybe? And I’ve been forgetting things… small things, mostly. Like, I’ll go to put something somewhere and then completely blank on where I was going. Or I'll start a sentence and… the word just won't come. It’s not all the time, but it's happening more often than usual, I think. I don’t really remember when it started, to be perfectly honest. Everything feels a bit… hazy.
DOCTOR: Okay, so some increasing forgetfulness and difficulty finding words, and a general feeling of haziness. And you said it’s been happening more frequently. Have you noticed any changes in your vision, headaches, weakness, or trouble with balance?
PATIENT: No, not that I’ve noticed. My vision seems alright, I think. No headaches, thankfully. And no weakness or trouble with balancing… no. I’m a construction manager, you see, so I’m up and down ladders and walking around sites all day. If I had trouble balancing, I’d definitely know! I haven’t fallen or anything. It’s just… the words and the forgetting, mostly. It’s just a little unsettling, really.
DOCTOR: Alright, that's good to know about your work - it gives me a good baseline for your physical abilities. And I understand why it's unsettling. Let’s talk about your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s… a tricky question. Honestly, I don’t really remember. I mean, I’ve been to doctors before, of course, but I don’t have a good memory for… things like diagnoses. I have Medicare, so I’ve definitely seen doctors… I think. I’m married, and my husband usually handles all of that paperwork. I'm sorry, I wish I could be more helpful. Would it be possible to check with him, perhaps? He’d know much better than I would.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Adyn. It’s very common for patients to not remember specific diagnoses, and it’s good your husband is involved in your healthcare. We can certainly check your records, and I'll also ask some further questions. Let’s start with any past surgeries you may have had. Have you ever had any operations?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I don’t believe so. I mean, I haven't had anything major, that I recall. I had my wisdom teeth out when I was younger, I think… but that was so long ago. Nothing else comes to mind. I don’t think I've ever been in the hospital for anything, either. Honestly, I'm usually quite healthy. I’ve always been a busy person, running around on construction sites. I don’t really have time to be in the hospital!
DOCTOR: Okay, wisdom teeth removal is good to know. And you've been generally healthy. Now, let's talk about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, stroke, diabetes, or memory problems?
PATIENT: That’s another tricky one, Doctor. My family… we don’t really talk about medical things much. My mother passed away a few years ago, and I don’t recall what she died from, specifically. I know she had some… aches and pains in her later years, but beyond that… I have a brother, but we aren’t very close, and I haven’t spoken to him in a while. I honestly wouldn't know what runs in the family, I'm sorry. It feels like I'm not being very helpful at all.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Adyn. Family history can be difficult to recall, and it’s not your fault. We’ll work with what we have. Let's switch gears a bit. What about your social history?
PATIENT: Social history? What do you mean by that, Doctor? I’m married, as I said, and I work on construction sites… is that what you mean? I don’t really have a lot of hobbies, I just… work. I haven't got much time for anything else. I used to enjoy gardening, but I haven't done that in ages. Is there something specific you’re asking about? I'm just not quite sure what you need to know.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's perfectly alright. By social history, I mean things like whether you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs. It also includes information about your living situation and support system. So, do you currently smoke?
PATIENT: Oh, no, absolutely not. Never have, never will. Smoking is terrible for you, and I need my lungs for climbing ladders all day! No, I don’t smoke at all. And I don't really drink either. Perhaps a glass of wine on special occasions, but that’s very rare. My husband might have a beer sometimes, but I don’t. No recreational drugs, either. Definitely not. I need to stay sharp for work, you see.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to know. And no, I understand needing to stay sharp for work. Now, let's talk about allergies. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… Not that I'm aware of. I don't think so. I've never had a bad reaction to anything, as far as I can remember. No food allergies, no reaction to any medications… I mean, I don't take many medications regularly. Just the usual over-the-counter things when I have a cold or something. I don't think I've ever had an allergic reaction, thankfully. I seem to be pretty lucky, in that regard.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good. Now, let's talk about those medications you sometimes take for colds. Can you tell me the names of any medications you’ve used recently, even over-the-counter ones?
PATIENT: Oh dear… that's a difficult one. I usually just grab whatever my husband has in the medicine cabinet when I'm feeling unwell. I think there was… something for the cough? And maybe something for the headache, with… acetaminophen, I think? I really don’t pay much attention to the names, to be honest. I just read the label to make sure it’s for a cold, and then take it. It all feels a bit blurry, Doctor. I'm terribly sorry I can’t be more specific. I’m not very good with these things.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's alright, Adyn. It sounds like you take occasional over-the-counter medications for cold symptoms, including something with acetaminophen. It’s good you are careful to read the labels. Now, to help me get a better understanding of what’s going on, I'd like to do a brief physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that's perfectly alright, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgement. I just want to figure out what's going on, and if there’s anything I need to be worried about. So, yes, please. Go ahead.
DOCTOR: Okay. I'm going to start with a basic neurological exam. I'll check your reflexes, your balance, and your coordination. First, can you tell me today's date?
PATIENT: Oh… um… Today’s date… is it…? I… I know it's August, but the day… I think it’s the 2nd? Yes, the 2nd… of August… 2025? I think so. I'm so sorry, it’s just… everything feels a bit fuzzy. Is that correct?
DOCTOR: Okay, that's alright. You're close; today is August 2nd, 2025. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes. Please relax your arms. Okay, reflexes are 2+ bilaterally in the upper and lower extremities, which is normal. Now, I’m going to check your balance. Could you please stand up and walk a few steps for me?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Here we go… How is that? I feel a bit… off balance, to be honest. Not terribly, but… not quite right. It’s probably just nerves, though. I’m usually much steadier on my feet.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see what you mean. Your gait is slightly unsteady, and there’s a mild balance deficit. Okay, and with the Romberg test – which is standing with your feet together and eyes closed – you did exhibit a slight sway. That’s something we’ll want to investigate further. Finally, I’m going to check your cranial nerves. I’m going to ask you to follow my finger with your eyes without moving your head. Cranial nerves are intact. No nystagmus, pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light and accommodation. No facial drooping. Based on this brief examination, you have some mild balance issues and some memory concerns. To get a clearer picture of what’s going on, I’d like to order a few tests. Would you be willing to get a complete blood count and a thyroid panel?
PATIENT: Yes, absolutely, Doctor. Whatever tests you think are necessary. A complete blood count and a thyroid panel… yes, that sounds good. If it helps figure out what’s happening, then please, go ahead. I just want to feel normal again, you see. When will I know the results? And… is it something serious?
DOCTOR: Okay. The lab work should be back within a few business days, usually 3-5 days. We'll call you as soon as we have them. As for whether it's serious… it's too early to say definitively. These tests will help us rule out some potential causes for your symptoms. In the meantime, I’d also like to schedule an MRI of your brain, just to get a more detailed look. It's a precautionary measure, but it can give us a lot of valuable information. It's best to rule things out, if we can. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: An MRI… An MRI of my brain? Is… is that something to be worried about? I've never had an MRI before. Is it… painful? Will it show something bad? I just… I don’t want to think about anything being seriously wrong. I'm sorry, I'm probably being silly, but I'm a little frightened.
DOCTOR: It's not silly at all, Adyn. It's perfectly normal to feel anxious about an MRI, especially if you've never had one before. It’s a very common feeling. An MRI uses magnets and radio waves to create detailed images of your brain. It doesn't use any radiation, and it’s not painful. You’ll lie inside a large tube, and it can be a little noisy, so we’ll give you earplugs. It can feel a bit claustrophobic for some people, but the technicians are very good at making you comfortable, and you can stop the scan at any time if you feel uncomfortable. We're not looking for anything bad necessarily. It’s just a tool to help us get more information and rule out potential causes for your symptoms. Things like small strokes, tumors, or other structural issues. But again, that doesn't mean we expect to find anything. It's a precautionary measure. Would you like me to explain the procedure in more detail?
PATIENT: Yes, please. More detail would be helpful. Just… tell me exactly what will happen, step by step. And how long will it take? And… will I need someone to drive me? My husband usually takes me to appointments, but he’s working… I just want to be prepared, you see. The idea of being inside a tube… it makes me a little uneasy. Knowing what to expect would make me feel a lot better.
DOCTOR: Okay, absolutely. Here’s what will happen. First, you’ll be asked to change into a gown. You’ll need to remove any metal objects – jewelry, watches, hairpins, even underwire bras – because metal interferes with the MRI. We’ll give you a secure locker for your belongings. Then, you’ll lie down on a table that slides into the MRI machine. The machine is a large, cylindrical tube. We’ll give you a pillow and a blanket to make you comfortable. You’ll also have earplugs or headphones to block out the noise. During the scan, you’ll need to lie very still. It’s important not to move, because any movement can blur the images. The machine makes a loud knocking or buzzing sound. The scan itself usually takes about 30-60 minutes, depending on what areas of the brain we’re looking at. There’s a speaker in the room so you can communicate with the technician at any time. They’ll be monitoring you throughout the scan. Because we may use a mild sedative to help you relax, you will need someone to drive you home after the scan. It’s not safe to drive yourself. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Yes, that makes much more sense, thank you. The part about needing someone to drive me… that’s good to know. I’ll have to ask my husband to rearrange his schedule. And about the sedative… is that something I have to have? I don't really like taking medication if I can avoid it. I'm just a little worried about feeling… groggy. I have things to do, you see.
DOCTOR: That's a fair question. The sedative isn't required, but it's often recommended for patients who are anxious about MRIs, or who have trouble lying still. It helps you relax and makes the scan more comfortable. If you’re comfortable with it, we can certainly try the scan without a sedative. We can take things slowly, and the technician will be there to guide you through the process. If you start to feel anxious or claustrophobic, we can always stop the scan and reschedule it. We can also try some relaxation techniques before the scan, like deep breathing exercises, to help you feel more calm. What would you prefer?
PATIENT: Hmm… I think… I think I’d like to try it without the sedative, if possible. I don't really want to take medication if I can avoid it. But… if I start to feel really anxious, can we stop at any time? And will the technician be able to talk to me during the scan? Knowing I can communicate with someone would make me feel a lot better.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. You can absolutely stop at any time if you start to feel uncomfortable. And yes, the technician will be able to talk to you throughout the scan. They'll be monitoring you closely and will be able to answer any questions you have. They use a two-way communication system so you can talk to them, and they can talk to you without interrupting the scan. Okay, so we'll schedule an MRI of your brain without a sedative. We'll make sure to inform the technician about your anxiety so they can provide extra support during the scan. Before we finish, do you have any other questions for me?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. You've explained everything so thoroughly, Doctor, I really appreciate it. I’m still a little nervous, but I feel much better knowing what to expect. Thank you for being so patient with me, and for taking the time to answer all my questions. When will I hear about scheduling the MRI?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Adyn. I understand it's a little unnerving, and I'm glad I could ease some of your concerns. The scheduling department will call you within the next 24-48 hours to arrange a time for the MRI. They’ll also let you know what to expect on the day of the scan, and any other instructions you need to follow. In the meantime, if you have any questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to call the clinic. Here’s a summary of what we discussed today: You presented with increasing forgetfulness and difficulty finding words. We’ve ordered a complete blood count and a thyroid panel, and we’re scheduling an MRI of your brain to rule out any structural issues. We'll review the results as soon as they come in and discuss the next steps. Do you have any other concerns before we finish?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you again, Doctor. You’ve been very helpful. I’ll wait for the call about scheduling the MRI. Have a good day.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Adyn. It was my pleasure. Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions. Have a good day as well. We’ll be in touch soon. .
