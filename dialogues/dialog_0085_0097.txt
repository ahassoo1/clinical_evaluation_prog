DOCTOR: Good morning, Marija. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Lahn. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… adequate to meet you as well. I understand you have the forms I require regarding… end-of-life planning. My husband and I have been discussing it, and frankly, it’s rather… unsettling to leave things undefined. I believe you call them an Advance Directive or a POLST form? I simply want to ensure my wishes are very clear, should anything… unfortunate occur.
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely. Those are very important forms to have completed, and it’s incredibly responsible of you and your husband to be thinking about this now. It is unsettling, you’re right, but also empowering to have those conversations and put your wishes in writing. We can certainly go through both Advance Directives – which cover a broader range of situations – and the POLST form, which is more specific for serious illness. To start, can you tell me a little bit about your overall health?
PATIENT: Overall health? Well, I maintain a… respectable lifestyle. I teach, you know. Foreign Languages and Literature. It requires a certain… discipline. I don’t have any major ailments, though I do occasionally suffer from… headaches. Stress, naturally. And my knees aren't what they used to be. Being rather tall, you see, puts a strain on things. Otherwise, I consider myself quite… robust. Do you require a detailed medical history? I haven't been to a doctor in some time, truthfully.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear you're generally robust, and teaching certainly does require discipline! A detailed history would be helpful, yes, just to get a good baseline. We can take it slowly. Let’s start with past medical problems. Have you ever been diagnosed with any chronic conditions like high blood pressure, diabetes, heart disease, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, nothing of the sort. I assure you, Doctor, I've always been quite… meticulous about my well-being. My mother always said I had a… constitution of steel. She was Moroccan, you know. Very… strong people. I’ve never needed to take regular medication, aside from the occasional pain reliever for… minor discomfort. And truthfully, I avoid doctors when possible. They always seem to want to… overcomplicate things.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent to hear. A strong constitution is a wonderful thing, and it sounds like you’ve been very proactive about your health. I understand your hesitation with doctors, and I assure you, my goal is to keep things as straightforward as possible. We'll only explore what's necessary. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No, never. Not a single surgery. I consider it… barbaric to willingly allow someone to cut into one’s body. And hospitalization? Absolutely not. I manage things at home. My husband is quite capable, and I… prefer the comfort of my own surroundings. A hospital is… unsettling, filled with… germs and negativity. It simply isn't conducive to… recuperation.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. It's perfectly reasonable to prefer the comfort of home when recovering, and many people feel the same way about hospitals. Let's talk about your family history, if you don't mind. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, cancer, diabetes, or neurological disorders?
PATIENT: Family history… hmm. My mother’s side was… remarkably healthy, all things considered. She came from a small village in Morocco, and they lived a very… simple life. Lots of fresh air, wholesome food. Very little in the way of… modern ailments. My father’s side… well, he was English. And they were… rather prone to… complaining. He mentioned his father had a weak heart, I believe. And an aunt who suffered from… nerves. But frankly, I don’t place much stock in family history. People exaggerate, you know. And it’s often just… bad luck. Is this truly relevant, Doctor? I simply want to complete these forms, not provide a genealogical record.
DOCTOR: I understand your skepticism. Family history can sometimes be unreliable, but it can also offer clues, so I always ask. Weak heart on your father's side is good to know. Now, let's talk a little bit about your current lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Good heavens, no! Absolutely not. I find such habits… distasteful. Smoking is… barbaric. Alcohol… simply clouds the mind. And recreational drugs? Unthinkable! I maintain a… very respectable lifestyle, as I mentioned. I enjoy reading, teaching, and spending time with my husband. We are… intellectuals. We prefer stimulating conversation to… base pleasures. I assure you, Doctor, my life is quite… ordered. Do you find my answers… unsatisfactory? I am attempting to provide you with the information you require, but I must say, these questions feel… rather intrusive.
DOCTOR: No, not at all, Marija. Your answers are perfectly satisfactory. I apologize if the questions feel intrusive; I'm simply trying to get a complete picture of your overall health. It sounds like you lead a very healthy and fulfilling life, and that's wonderful. Just a few more questions, and then we can start discussing the Advance Directive and POLST form. Have you had any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. None whatsoever. I have always been remarkably resilient. I recall a childhood mishap with a rather prickly plant, but that was hardly an allergy. My husband once attempted to give me… shellfish. It was quite unpleasant, but not an allergic reaction, merely a… dislike of the texture. I assure you, Doctor, I am not prone to… sensitivities. I can tolerate most things, within reason, of course. Is this truly necessary? I feel as though we are straying from the purpose of this visit. I simply wish to complete these forms and be done with it.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Marija. You are right, we should focus on the Advance Directive and POLST form. No allergies is good to know. One last question, then. Are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No. Absolutely not. I pride myself on maintaining my health without the need for artificial intervention. I find medication… unsettling. All those chemicals… interfering with the body's natural processes. I might occasionally take an aspirin for a headache, but that is hardly… regular medication. And supplements? Good heavens, no. I obtain all the nutrients I require from a… sensible diet. I assure you, Doctor, I am not reliant on any… external substances. Now, shall we please proceed with the forms? I am beginning to feel… rather impatient.
DOCTOR: Of course, Marija. I apologize for the extensive questions; I just wanted to ensure I had a complete understanding of your health. It's very clear you prioritize a natural and healthy lifestyle, and that's admirable. Let's talk about the Advance Directive first. This document allows you to appoint someone to make healthcare decisions for you if you are unable to make them yourself, and it outlines your wishes regarding medical treatment. Have you given any thought to who you would want to be your healthcare proxy?
PATIENT: Yes, naturally. My husband, Edward. He is… quite capable and possesses a… logical mind. He understands my wishes perfectly. We have discussed it at length. He is a retired professor of… Classical Literature, so he is accustomed to… reasoned thought. I trust him implicitly to make the appropriate decisions, should the need arise. Though I sincerely hope it never does. This is… rather morbid, don't you think? To discuss one's own… incapacitation. But, as I said, it's important to be… prepared. Now, what exactly does this… document entail? Is it a lengthy process? I have a luncheon engagement this afternoon, you see.
DOCTOR: Edward sounds like an excellent choice. It’s wonderful that you’ve already discussed this with him. The Advance Directive is a fairly standard document, outlining your preferences for things like life-sustaining treatment, pain management, and end-of-life care. It’s not overly lengthy, and we can go through it section by section. It will probably take about 30-45 minutes to complete, and I'll be here to answer any questions you have. Before we begin, are you familiar with the difference between a living will and a durable power of attorney for healthcare?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, no. I simply requested the forms. I do not possess a… comprehensive understanding of legal terminology. My husband handles those sorts of things. A living will… is that related to inheritance? And a durable power of attorney… sounds rather… bureaucratic. I simply want to ensure my wishes are… respected. I do not wish to be kept alive artificially, should there be no hope of recovery. And I certainly do not wish to be subjected to… prolonged suffering. Is that adequately clear? Perhaps you could simply explain the forms in… layman's terms? I find legal jargon… rather bewildering. And frankly, I’m beginning to feel… quite fatigued. This is proving to be… more taxing than I anticipated.
DOCTOR: Of course, Marija. I apologize for using terminology that’s not helpful. Let’s forget about “living wills” and “durable power of attorney” for now. The most important thing is that you’ve clearly stated your wishes – you don’t want to be kept alive artificially without hope of recovery, and you want to avoid prolonged suffering. The Advance Directive will allow us to document those wishes, and it will also name Edward as your healthcare proxy – the person who will make medical decisions for you if you’re unable to. It’s essentially a way to ensure your voice is heard, even when you can’t speak for yourself. The form has sections on things like resuscitation, mechanical ventilation, and artificial nutrition. We can go through each section slowly, and you can tell me your preferences. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… marginally better. To be clear, Edward should always prioritize my… comfort. And I do not wish to be subjected to any… heroic measures. Prolonging the inevitable is simply… undignified. I’ve always believed in accepting one’s fate with… grace. Resuscitation… I suppose if my heart simply… stops, there is little point in attempting to restart it. Mechanical ventilation… that sounds… unpleasant. And artificial nutrition… I prefer natural sustenance. Is there a section on… pain management? That is rather important. I do not wish to suffer needlessly. And please, Doctor, do not attempt to… persuade me. I have already made up my mind. I simply want to complete the forms and be… done with it.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Marija. Your wishes are very clear, and I will document everything accordingly. Edward will be instructed to prioritize your comfort above all else, and no heroic measures will be taken. We'll focus on ensuring you are comfortable and pain-free. There is a section on pain management, and we can specify your preferences for medication and other comfort measures. Let's start with the resuscitation section. It asks whether you want cardiopulmonary resuscitation if your heart stops beating or you stop breathing. Given your wishes, would you like us to indicate "do not resuscitate" ?
PATIENT: Yes, absolutely. Do not resuscitate. There is simply no point. I have lived a… full life. And I do not wish to be subjected to… violent interventions in my final moments. It sounds… barbaric, frankly. I prefer a… peaceful transition. Please, Doctor, make a clear notation. Do not resuscitate. And please, ensure Edward understands this… unequivocally. I trust him, but he can be… rather meticulous about details. He might question the… rationale, should he feel it is… insufficient. Now, what is the next… unpleasantness? I trust this will not take much longer. I have a rather important luncheon engagement, you see.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Marija. It's marked very clearly. Now, let’s move on to mechanical ventilation. This refers to using a machine to help you breathe if you’re unable to breathe on your own. Do you have any preferences regarding mechanical ventilation?
PATIENT: No. Absolutely not. I do not wish to be… tethered to a machine. It sounds… undignified. I prefer to… breathe naturally, for as long as possible. Should my lungs simply… fail, then… so be it. I do not wish to prolong the process artificially. It’s… unsettling, frankly. Please, make a clear notation. No mechanical ventilation. And please, ensure Edward understands this as well. He might question the… necessity, should he believe it would… offer some benefit. He is a… thorough man, you see. Now, what is the next… ordeal? I trust we are nearing the end of this… tedious process. My luncheon engagement is rapidly approaching.
DOCTOR: Yes, we are getting closer, Marija. Just a few more sections. Let’s talk about artificial nutrition. This refers to receiving nutrients and fluids through an IV or feeding tube if you’re unable to eat or drink on your own. Do you have any preferences regarding artificial nutrition?
PATIENT: No. Absolutely not. I prefer natural sustenance. I believe in… savoring food, enjoying the simple pleasures of life. Being… fed through a tube sounds… dehumanizing. I would rather… decline gracefully. Please, make a clear notation. No artificial nutrition. And please, ensure Edward understands this as well. He might question the… nutritional benefits, should he believe it would… prolong my life. He is a… pragmatic man, you see. Now, is there a section on pain management? That is rather important. I do not wish to suffer needlessly. I trust this is nearing completion. My luncheon engagement is… imminent.
DOCTOR: Yes, you are right to ask. There is a section on pain management, Marija. It asks about your preferences for medication and other comfort measures to alleviate pain and suffering. Would you like to specify any preferences at this time?
PATIENT: Yes, absolutely. I wish to be kept as comfortable as possible. I do not wish to suffer needlessly. I trust Edward to make the appropriate decisions, but I would prefer… morphine, if necessary. A… generous dose, should the pain be… unbearable. And I wish to be kept… sedated, should the situation warrant it. I do not wish to be… conscious during my final moments, should they be… prolonged. Please, make a clear notation. Morphine, if necessary, and sedation, if warranted. And please, ensure Edward understands this… unequivocally. He might question the… side effects, should he believe it would… impair my cognitive function. He is a… meticulous man, you see. Now, is this… finally the end of this… tedious process? My luncheon engagement is… rapidly approaching.
DOCTOR: Yes, Marija, this is it. We've completed the Advance Directive. I’ve documented everything we discussed, including your preferences for resuscitation, mechanical ventilation, artificial nutrition, and pain management. I’ve also noted Edward’s role as your healthcare proxy and his understanding of your wishes. Would you like me to make a copy of this document for you and Edward?
PATIENT: Yes, please. A copy for both of us would be… adequate. And please, ensure it is… clearly legible. Edward has… particular standards when it comes to documentation. And please, tell me, Doctor, will this… document be legally binding? I simply want to ensure my wishes are… respected. And please, do not attempt to… persuade me to reconsider anything. I have made up my mind. Now, if you will excuse me, I must… prepare for my luncheon engagement. It is… rapidly approaching. Thank you for your… assistance. Though I must say, this has been… rather taxing.
DOCTOR: Of course, Marija. Here are two copies, clearly legible as requested. And yes, this document is legally binding, provided it is properly executed with a witness signature. I will have my medical assistant ensure that is taken care of before you leave. I understand this has been taxing, and I appreciate your patience and willingness to discuss these important matters. Do you have any other questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I believe that is… adequate. Edward will likely have… questions, but I shall defer to him. I simply wanted to ensure my wishes were… documented. Thank you for your… assistance. Now, if you will excuse me, I must… depart. My luncheon engagement is… imminent. Good day.
