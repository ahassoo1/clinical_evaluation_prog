DOCTOR: Alright, Nykisha, good to see you. Though frankly, people come in for everything these days. So, tell me… what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, thank you, Doctor Osterholm. It’s… it’s my skin, mostly. It’s been getting darker, and I’m just… really tired all the time. It’s not like a normal tired, you know? It’s hard to explain.
DOCTOR: Darker skin… and fatigue. Right. It is hard to explain, I suppose. People and their vague complaints. Okay. Let’s start with the skin. Where is it getting darker?
PATIENT: Oh, everywhere, really. But it started on my hands and feet, I think. And now… well, if I look in the mirror, it just looks… different. Not like a tan, more… brownish, maybe? It’s hard to say. I haven’t been out in the sun any more than usual, that's for sure.
DOCTOR: "Everywhere" is… unhelpful, Nykisha. Is it itchy?
PATIENT: No, not itchy at all. That’s what’s so strange. It doesn’t feel different, just… looks different. It’s not like a rash or anything. It's just... a change in color. And it’s been happening slowly, over the last few months, I guess. It's hard to pinpoint exactly when it started.
DOCTOR: Slowly… months. Okay. And you said you’re tired… how long has that been going on?
PATIENT: Oh, the tiredness… probably around the same time as the skin, maybe a little longer. It’s not just being sleepy, though. It's like… everything takes so much effort. Even getting out of bed in the morning. And I feel weak, sometimes. Like I could just… collapse. But I haven’t, yet!
DOCTOR: "Collapse"?
PATIENT: Well, not literally collapse. It’s just… a feeling. Like my legs are going to give out, you know? And sometimes my heart feels… fluttery. Not all the time, but enough to notice it. It's just… a lot of little things, all adding up. And I haven’t been doing anything different, I swear. Same routine, same diet… maybe a little more stressed lately with… things. But nothing major.
DOCTOR: "Things." Wonderful. Okay. Let’s try to get a little more specific. Do you have any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I’ve been a little more thirsty than usual, maybe? And I go to the bathroom a lot more often, especially at night. I thought it was just… getting older, you know? But now that you ask… maybe it is more than that. Oh! And I’ve been getting headaches, sort of dull ones, behind my eyes. They come and go.
DOCTOR: Headaches, increased thirst, frequent urination… Okay. Now, have you noticed any changes in your appetite?
PATIENT: Not really. I eat about the same as always. Maybe a little less, now that I think about it. But that could be just because I'm so tired, you know? I don't really feel hungry a lot of the time. It's hard to explain. It's just… everything feels off. And it’s worrying me, because I don’t know what’s going on.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's go through some medical history. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I haven’t really taken much medicine in my life, to be honest. Just… pain relievers for headaches, sometimes. And I had a tetanus shot a few years ago, when I cut my hand gardening. But no bad reactions to anything, ever. My mother had… high blood pressure, I think. And my father… he had problems with his stomach, but I don't know what exactly. They both lived in Cambodia, you know. It was different there.
DOCTOR: Right. And have you ever had any serious illnesses or surgeries?
PATIENT: No, nothing major. I had my tonsils out when I was a kid, a long time ago. And I broke my arm once, when I was little. But that's it. I've been pretty healthy, all my life. Until now, of course. It’s just… this is so strange. I feel like something is really wrong. And I’m worried it’s something serious.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's do a quick physical exam, just to get a better look at things. I need to check your blood pressure, pulse, and listen to your heart and lungs. And I'll take a look at your skin, more closely. Please sit back and relax.
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds good. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just want to figure out what’s going on. It’s been worrying me a lot.
DOCTOR: 140 over 90… Hmm. Slightly elevated. Pulse is 88, regular. Lungs are clear. Heart sounds… unremarkable. The skin… brownish discoloration, as the patient stated. No rashes, no lesions, no swelling. Not itchy, as the patient stated. Skin exam: Brownish discoloration of hands and feet, bilateral. No acute findings. Now, let’s check your reflexes.
PATIENT: Okay. That felt a little… sharp. Is everything okay?
DOCTOR: Reflexes are… normal. A little brisk, perhaps, but nothing concerning. Now, I’m going to order some blood work. Just a routine CBC, CMP, and a TSH. We’ll also check your A1C, just to rule things out. It'll give us a better idea of what's going on. The lab should be able to get the results back in a few days. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: Oh… blood work. Okay. CBC, CMP… A1C… I don't even know what those are, to be honest. Is it something serious? And how long will it take to get the results? A few days… what does that mean exactly? I just… I'm worried. What are you looking for? Is it something I did?
DOCTOR: Look, Nykisha, it's routine. These tests check basic things - your blood count, your kidney and liver function, your thyroid, your blood sugar. It doesn't mean anything is seriously wrong. We just need a baseline. As for how long... "a few days" means the lab needs to process it, the results need to be sent, and then I need to review them. It usually takes three to five business days, but it depends on the lab. And no, it's not something you did. It’s probably just… stress. Or getting older. Now, I'm going to write you a requisition form for the lab. It's across the street, at the clinic. You can go whenever you’re ready. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Okay… three to five days. Across the street. Stress… getting older… So, you don’t think it’s anything serious? Like… cancer, or something? My aunt… she had cancer, you know. And she had fatigue, and skin problems…
DOCTOR: Look, Nykisha, I understand you’re worried, but jumping to conclusions isn’t helpful. It’s highly unlikely to be cancer based on what you’ve told me. But we need to rule things out. That’s why we're doing the tests. Honestly, the fatigue is likely due to stress, and the skin discoloration could be a number of things. Let’s get the results first, then we can talk about it rationally. I don’t want to cause unnecessary alarm. Now, are you able to go to the lab and get this done?
PATIENT: Yes… yes, I can go. Across the street, you said? I’ll… I’ll go right after this. I just… I’m so worried. Thank you, Doctor. For… for doing the tests. I hope it’s nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Yes, well… go get it done. And try to relax. I'll call you with the results in a few days. Don't hesitate to call if anything changes drastically. .
PATIENT: .
