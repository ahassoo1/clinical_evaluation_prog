DOCTOR: Good morning, Gabbrielle. My name is Dr. Andraca. It's nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… fine. I suppose. It’s this discoloration on my skin. It’s rather bothersome, and frankly, I don’t understand how it even started. I’ve always been very careful.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Discoloration can be concerning, and it's good you're getting it checked out. “Rather bothersome” is helpful – can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Well, it’s not… aesthetically pleasing, naturally. It’s just… not right. It’s on my hands, mostly. And a bit on my arms. It’s not a rash, it’s more like… patches. Uneven coloring. It’s difficult to explain. I keep thinking I haven't washed my hands properly, but that’s ridiculous. I'm very meticulous.
DOCTOR: I see. Patches of uneven coloring on your hands and arms. And you're meticulous about hygiene, so you've ruled out a lot of common causes already. When did you first notice these patches?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… it was… sometime in late March, I believe. Yes, March 23rd, actually. I remember because it was the day Mrs. Hrabovsky’s prize-winning begonias were stolen. Such a tragedy. Anyway, I noticed it while I was cataloging some old photographs. It was very faint then, barely noticeable. Now, it’s… more pronounced. It's definitely getting worse.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it started around March 23rd and has been gradually worsening since then. And it’s primarily on your hands and arms?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s correct. Mostly there. Though… now that you mention it, I think there’s a tiny spot starting on my neck. Just a small one, really. But yes, hands and arms, and now… a little on my neck. It’s quite irritating, honestly. I’ve tried lotions, of course. Several. None of them have made a difference. Expensive ones, too.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it's progressing, and now includes a small spot on your neck as well. And lotions haven’t been effective. Has anything else changed around the time you noticed the discoloration?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. Let me think… no, not really. My routine is very… stable. I haven’t traveled, haven’t started any new cleaning products… oh! Actually, yes. My husband, Bohdan, he started using a new shaving cream. A sandalwood one. Quite strong smelling, if I recall. He keeps the bathroom quite well-ventilated, though. But perhaps… could that have something to do with it? It seems rather far-fetched.
DOCTOR: That’s good information, thank you. It doesn’t seem likely, but we need to consider everything. Do you recall if you came into contact with the shaving cream directly, or if the bathroom ventilation seemed to be affecting you when he was shaving?
PATIENT: Well, I certainly didn’t use the shaving cream! Bohdan knows better than to offer me his toiletries. And the ventilation is adequate, I suppose. But… I do sometimes enter the bathroom right after he shaves, to tidy up. The scent lingers, naturally. It’s a very… pervasive fragrance. I wouldn’t say it irritates me, per se, but it's… strong. And I do have a rather sensitive constitution, you understand.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you're exposed to the scent of the new shaving cream after he shaves, and you consider yourself to have a sensitive constitution. Let's move on to some other questions then. Have you noticed any itching, burning, or pain associated with these patches?
PATIENT: No, no itching, burning, or pain. That’s why it’s so perplexing. It’s purely… visual. Unpleasant, but not physically uncomfortable. I wouldn't even know it was there if I didn't see it. It’s just… wrong. And it's spreading, of course. It makes me rather anxious, if I'm being honest. I’ve always taken very good care of myself.
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety, Gabbrielle, and it's good you're taking this seriously. Okay, so no associated symptoms like itching, burning, or pain, just the discoloration and progression. Now, I'd like to ask about your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, like eczema, psoriasis, or any autoimmune disorders?
PATIENT: No, nothing of the sort. I've always been remarkably healthy, actually. My mother always said I had a constitution of iron. I have my regular check-ups, of course, but the doctors always tell me I'm in excellent condition. I take a daily vitamin, and I eat a very balanced diet. Bohdan fusses over that, you see. He's very particular. I haven't even had a significant cold in years. This… this is entirely new. And rather upsetting.
DOCTOR: That's good to know. No past medical history of skin conditions or other relevant issues. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No, absolutely not. I’ve always been very careful to avoid unnecessary medical interventions. Bohdan would be beside himself if I even suggested such a thing. A minor tonsillectomy when I was a child, but that was… decades ago. A very routine procedure. Other than that, nothing. I pride myself on my good health. This discoloration… it’s a complete anomaly. I'm beginning to suspect some sort of… environmental factor. Perhaps something in the water? Or the air?
DOCTOR: Okay, no significant surgical history. Let’s talk about your family history. Do any of your close relatives – parents, siblings, grandparents – have any skin conditions, autoimmune disorders, or other medical issues?
PATIENT: Well, my mother had… a touch of rosacea, I suppose. Nothing serious, just a bit of redness on her cheeks. She managed it with creams, mostly. My father was a very robust man, always outdoors. He didn’t have any particular ailments, as far as I know. My grandmother… she had arthritis, later in life. Very painful, I remember. But nothing related to the skin. No autoimmune disorders, either. We're a rather… healthy family, generally speaking. This is what’s so baffling. It simply doesn't fit.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a little rosacea in your mother and arthritis in your grandmother, but no significant history of skin conditions or autoimmune disorders. Now, a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Goodness, no! Absolutely not. Bohdan would never allow it. He’s very health-conscious, as I’ve mentioned. And I certainly wouldn’t dream of indulging in such habits. It’s simply… uncivilized. We enjoy a nice cup of herbal tea in the evenings, and a walk in the garden, weather permitting. A very wholesome lifestyle, you see. No, no smoking or drinking for me. This discoloration is all the more… disconcerting, given my impeccable habits.
DOCTOR: Okay, very wholesome lifestyle, no smoking or alcohol. And finally, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies that I'm aware of. I've never had a reaction to anything. Bohdan is very careful about what we eat, ensures everything is fresh and organic. I occasionally have a mild sensitivity to strong perfumes, but that’s just a slight sniffle, nothing serious. No, no allergies to speak of. Honestly, Doctor, I'm at a loss. I take such pride in my health and wellbeing. This is… deeply troubling. I’ve catalogued everything, and I still can’t find a reason for this.
DOCTOR: Okay, Gabbrielle, thank you for sharing all of that information with me. It sounds like you've been very diligent about your health. Let's move on to a physical exam now. I’m going to take a closer look at these patches on your hands, arms, and neck. Please let me know if anything is uncomfortable. I see the discoloration is somewhat irregular in shape, and the color is a slightly lighter shade than your natural skin tone. The skin texture feels normal, and there’s no redness or swelling. It doesn’t appear to be raised or scaly. I don't notice any broken skin or open sores. I also don't see any discoloration elsewhere on your body.
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds about right. Irregular, lighter… it's quite subtle, really, unless you're looking for it. I did notice it seemed… more prominent after I spent a bit of time gardening last week. But I always wear gloves! Perhaps they weren’t thick enough? It’s all very… perplexing. I do hope you can determine the cause of this, Doctor. It's rather unnerving to have something… unknown… happening to my skin.
DOCTOR: Okay, the fact that it seems more prominent after gardening is interesting. It could suggest some sort of sensitivity to sunlight or something in the soil, despite the gloves. To help narrow down the possibilities, I’d like to order a few blood tests. These will help rule out any underlying medical conditions and check for inflammation. I'm also going to recommend a skin biopsy, just to get a definitive diagnosis. It’s a simple procedure where we take a small sample of the affected skin and send it to a lab for analysis. Would you be comfortable with those tests?
PATIENT: Blood tests and a… biopsy? Oh, dear. A biopsy sounds… rather invasive, doesn't it? Is it absolutely necessary? I do understand you need to be thorough, but I confess I’m not fond of needles or… samples being taken. Couldn’t we try something else first? Perhaps a different cream? Or an allergy test? A biopsy seems… a bit extreme, given how subtle this discoloration is.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Gabbrielle. A biopsy does sound more involved than a cream, and it's perfectly reasonable to feel apprehensive. However, given that we’ve ruled out many of the common causes and haven’t yet reached a definitive answer, a biopsy is the most reliable way to determine what’s causing the discoloration. It will help us avoid unnecessary treatments and ensure you receive the right care. The biopsy is a very minor procedure. We’ll numb the area first, so you won’t feel any pain. It only takes a few minutes, and the sample is sent to a specialized lab for analysis. I want to assure you that I wouldn't recommend it if it wasn't medically necessary. We can discuss the risks and benefits in more detail, and if you're still uncomfortable, we can explore other options, like allergy testing, as you suggested. However, it’s important to remember that allergy testing may not always be accurate, and it could delay a diagnosis. What are your thoughts?
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. If you believe it's absolutely necessary… I suppose I have no choice. But please, be gentle. I truly dislike needles. And I do hope the lab is… reputable. I wouldn’t want any mistakes. And what if it's something… serious? Is that a possibility? You haven’t said much about potential causes. I prefer to be fully informed, you understand. Don’t sugarcoat anything. I can handle the truth, however unpleasant. Just… tell me what we’re looking for, exactly. And what the potential outcomes might be.
DOCTOR: You are right to ask, Gabbrielle. I apologize if I haven’t been clear enough. It's important you feel fully informed. The blood tests will help us rule out underlying conditions like autoimmune disorders or vitamin deficiencies that can sometimes cause skin changes. The biopsy will allow us to examine the skin cells under a microscope and identify the exact cause of the discoloration. Potential causes we’re considering include a fungal infection, a mild form of eczema, or a pigmentary disorder. It’s also possible it could be a reaction to something you’ve come into contact with, although we haven’t been able to identify it yet. The potential outcomes vary depending on the cause. Most of the conditions we’re considering are treatable with topical creams, medications, or lifestyle changes. In rare cases, it could be a sign of something more serious, but that is unlikely given your overall health and the subtle nature of the discoloration. The lab we use is highly reputable and certified. I will personally review the results and discuss them with you in detail. I will also explain all treatment options if necessary. The biopsy itself is a quick procedure. We’ll numb the area with a local anesthetic, and then take a small sample of skin using a specialized instrument. There may be some mild discomfort, but it should be brief. I will arrange for the tests to be scheduled as soon as possible. Do you have any other questions or concerns at this time?
PATIENT: No, I suppose not… for the moment. Just… please be as quick as possible. And ensure the area is properly bandaged afterwards. I don't want any infection. And could I have a written summary of the results, once they’re available? I like to keep detailed records, you see. It's important to have everything documented. Bohdan insists on it. Very well, Doctor. Let us proceed with the tests. But I trust you will keep me informed every step of the way. And please, be gentle with that needle. I truly dislike them. Now, what is the next step? When can I expect to have this… biopsy scheduled?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Gabbrielle. I understand your concerns and will do everything I can to make the process as comfortable as possible. I will personally ensure the area is properly bandaged afterwards to prevent any infection. And of course, you will receive a detailed written summary of the results, as Bohdan prefers. I will have my assistant schedule the biopsy for you right away. We can usually get it done within the next few days, depending on availability. I’ll also provide you with detailed instructions on how to prepare for the procedure and what to expect afterwards. My assistant will also coordinate with the lab to ensure your sample is handled with the utmost care. I will review the results as soon as they’re available and contact you to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, if you experience any concerning symptoms, like redness, swelling, or pain, please don’t hesitate to contact my office. Do you have any questions about the scheduling process or anything else before I have my assistant reach out to you?
PATIENT: No, I believe that is all for now, Doctor. Just… please tell your assistant to be as gentle as possible when scheduling. I do not like being rushed. And perhaps a morning appointment? I prefer to have it over with early in the day. Thank you for your time, Doctor. I appreciate your thoroughness, and I trust you will do your best to determine the cause of this… discoloration. Now, if you'll excuse me, I believe I should go. It’s been rather… draining, discussing all of this. .
DOCTOR: Certainly, Gabbrielle. I will personally let my assistant know about your preference for a morning appointment and to be mindful of your time. It’s perfectly understandable that this has been draining. We’ll get to the bottom of this, and I’ll do everything I can to make the process as smooth as possible. Please don’t hesitate to contact my office if you have any questions or concerns. Have a good day, and I look forward to seeing you soon. .
