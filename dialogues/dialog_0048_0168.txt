DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Pandolfi. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor Sink, it’s… a delicate matter, really. I’m seeing someone. A new gentleman. And I just want to be certain everything is as it should be before things… progress. One has to be careful, you know. Especially at my age. It’s not like when you’re a young girl and can just… recover.
DOCTOR: Right. “Progress.” Of course. It’s always something. And you're concerned about… sexually transmitted infections, I presume?
PATIENT: Precisely. Though, frankly, it’s not just that. I mean, one reads things. Horrible things. And I simply want the peace of mind of knowing I’m not… exposing myself to anything untoward. He says he’s been tested, but… well, you know men. They have a tendency to… embellish. I trust my instincts, and my instincts are telling me a thorough check is required.
DOCTOR: “Embellish,” yes. A common issue. And you want a full STI screening, then. And… anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. While we’re at it, I’ve been feeling… a bit run down lately. Not ill, precisely, but lacking my usual… vigor. Perhaps a general check-up would be wise? I do take my Medicare, of course, and I’d like to know if that covers everything. One doesn't want any unpleasant surprises with bills, you understand.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, STI screening, general check-up… Medicare should cover most of it, though there may be some co-pays depending on the specific tests. Let’s start with a history. Have you had any symptoms – any unusual discharge, sores, itching, burning during urination?
PATIENT: Absolutely not. I maintain a very… hygienic lifestyle, Doctor. And I am quite attuned to my body. Any deviation would be immediately noticed. No, nothing of the sort. It’s more of a… preventative measure. And to ensure he is being entirely truthful, naturally. I do find it rather… concerning that he hasn’t offered proof of his results, you know. A gentleman would readily provide that.
DOCTOR: Right. No symptoms. And he hasn't provided documentation. Very well. Let’s move on. Past medical history – any chronic conditions like diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease?
PATIENT: No, thankfully. My mother, bless her soul, had a touch of arthritis in her later years, but I’ve been quite fortunate in that regard. I watch my diet, I exercise regularly, and I maintain a positive outlook on life. I believe strongly in the power of preventative care, which is why I’m here, of course. I had a hysterectomy some years ago – around 2008, I believe – but otherwise, I’m in remarkably good health for my age.
DOCTOR: Hysterectomy in 2008… alright. Any surgeries other than the hysterectomy?
PATIENT: Let me see… I had my wisdom teeth removed in my early twenties, and a rather nasty bout of appendicitis required surgery when I was a teenager. Other than that, nothing significant. A few minor things, of course - a cyst removed from my arm, but nothing that would be relevant here, I’m sure. Really, I’ve been very lucky. And I intend to keep it that way. That's why I'm so diligent about my health.
DOCTOR: Family history?
PATIENT: Well, my father had high blood pressure, as did his father before him. My mother’s side was generally quite healthy, though her sister had a touch of… the diabetes, I believe. Not severe, but present nonetheless. Beyond that, nothing particularly alarming. We weren’t a family prone to… dramatic illnesses, if you catch my drift. More of the common ailments, really. Nothing that would require… special precautions, I trust.
DOCTOR: And social history?
PATIENT: Oh. Well. I’ve been married for… twenty-seven years now. Happily, I assure you. Though my husband and I… well, let’s just say our relationship is more companionable these days. We aren’t as… active, shall we say. Which is why I’ve… met someone new. I don’t smoke, I rarely drink – perhaps a glass of wine with dinner on occasion – and I do not partake in any… illicit activities. I am a woman of good standing, Doctor. And I expect a certain level of… discretion.
DOCTOR: Alright. Allergies?
PATIENT: No known allergies. I can eat anything, thankfully. Though I do find shellfish a bit…rich. But that's a matter of preference, not a medical concern. No reactions to medications, either. I’ve taken antibiotics as needed, of course, but nothing that caused any… complications. Really, I’m a remarkably simple case, Doctor. It’s rather refreshing, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: And are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Just a low-dose aspirin, as recommended by my previous physician for… preventative purposes. And a multivitamin, of course. One must maintain one’s health, you understand. Nothing else. Absolutely nothing else. I believe in being… proactive, not reactive, when it comes to my well-being. I don’t simply wait for something to go wrong, I take steps to ensure it doesn’t.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let’s do a quick physical exam then. I’ll need to check your blood pressure, pulse, and listen to your heart and lungs. And… a pelvic exam, given the circumstances. Do you have any objections?
PATIENT: Objections? Goodness, no. I understand the necessity. Though, if you don't mind, I'd prefer you explain everything as you go. I do appreciate being… informed. And, if possible, perhaps a slightly… warmer instrument? I've always found those things rather… chilling. I trust that’s not an unreasonable request? I simply wish to be comfortable, you understand.
DOCTOR: Alright. I can warm the speculum. Let's start with your blood pressure. 140 over 85. A bit elevated, but not alarming. Pulse is 78, regular. Now, let's listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are normal, lungs are clear. Now, we’ll need to proceed with the pelvic exam. Please lie on the examination table. I will explain each step as I go.
PATIENT: Very well. I appreciate your thoroughness, Doctor. And the explanation will certainly be… reassuring. One simply doesn't want any… surprises, you understand. Please proceed at your own pace. And do let me know if you require anything. A little reassurance goes a long way, you know.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’m going to insert the speculum now. It may feel a bit… uncomfortable, but it should be brief. Cervix appears normal. No obvious lesions or discharge. Now, I’ll do a bimanual exam. Uterus feels normal size. Ovaries are… slightly enlarged, but not acutely tender. We'll need to order some blood work to get a clearer picture. I’m going to order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a full STI screening panel. We’ll also get a urine analysis. Do you have any questions before we proceed?
PATIENT: Urine analysis, of course. One must be thorough. Slightly enlarged ovaries… that is concerning. Is it anything serious, Doctor? Should I be… alarmed? I do try to maintain a healthy lifestyle, as I mentioned, and I haven’t experienced any pain or discomfort. Perhaps it's simply a fluctuation? It would be rather… disruptive to my routine if something were seriously amiss. And what about the gentleman? Should he be tested as well? It seems only prudent, doesn't it?
DOCTOR: Slightly enlarged ovaries can be a number of things. It could be a cyst, hormonal fluctuations, or simply a normal variation. We need the blood work to rule out anything serious. It's unlikely to be anything acute, but we need to be thorough. And yes, he absolutely should be tested. I will provide him with a requisition form when you leave. It is his responsibility to follow through. We will review the results in a week. If you experience any pelvic pain, fever, or unusual discharge, contact the office immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Perfectly. A requisition form for the gentleman. I shall ensure he receives it promptly. And a week for the results. I appreciate your thoroughness, Doctor. And I will, of course, heed your advice regarding any unusual symptoms. One must be vigilant, doesn't one? It’s just… unsettling, really. To think something might be… amiss. I do try to maintain a positive outlook, but these things… they do tend to weigh on one’s mind. I trust everything will be perfectly alright?
DOCTOR: We will have a clearer picture after the blood work. It’s likely nothing to be concerned about, but it’s best to rule everything out. I'll have the nurse give you the requisition forms and schedule a follow-up appointment for a week from today. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I believe that is all. Thank you for your time and… reassurance. And please, do inform the nurse to be gentle with the gentleman’s form. He can be…sensitive. I appreciate your discretion in handling this matter. It is, as I mentioned, a delicate situation. I trust everything will proceed smoothly. I shall see you next week.
DOCTOR: Very well. The nurse will be with you shortly. Have a good day, Ms. Pandolfi. .
PATIENT: .
