DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Szmyd. I’m Dr. Hembrey. It’s a pleasure to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hmph. Good morning to you too, Doctor. New to this… place. Just moved here, you see? Needed to… get checked. Old man stuff, I guess. Medicare… they said I had to come. Don't really remember why exactly. Something about… being new? Is that right?
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Szmyd, it’s quite common for Medicare to require a welcome-to-Medicare physical when you establish care with a new physician. It’s a comprehensive assessment of your overall health. No need to be…dismissive. It’s a beneficial process. Let’s start with the basics. Can you describe any specific symptoms or concerns that prompted you to schedule this appointment, even if it’s just a general feeling of unwellness?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Hmph. What kind of question is that? I… feel old, okay? Everything hurts a little. Back, mostly. And my knees. Always my knees. But that’s just… life. I’ve been a makeup man for… a long time. Lots of standing. Bending. You wouldn’t understand. It’s not a sickness, it's… work.
DOCTOR: I understand that your discomfort is likely related to your profession, Mr. Szmyd. However, it’s still important for me to ascertain the nature and severity of your pain. "Hurts a little" can mean different things to different people. On a scale of zero to ten, with zero being no pain and ten being the worst pain imaginable, where would you rate your back pain at its worst?
PATIENT: Zero to ten? Oh, for goodness sake. You doctors and your numbers. Fine. When it’s bad… maybe a… six? Seven? It comes and goes, you see. Some days it's just a dull ache. Other days… I can barely stand. But I take… pills. Whatever my ex-wife gave me. They help. Mostly.
DOCTOR: “Whatever pills your ex-wife gave you” is…not particularly helpful information, Mr. Szmyd. Do you know the name of the medication?
PATIENT: Medication? Hmph. No! Women and their little bottles. White ones, I think. Small. She was always…organized. I don't bother with names. They just were pills. She said they were for…the aches. Honestly, Doctor, I just wanted to be left alone. Is it so hard to understand?
DOCTOR: It is difficult to provide appropriate care without knowing what medications you're taking, Mr. Szmyd. We need to identify potential interactions and ensure you are receiving safe and effective treatment. Do you have any of these “white pills” with you today?
PATIENT: White pills… hmm. Maybe. I have a bag… somewhere. Always keep things. For… emergencies. Let me see… Here. These are… them, I think. Don't stare. They're just pills.
DOCTOR: These are…ibuprofen, 200mg. And…naproxen, 220mg. Both NSAIDs. That explains some things, but taking both together, especially without a consistent schedule, is…less than ideal. Mr. Szmyd, these medications can have side effects, particularly on your stomach and kidneys. Now, let's move on. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmph. Don’t be ridiculous. I'm Russian, Doctor. We don’t have allergies. We drink vodka and eat pickles. We're… tough. Maybe… dust? Sometimes my nose itches. But that’s just… life. Stop looking at me like that.
DOCTOR: Mr. Szmyd, with all due respect, allergies are not determined by nationality. A sensitivity to dust is, in fact, a common allergy. And it’s important we document everything. Let’s clarify. Do you experience any other symptoms when exposed to dust, such as sneezing, a runny nose, or itchy eyes?
PATIENT: Sneezing… sometimes. Itchy eyes… maybe. Honestly, Doctor, I don’t pay attention to such… details. It's a little itch, okay? I rub my nose and move on. What is this, a detective game? Are you trying to find out if I'm secretly a… spy?
DOCTOR: No, Mr. Szmyd, I am not investigating your espionage activities. I am attempting to gather a comprehensive medical history. Let’s try a different approach. Have you had any serious illnesses or surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Serious illnesses? Hmph. Divorces are serious. Does that count? No. No surgeries. I've been lucky, I suppose. A few broken hearts, but that’s all. One time, I fell off a chair setting up a spotlight… sprained my wrist. But that was… a long time ago. Fixed it myself. Rubbed it with vodka, naturally.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let's discuss your family history. Are your parents still living?
PATIENT: Parents… both gone now. A long time ago. Old age, mostly. My mother… she was a strong woman. Always… worried. My father… a quiet man. Drank a lot of tea. Not much to tell, really. They were… parents. Lived a simple life. In Russia.
DOCTOR: I see. And did either of your parents have any significant medical conditions, such as heart disease, diabetes, cancer, or stroke?
PATIENT: Hmph. Heart trouble, maybe. My mother… always complaining about her chest. And my father… he got… fat. Really fat. Sat around all day. Probably diabetes. They didn't have… fancy doctors back then. Just… home remedies. And tea. Lots and lots of tea.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, let's talk about your social habits. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Smoke? Never. Dirty habit. Alcohol… sometimes. A little vodka, to relax. After a long day. Not much. Maybe a shot or two. Recreation drugs? Are you accusing me of something? I’m a makeup artist, Doctor! Not a… criminal.
DOCTOR: I am simply gathering information, Mr. Szmyd. Now, can you estimate how often you drink alcohol?
PATIENT: How often…? Hmph. When I feel like it. Maybe… once a week? Sometimes more. Sometimes less. Depends. If the work is bad. Or if I'm… alone. It’s not a problem, Doctor. I can stop anytime. I just… enjoy it. It’s a Russian tradition, you see.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, I'd like to conduct a brief physical examination. It will involve listening to your heart and lungs, checking your blood pressure, and assessing your joints. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Hmph. Fine. Whatever. Just get it over with. Don’t poke too hard. My back… it's sensitive, you know. And try not to… breathe down my neck. It's… unsettling.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Szmyd. If you could please sit up and remove your shirt… or at least loosen it significantly. I'll start with your heart and lungs. Your heart rate is a bit elevated… 88 beats per minute. Lungs are clear, but slightly diminished breath sounds at the bases. Blood pressure is 142 over 90. A little on the high side. And as expected, some tenderness along the lumbar spine. Limited range of motion. Knees exhibit some crepitus and mild swelling. Pain reported with flexion and extension. Alright. That concludes the basic examination. Based on what you've told me and my findings, your elevated blood pressure and back and knee pain are the primary concerns.
PATIENT: Hmph. See? I told you my knees were bad. And my back. You doctors always take so long to… figure things out. So what does it all mean? Do I need more pills? Or… vodka?
DOCTOR: Mr. Szmyd, it's premature to discuss specific treatments at this stage. Your blood pressure is elevated, which requires further investigation. We need to rule out any underlying causes. The knee and back pain appear to be related to wear and tear, likely osteoarthritis, but we should also obtain imaging to assess the extent of the damage. I’m going to order some blood work, including a complete metabolic panel, a lipid panel, and a urinalysis. I also want to get an X-ray of both knees and your lumbar spine. I will also recommend a consultation with a physical therapist for evaluation and potential management of your musculoskeletal pain. And, with all due respect, I strongly advise against self-treating with alcohol. It can exacerbate existing health conditions and interfere with any potential medications. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Hmph. Blood work… X-rays… Physical therapist… It's always something, isn't it? More poking and prodding. Fine. Do what you have to do. But don’t expect me to… enjoy it. As for the vodka… it helps me sleep. But fine. I’ll… try to cut back. Just… don’t lecture me. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Szmyd. I won’t lecture you. I’m simply concerned about your overall well-being. I'm going to write you a prescription for a low-dose anti-inflammatory to help with the pain while you await the imaging and physical therapy consultation. I will also send an order to the lab for the blood work. The nurse will be in shortly to draw the samples and provide you with instructions for the X-ray. I’d like to see you back in one week to discuss the results and formulate a comprehensive treatment plan. If you experience any sudden or severe pain, or if you develop a fever, please contact the office immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Questions…? Hmph. No. No questions. Just… get it over with. I have things to do. Makeup to apply, you see. People to… beautify. One week… fine. Just… don’t keep me waiting. .
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Szmyd. The nurse will be with you shortly. Thank you for your time. Have a…pleasant day. .
