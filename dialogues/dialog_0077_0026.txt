DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Oitker. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Pirl. It’s lovely to meet you. Now, could you tell me a bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s something the young man at the lab said. About my… what was it? My creatine… something. Said it was high. I just feel awfully tired these days, you see. More tired than usual, and I’ve always been a busy woman. A very busy woman. Commercial diving isn’t for the faint of heart, you know.
DOCTOR: Creatinine, yes. That's a blood test we sometimes use to assess kidney function. And you mentioned commercial diving… that is quite a profession. I appreciate you sharing that. Feeling tired despite being accustomed to a busy lifestyle is certainly something we should investigate. To help me understand things better, could you tell me a bit more about this tiredness?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s not just a little tiredness, Doctor. It’s… draining. Like someone’s let all the air out of me. And it comes and goes. Some days I can still manage things, you know, potter about, do a bit in the garden. But then other days… I just have to lie down. And it’s not like a normal lie-down, either. It’s… well, it’s like I’m glued to the sofa. My husband, bless him, he has to bring me everything. He’s a good man, but he doesn’t understand… things. He thinks a cup of tea will fix it.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds quite debilitating, especially when it interferes with your daily activities. And it’s good of your husband to be supportive, even if he doesn't fully grasp what you’re going through. This fluctuating nature – some days better, some days much worse – is helpful information. Now, aside from the fatigue, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Hmm. Let me think. My muscles… they ache, sometimes. Not all the time, mind you. Mostly in my legs. And I've been a bit… clumsy, I suppose. Dropped a few things. My knitting, mostly. It’s terribly frustrating. And… oh, yes! My urine. It’s… darker than usual, sometimes. A funny color. I wouldn’t say it's red, but… not normal. Is that important?
DOCTOR: Yes, those are all important things to mention, Ms. Oitker. Muscle aches and clumsiness, along with changes in your urine color… those can certainly be related. Darker urine is particularly noteworthy. Now, let's talk about your medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s a question. Old age comes with a few aches and pains, you know. I had my gallbladder out years ago. Decades ago. And… I think I had a touch of the flu last winter, but everyone gets that, don’t they? My husband keeps telling me to take more vitamins, but I don’t see the point. Honestly, Doctor, I've always been a healthy woman. Strong as an ox, I was. Until recently. It’s just… strange. And worrying.
DOCTOR: Yes, gallbladder removal years ago and a bout of the flu… that's helpful. And it’s good to know you've generally been healthy. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, not really. Just a little something for my arthritis, sometimes. When it flares up. It's… ibuprofen, I think? The white pills. And I take a calcium tablet with my breakfast, because of my age, you see. My daughter told me to. She worries terribly. But that’s it, really. Nothing fancy. I’ve never been one for pills, if I can help it.
DOCTOR: Alright. Ibuprofen for arthritis and calcium supplements… thank you. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical examination, if that’s alright. Just to check your overall health and see if we can identify anything that might be contributing to your fatigue and other symptoms. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Oh, very well. If you think it's necessary. Honestly, Doctor, I’ve been poked and prodded enough in my life. Being a diver, you get all sorts of inspections. But if you think it will help, go ahead. Just… be gentle, alright? My bones aren’t what they used to be.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Oitker. I will be as gentle as possible. First, let's check your blood pressure and pulse. Blood pressure is 148 over 86, and pulse is 72. A little elevated, but not drastically so. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, though a slight murmur is present. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Abdomen is soft, no tenderness to palpation. There’s slight edema in both ankles, and muscle strength is 4/5 in all extremities. Alright, Ms. Oitker. Based on the physical exam and your symptoms, there are a few things we need to consider. The edema and fatigue, along with the elevated creatinine your lab results showed, suggest possible kidney issues. The slight murmur could be unrelated, but it’s something we should monitor. I’d like to order some additional blood tests to get a clearer picture of your kidney function and rule out other possibilities.
PATIENT: Kidney issues? Oh, dear. My father had kidney trouble, I remember that. He was always so swollen. Is that what’s happening to me? Honestly, Doctor, I just want to feel like myself again. Able to potter about in the garden, knit a nice sweater… not be glued to the sofa. What kind of blood tests? Will they be painful? And how long will it take to get the results?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Oitker. It's natural to be worried. While your father having kidney trouble is something we need to consider, it doesn’t automatically mean you have the same condition. We need more information before we can draw any conclusions. The blood tests will be fairly standard – a complete metabolic panel, a creatinine level, and a few others to assess your kidney function and electrolytes. They won’t be painful, just a quick pinprick. The results usually take about 24 to 48 hours. In the meantime, I’d also like to order a urinalysis to check for protein and other abnormalities in your urine. Do you have any allergies to medications I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. A complete… what was it? Never mind. As long as it's not too painful. I don't think I'm allergic to anything. I’ve never had any trouble with any medication before. Though my daughter always says I should be careful. She's a worrier, that one. And… well, I did have a bit of a rash once, years ago, after I used a new hand cream. But that was just a mild rash, nothing serious. It went away on its own. But… honestly, Doctor, this is all a bit overwhelming. I just want a simple answer. What’s wrong with me?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Oitker. It’s perfectly normal to feel overwhelmed when facing uncertainty. We're doing our best to get to the bottom of this, and the tests will give us a clearer picture. The rash from the hand cream is good to know, so we’ll make a note of a possible sensitivity. It's difficult to give you a simple answer right now, as several factors could be contributing to your symptoms. But based on your fatigue, edema, elevated creatinine, and muscle aches, we need to investigate the possibility of kidney dysfunction. We'll also look into other causes, such as anemia or vitamin deficiencies. While we wait for the test results, I recommend you reduce your salt intake and drink plenty of fluids. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: Reduce salt… and drink more fluids. Well, that doesn’t sound too difficult. My husband always tells me I don’t drink enough water. He makes me a cup of tea constantly, though. Does tea count as fluid? And… what kind of fluids? Just water? Or can I have juice? And… what about the gardening? Should I avoid that until we know what’s wrong? It’s my favorite thing to do, you see. I have a lovely rose garden… it would just be dreadful to neglect it.
DOCTOR: Good questions, Ms. Oitker. Tea does count as fluid, but water is best, as it doesn’t contain any added salt or sugar. Juice is fine in moderation, but avoid sugary drinks. As for the gardening, I wouldn’t recommend strenuous activity until we have the test results. Light gardening, such as weeding or deadheading, should be okay, but avoid lifting heavy objects or prolonged bending. We want to avoid putting any extra strain on your kidneys. Let's schedule a follow-up appointment in two to three days to discuss the test results and create a plan. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Two to three days… alright. That doesn't sound too long. I suppose I can manage that. I’ll try to take it easy in the garden. Just a little bit of weeding, then. And I’ll drink more water. My husband will be pleased. He’s always nagging me about that. And… thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very patient with me. It's just… getting old is not for the faint of heart, you know.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Oitker. And you're right, getting older certainly has its challenges. But we’ll work through this together. I’m glad I could help ease your mind a bit. Now, I’ll have the nurse draw the blood samples and collect a urine sample. She’ll explain the procedure. We’ll see you in two to three days. If you experience any worsening of your symptoms—severe fatigue, difficulty breathing, or significant swelling—please contact the office immediately. Do you have any further questions before you leave?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. Just… thank you again, Doctor. You’ve been very kind. I’ll go see the nurse now, then. And I’ll try to stay positive. It’s just… it’s hard, you know? Hard to feel so… weak. But I’ll try.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Oitker. And you are quite right, it's not easy. But you seem like a strong woman, and I have faith you'll get through this. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns. Have a good day, and we’ll see you soon.
