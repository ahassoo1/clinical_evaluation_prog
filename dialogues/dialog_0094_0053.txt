DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Yadao. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Gegan. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It's nice to meet you too. Well, it's a bit embarrassing, to be honest. I've been having trouble… going to the bathroom. It's just… difficult to start, you know? And sometimes it feels like it doesn’t fully empty. It’s been going on for a couple of weeks now, I'd say.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Yadao, no need to be embarrassed at all. These things happen, and it’s good you’re addressing it. It's helpful that you've noticed it's been going on for a couple of weeks. When you say “difficult to start”, can you describe that a little more?
PATIENT: Hmm… well, I have to push, a little. Not a lot, but… more than usual. It doesn’t come right away, like it used to. And sometimes I have to go back a little while later because it feels like there's still some left. I do try to drink plenty of water, though. Always have.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful to know. Pushing to initiate and a sensation of incomplete emptying… I understand. And you mentioned you consistently drink plenty of water – that’s good. Have you noticed any changes in your urine stream itself?
PATIENT: Changes? Hmm… let me think. It doesn't hurt, not exactly. But it's… weaker than it used to be, I suppose. Not a strong stream like it was when I was younger, of course, but… weaker even than that recently. And it doesn’t go as far, if you know what I mean. It just sort of… dribbles a little at the end. It’s not a huge amount, but noticeable.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Yadao, thank you for sharing that detail. A weaker stream, reduced distance, and terminal dribbling… all important things to note. Now, let's talk a little bit more broadly. Have you experienced any fever, chills, or pain in your lower abdomen or back?
PATIENT: No, no fever or chills, thank goodness. And no pain either, not in my stomach or my back. Sometimes, if I sit for too long, I get a little… uncomfortable, a sort of pressure, but not pain. It goes away if I get up and move around a bit. It’s not a regular thing, though. Just every now and then.
DOCTOR: Okay, no fever, chills or abdominal/back pain, just intermittent pressure with prolonged sitting – that’s good information. Now, I’m going to ask a few questions about your medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, or kidney problems?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see… well, I had high blood pressure a few years back, but it's been well-controlled with medication for a long time now. The doctor checks it every six months, and it’s always good. Other than that… no, nothing really. No diabetes, no kidney problems that I know of. I had a gallbladder removed years ago, but that was a long time ago and didn’t cause any trouble since. I do have Medicare, so I see a doctor regularly.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Yadao, thank you. Well-controlled hypertension, a history of gallbladder removal years ago, and regular check-ups with Medicare – that’s helpful. Do you take any other medications besides the one for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Just a daily vitamin, Doctor. And sometimes I take something for aches and pains, but that's just ibuprofen, when I need it. Not every day, just if my joints are bothering me. And I take a calcium supplement, because my doctor said I should. But that’s about it, really. Nothing fancy.
DOCTOR: Okay, vitamin, calcium, ibuprofen as needed, and medication for hypertension. That's good to know. Now, let's talk about allergies. Do you have any known allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of, Doctor. I’ve always been pretty lucky that way. I eat just about anything, and I've never had a reaction to any medication. I remember my mother being very careful about allergies, but I seem to have gotten off scot-free! I do get mosquito bites, terribly, but that’s not an allergy, is it?
DOCTOR: No, mosquito bites don’t count as an allergy, Ms. Yadao. So, no known allergies – that’s good. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if you’re comfortable with that. We’ll just listen to your abdomen, do a quick neurological check, and then I’ll do a gentle exam of your pelvic area. This will help me get a better understanding of what might be going on. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly alright. I trust your judgment. I haven’t been feeling myself lately, so I’m happy to do whatever you think is best. Just… please be gentle, if you don’t mind. It’s just a little… embarrassing, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Yadao, I absolutely will be gentle. Your comfort is my priority. I understand it can be a little sensitive, and I’ll explain everything as I go. First, let’s listen to your abdomen. Please lie back on the exam table, and I'll just use the stethoscope here and here and here. Okay. I’m listening for any unusual sounds. Your abdomen is soft, and I don’t feel any masses. Now, I’m going to palpate gently to check for tenderness. Does this cause any discomfort?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, that doesn't hurt. A little… pressure, maybe, but nothing uncomfortable. Just like when I sit for too long, a sort of fullness. But no sharp pain, or anything like that. It feels… normal, really. It's just been going on, you know? I worry sometimes, because my mother had some trouble with her bladder when she was older.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Yadao, thank you. No sharp pain, just some fullness and pressure. And I appreciate you sharing your mother’s history; that’s helpful information. Everything seems normal here, reflexes are intact and sensation is good. Now, I’m going to do a quick external exam of your pelvic area. Again, please let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. I’m just looking for any obvious abnormalities. I don't note any visible abnormalities. Now, I’d like to get a urine sample from you. We’ll send that to the lab to check for infection or other issues. And, given your symptoms and your mother's history, I'd like to order a post-void residual volume test. This will measure how much urine remains in your bladder after you empty it. This can give us a better understanding of how well your bladder is emptying. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly alright, Doctor. A urine sample and… what was it, a post-void residual… test? Yes, whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. I just want to feel like myself again. Where should I go to give the sample? And do I need to do anything special for the other test?
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Yadao. I’m glad you feel comfortable with that plan. The restroom is just down the hall. There’s a collection cup in there. Just try to give a midstream sample – meaning start urinating, then collect a small amount in the cup, and finish urinating. For the post-void residual volume test, after you urinate, please let me know right away. I’ll use a small handheld ultrasound device to measure how much urine is still in your bladder. It’s a quick and painless procedure. Once we have the results of these tests, we can discuss the next steps. In the meantime, try to drink your usual amount of water, and avoid caffeine and alcohol, as they can sometimes irritate the bladder. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think that's all very clear. Drinking water, no caffeine or alcohol… I can do that. It’s just a little… worrying, you know? But I feel better knowing we’re doing something about it. Thank you for listening, and for explaining everything so thoroughly. I’ll go give the sample now, and let you know when I'm finished.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Yadao. It's perfectly natural to feel worried, but we’re going to get to the bottom of this. I'll be right here when you’re finished. Please don’t hesitate to let me know if you have any discomfort or if anything feels off. Take your time.
