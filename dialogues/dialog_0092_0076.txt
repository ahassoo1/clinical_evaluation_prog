DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Aluia. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Giganti. It's nice to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. It's nice to meet you as well. Well, it's these bumps on my legs... my shins, mostly. They’re red and kinda painful. Been bothering me for a little while now.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Red, painful bumps on your shins. And you said this has been going on for a “little while”?
PATIENT: Yeah, a little while. Maybe… a couple of months now? It started with just one or two, and I didn't think much of it. But then more kept popping up, and they started hurting more, especially if I bump into something. My wife, Elena, told me I should finally get it checked out. She worries a lot, that one.
DOCTOR: It's good that you came in, and it’s very thoughtful of Elena to encourage you to seek medical attention. A couple of months, you said. Have you noticed anything that makes them worse, or better?
PATIENT: Hmm... that's a good question. I don't know if anything makes them worse, exactly. But they definitely bother me more after I’ve been on my feet all day. I do a lot of moving things around at work, you know? Boxes, supplies... heavy stuff. And I think… maybe they look a little worse when it’s hot? I haven't really paid close attention, to be honest. It’s been pretty warm lately.
DOCTOR: Alright, so they tend to flare up with activity and possibly heat. Do you recall any injury to your legs that might have started this?
PATIENT: Injury? Not that I remember. I bump my legs all the time at work, honestly. It's part of the job. But I don’t recall any big injury that would have caused this. No, I don't think so. It just… started appearing slowly, you know? Not like a bruise or anything.
DOCTOR: Okay. And have you noticed any other symptoms along with the bumps?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… let me think. No fever, no chills. They don't itch, which is good, I guess. Just… painful. Sometimes my legs feel a little tired at the end of the day, but I’m 71 years old, Doctor! I figure that’s just getting old.
DOCTOR: That's fair. No itching, no fever, no chills, just pain and some fatigue. Now, let’s go over a bit of your medical history, if you don’t mind. Do you have any current medical conditions that we should be aware of?
PATIENT: Oh, okay. Let's see… Well, I have high blood pressure, the doctor told me a few years back. I take a pill for that, every morning. And… I had my gallbladder taken out a long time ago, maybe 20 years now? Other than that, I think I’m pretty healthy for my age. My wife keeps me going, makes me eat right and exercise.
DOCTOR: Alright, high blood pressure managed with medication, and a gallbladder removal a long time ago. Do you know the name of the medication you take for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Hmm... that's a good question. I just tell the pharmacist to give me the usual refill, you know? I don't really remember the name. It's a little white pill. Elena probably knows. She's the one who keeps track of all that stuff. I’m sorry, Doctor. I’m not very good with names.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Mr. Aluia. We can always look it up in your records. Now, are you allergic to any medications?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I've taken a lot of different medicines over the years, and I've never had a bad reaction to any of them. Nothing I can recall, anyway. My wife always tells them I have no allergies when I go to the doctor, too.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. And do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh no, Doctor. I don't do any of that. Never have. I used to smoke when I was younger, a long time ago, but I quit when I got married. Elena wouldn't allow it. And I don't drink much alcohol, maybe a glass of wine with dinner sometimes. Definitely no drugs.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s good to know. Now, I’m going to need to examine your legs. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. Whatever you need to do. I’m ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Aluia. I’m just going to feel around a bit. Let me know if anything is particularly tender. Alright. I’m noting some redness and inflammation on your shins, particularly in these areas. They are tender to the touch, as you mentioned. I'm also noticing some small, slightly raised areas within the bumps. Do you have good circulation in your legs, generally?
PATIENT: Yeah, I think so. I don’t have any problems with swelling or cramping, usually. Sometimes they feel tired after a long day, but nothing too bad. Elena always rubs them with lotion, says it helps.
DOCTOR: Okay. And have you traveled anywhere recently?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Haven't been further than the grocery store in months! Mostly just stay around here. Elena likes it that way. She doesn’t like me traveling too far.
DOCTOR: Alright. Based on the examination and what you've told me, it appears you may have stasis dermatitis, which is common in individuals with circulation issues, even mild ones. However, to rule out other possibilities, I would like to order a few tests. Specifically, I’d like to check your venous Doppler to assess blood flow in your legs and a complete blood count to rule out infection. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Venous… what now? Oh… you mean a test on my legs? To check the blood? Yeah, that sounds alright, Doctor. If you think it’s best. Elena always says it’s better to be safe than sorry. Just… what does all that mean? Is it something serious?
DOCTOR: It’s a test to see how well the blood is flowing in your legs, Mr. Aluia. It doesn't necessarily mean it's serious. Stasis dermatitis occurs when blood pools in the legs, causing inflammation and these bumps. It’s often related to mild venous insufficiency, meaning the valves in your veins aren’t working as efficiently as they should. The complete blood count is just to rule out any infection. We want to be thorough. If it is stasis dermatitis, it’s generally manageable with compression stockings, elevation of your legs, and topical creams. We would also discuss any lifestyle modifications, like regular exercise to improve circulation. I will have the nurse draw blood for the complete blood count, and we will schedule the venous Doppler for later this week. In the meantime, try to elevate your legs as much as possible, especially when you're resting, and avoid prolonged standing. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Okay… that sounds… a little better. So it’s not something terrible? Compression stockings… like those tight things my wife’s aunt wears? Yeah, that sounds reasonable, Doctor. Elevate my legs… I can do that. And I’ll try to avoid standing too long, even though it’s hard at work. Tell me, how long will it take to get the test results? And should I be worried if they find something else?
DOCTOR: Yes, those are similar to what your wife's aunt wears, Mr. Aluia. They help improve blood flow back towards your heart. As for the results, the blood work should be back within 24 to 48 hours. The venous Doppler might take a day or two longer, as it requires a technician to interpret the images. It’s natural to be concerned, but we are being proactive to get a clear understanding of what’s going on. If we do find something else, it doesn't necessarily mean it’s serious either. It just means we'll tailor the treatment plan accordingly. We might need to consult with a vascular specialist, if necessary, but we'll cross that bridge when we come to it. For now, let's focus on getting these tests done. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s all for now, Doctor. You explained everything very clearly. Thank you for taking the time to listen to me and for not making me feel like I’m worrying over nothing. I appreciate that. I guess I’ll go wait for the nurse, then.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Aluia. It’s my pleasure. I understand your concerns, and I'm glad I could ease some of your worries. Please let the nurse know if you have any questions as well. I’ll see you soon. Have a good day, and remember to elevate those legs! .
