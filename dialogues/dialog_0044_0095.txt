DOCTOR: Good morning, Stephane. It's lovely to meet you. I'm Dr. Asami. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning. Look, I don’t have a lot of time, so let’s just get this over with. I woke up this morning and I can’t hear out of one ear, and my face feels… droopy on that side. It’s quite inconvenient, really. I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand you’re pressed for time, and we’ll certainly get to the bottom of this as efficiently as possible. But it's important we take the necessary steps, even if it feels rushed. Sudden hearing loss and facial droop are concerning symptoms, and we need to figure out what’s going on. Just to be clear – it happened this morning, when you woke up?
PATIENT: Yes, this morning. Honestly, are you even listening? I woke up, and boom, nothing on the left side. And my face… it just feels weak. Like half of it isn’t working properly. It's quite obvious, isn't it? I don’t need a detailed explanation of what feels weak. I know my own body.
DOCTOR: Yes, Stephane, I am listening, and I apologize if I came across as if I weren’t. You’re right to be concerned, and it is obvious something is wrong. It’s good you’re aware of the changes in your body. We need to explore this thoroughly. To help me understand, can you tell me if anything else happened this morning?
PATIENT: Look, nothing happened. I woke up. I went to the bathroom. And I discovered I was partially paralyzed and deaf. Is that specific enough for you? I didn't fall, I didn’t hit my head, I haven’t been sick. I simply… woke up like this. It's incredibly frustrating, and frankly, a little frightening, but I assure you, I did not do anything to cause this. Do you need a list of everything I ate yesterday? Because that seems like a waste of time.
DOCTOR: No, a detailed food list isn’t necessary right now. You’re right to be frustrated, and your concern is completely valid. Sudden onset like this is concerning, and we need to act quickly to understand the cause. To clarify, when you say “droopy” on the left side of your face, can you describe exactly what you're noticing?
PATIENT: It means exactly what it sounds like! My mouth feels… uneven. When I smile, the left side doesn't lift properly. It just… hangs. And when I try to raise my eyebrow, it doesn’t move as much on the left. Do I need to draw you a diagram? It’s very obvious. It’s like… half my face is frozen. I’m a radiologist, Dr. Asami, I understand anatomy. Are we going to do something about it or just keep asking pointless questions?
DOCTOR: You are absolutely right to point that out, Stephane. My apologies – I shouldn’t be asking questions without a clear purpose. And being a radiologist, you certainly have a keen understanding of anatomy, which is helpful. Okay. Let’s do a quick exam. I'm going to check your facial movements, your hearing, and do a brief neurological assessment. This will give me a better idea of what we’re dealing with. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Just get it over with. Honestly, the longer I sit here, the more worried I become. I have patients waiting, you know. This is incredibly disruptive. But yes, go ahead. Just be quick about it.
DOCTOR: Alright, Stephane. I’ll be as efficient as possible. First, I’m going to take a look in your ears with this otoscope. It won’t be uncomfortable, just let me know if anything feels strange. Okay, the ear canal looks clear. No obvious signs of infection or blockage. Now, I’m going to shine this light in your pupils and check your reflexes. Follow the light with your eyes, please. Okay. When I ask you to smile, there's definite weakness on the left side, as you described. The left cheek doesn’t elevate as fully, and the nasolabial fold is slightly flattened. Closing your eyes, there seems to be some difficulty with complete closure on the left. Now, can you tell me if you're experiencing any other symptoms at all?
PATIENT: No, that’s it. Just the face and the ear. No headache, no dizziness, no vision changes, no neck stiffness, no nausea. Nothing else. I feel perfectly… normal, aside from the obvious. Look, are we any closer to figuring out what’s wrong? Because this is getting ridiculous. I need a diagnosis, and I need a treatment plan. I don’t have time for a mystery.
DOCTOR: You're right to press me, Stephane. Based on what you’ve told me, and the quick exam I've performed, the most likely diagnosis at this point is Bell’s palsy. It's a condition caused by inflammation of the facial nerve, which causes weakness or paralysis on one side of the face. The sudden onset, the lack of other neurological symptoms, and the isolated facial weakness are all consistent with that diagnosis. However, it’s crucially important to rule out other, more serious causes. A stroke, for example, needs to be excluded, even though the presentation isn’t typical. To do that, I’d like to order a CT scan of your brain. It will allow us to quickly visualize the brain and rule out any structural issues. Would you be able to undergo a CT scan today?
PATIENT: A CT scan? Honestly. All this fuss over… Bell’s palsy? Is that really necessary? It sounds… inconvenient. And expensive, I presume. I haven’t even bothered to get insurance since… well, never mind. Look, I understand you need to be thorough, but can't we just try… something else first? A steroid, perhaps? I’ve read about those being effective for Bell's palsy. Can't we start with that and see if it improves before subjecting me to radiation? It just seems… excessive. And time-consuming. I have appointments, you know.
DOCTOR: You’re right to question me, Stephane, and I appreciate your concerns about the CT scan, both the inconvenience and the cost. I understand your hesitancy, especially without insurance. The reason I insist on the CT scan isn’t to doubt your self-diagnosis – you have a strong medical background, and your assessment is valuable. However, it’s my responsibility to rule out other possibilities that could present similarly to Bell’s palsy, specifically a stroke. Even though the presentation isn’t typical, we must exclude it. While steroids are indeed a standard treatment for Bell’s palsy, starting them before ruling out a stroke would be irresponsible. If it is a stroke, steroids could be harmful. I understand your concerns about cost. Let me see if we can explore options for financial assistance at the clinic. And I can expedite the scan as quickly as possible to minimize the disruption to your schedule. Would you be willing to consider the scan, knowing we’ll do everything we can to make it as convenient and affordable as possible?
PATIENT: Fine. But if it turns out to be nothing, you're going to owe me a significant amount of time. And a very detailed apology. And yes, explore every single option for reducing the cost. I do not want a massive bill. And make it quick, Dr. Asami. I have a schedule to keep, and I’m wasting valuable hours sitting here. Just get it done. The faster we rule out this… stroke, the better. And please, tell me how long this is going to take. A rough estimate, at least.
DOCTOR: I completely understand your frustration, Stephane, and I assure you, I’ll do everything I can to expedite the process. And again, I apologize for the inconvenience. The CT scan itself should only take about 15-20 minutes. After that, the radiologist will need to review the images, which usually takes another 30-60 minutes. I’ll be in touch as soon as I have the results, hopefully within a couple of hours. In the meantime, I’ll have the clinic’s financial coordinator reach out to you to discuss payment options and any available assistance programs. I'll get the order for the scan sent to the radiology department immediately. A technician will come up to escort you down shortly. Do you have any questions for me before they arrive?
PATIENT: No. Just… get it over with. And please, tell the technician to be quick as well. I’m not getting any younger sitting here. And if it is just Bell’s palsy, I expect a prompt and effective treatment plan. No delays. I’m a busy woman, Dr. Asami. This is taking up a significant amount of my time. .
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Stephane. I understand. I’ll personally follow up with the radiology department to ensure a speedy review of the images, and we’ll discuss a treatment plan as soon as the results are available. Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns at any point. I’ll leave you to wait for the technician, and I’ll be in touch shortly. .
