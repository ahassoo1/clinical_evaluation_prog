DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Woodring. I am Dr. Yackey. I understand you’re here today for a consultation. Could you please tell me, in your own words, what brings you in?
PATIENT: Look, I really don’t have a lot of time for this. It’s…well, it’s my stomach. Been having trouble for weeks now. Diarrhea. Just…constant. And nothing seems to stop it. I’ve tried everything the pharmacy suggested, and it’s still happening. Frankly, it’s embarrassing to even talk about. Is that all you need to know?
DOCTOR: Weeks, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, weeks. At least a month, maybe longer. I honestly lost track. It started a little bit after…well, after my husband passed. I don’t see what that has to do with anything, though. It’s just…ongoing. And getting worse, if that matters. I need something that actually works, not just…suggestions.
DOCTOR: Right. And has there been any blood in your stool, Ms. Woodring?
PATIENT: Blood? Ugh. Honestly, I try not to look. It’s… unpleasant. I think… maybe once or twice. It wasn't a lot, but yeah, I saw some. Look, I’m not one for details, okay? It’s a stomach thing, not a history lesson. Is that going to change what you do? Because if it’s just going to be more questions about… that, I really don’t have the patience.
DOCTOR: Hmm. And any fever, nausea, vomiting, or abdominal pain alongside the diarrhea?
PATIENT: Look, are you a doctor or an interrogator? It’s my stomach, not a whole-body exam. I feel…crummy, alright? Weak. And my stomach hurts, obviously. Like…cramps. And sometimes I feel a bit sick to my stomach, but I haven't actually thrown up. I’m not going to list every little symptom, okay? I just want to get this fixed. Is this going to take much longer?
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s do a quick exam. Please lie down on the examination table. I'll need to listen to your abdomen and palpate it. Just to rule out anything… obvious.
PATIENT: Fine. But don't go poking around too much. And try to be quick about it, please. I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Alright. Normal bowel sounds, though somewhat hyperactive. Palpation reveals some tenderness in the lower left quadrant, but no rigidity. No rebound tenderness. Have you had any recent travel, Ms. Woodring?
PATIENT: Travel? Seriously? Where would I be traveling to? I haven’t left town in… well, a long time. Definitely not recently. I barely leave the house as it is. What does that even matter? Is this a standard question or are you just trying to fill time?
DOCTOR: It’s standard procedure, Ms. Woodring. Just ruling things out. And any changes to your diet recently?
PATIENT: Look, my diet hasn’t changed. I eat… sensibly. I’m not one of those people who tries every fad thing, alright? It’s not like I suddenly started eating exotic foods. I’m a practical person. I eat what’s available, what’s easy. And it hasn’t changed! Is this getting us anywhere or are we just going around in circles? I really need to get this sorted.
DOCTOR: Alright. Given the duration and persistent nature of your symptoms, and the intermittent spotting of blood, I’m going to order a stool sample analysis to rule out any infection or parasitic cause. And a complete blood count to assess for anemia. I’ll also order a C. difficile toxin assay, just to be thorough. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: More tests. Wonderful. Fine, whatever. Just…get it over with. I suppose. As long as it actually helps. Will I have to come back here for the results, or… what’s the process? And can you just tell me, straight up, if it's something serious or not? I don’t want to be strung along.
DOCTOR: The lab is just down the hall, Ms. Woodring. They will give you instructions for collecting the sample. The results will take approximately three to five business days. Once they are available, my office will contact you to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. As for whether it's "serious," it's impossible to say definitively without the results. However, persistent diarrhea with blood warrants investigation. I wouldn’t want to cause undue alarm, but we need to rule out anything concerning. I recommend you avoid any anti-diarrheal medications until after we have the results, as they can interfere with the analysis. Is that understood?
PATIENT: Fine. Three to five days? That’s ridiculous. And no medication? So I’m just supposed to…suffer? Look, I appreciate you trying to be…thorough, I guess. But this is really inconvenient. Alright. I’ll go do the test. Just… please get the results back quickly. And contact me as soon as you know something. Don't make me come back here again for nothing. .
