DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Woodring. Dr. Blim. I see you’re here today. Let's get straight to it. What brings you in?
PATIENT: Honestly? This has been going on way too long. I’ve tried… things. You know, what people usually do when they get a bad stomach. It just won't stop. And it's embarrassing to even talk about, but here I am.
DOCTOR: "Things," you say. Could you be more specific, Ms. Woodring?
PATIENT: Ugh, really? Do I have to spell it out? I've been avoiding certain foods, drinking more water… the usual. And I took some of those things you can buy at the store. You know, the pink stuff and the white pills. Nothing's helped. It's just… constant. And it's been weeks. I don't have time for this, honestly. I have work to do.
DOCTOR: Right. “Pink stuff and white pills.” While I appreciate your… brevity, Ms. Woodring, a proper medical history requires a little more detail. Do you recall the names of these medications?
PATIENT: Look, I don't go around memorizing brand names for every little thing I take when my stomach is upset, okay? It was something... Pepto-Bismol, maybe? And something for… diarrhea. The kind you see on TV. Honestly, they all seem the same to me. It doesn't matter what I took, it didn’t work. Are you going to help me or just quiz me on over-the-counter drugs?
DOCTOR: Ms. Woodring, a precise history is crucial. I need to understand exactly what you’ve taken to avoid potential interactions and to properly assess your condition. But very well. Let's move on, though I find this… frustrating. Now, describe this "constant" issue. Is it pain?
PATIENT: It's not pain, exactly. It's… urgency. Like I need to go right now, and then immediately after, I need to go again. And it's... watery. A lot of it. It's just… unpleasant. And exhausting. I've barely left the house in days. It’s messing with my schedule, and I have jobs waiting. It's not a comfortable topic, but that’s what it is. Really, I just want it to stop.
DOCTOR: "Watery," you say. And for how long precisely have these… episodes been occurring?
PATIENT: Oh, I don't know, a little over two weeks, maybe? It started gradually, just feeling a little off, then got worse and worse. It's hard to keep track when you're constantly running to the bathroom. Look, is this going anywhere? Because I really don’t have all day to sit here and rehash the timeline of my bowel movements.
DOCTOR: Ms. Woodring, patience is a virtue. I am attempting to gather sufficient information to provide appropriate care. Two weeks. And have you noticed any blood in your stool?
PATIENT: Blood? No! Absolutely not. Look, if there was blood, do you really think I'd be casually describing this? I’m not that oblivious. It's just...water. A lot of water. And it’s incredibly inconvenient. I have a reputation to maintain, you know? People rely on me for my work. This is putting everything behind schedule.
DOCTOR: Very well. No blood. Let’s proceed. Have you experienced any fever, nausea, or vomiting accompanying these… episodes?
PATIENT: No fever. Maybe a little queasy sometimes, but nothing I haven't handled before. And no vomiting. It's mostly just the...urgency. And the… mess. Honestly, I’m starting to feel a little lightheaded just talking about it. Can we get to the part where you actually do something to help me?
DOCTOR: Given your history - or rather, the limited information you’ve provided – and the absence of fever, it is possible this is a viral gastroenteritis. However, given the duration of your symptoms, further investigation is warranted. I am going to need to perform a brief physical examination. Specifically, I will palpate your abdomen. Do you have any abdominal pain I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Look, I told you, it’s not pain. It’s… discomfort. Like a constant rumbling. And if I don't get to a bathroom quickly, then that’s uncomfortable. Just… be quick about it, okay? I really don't want to be lying on that paper table any longer than I have to. And don't poke too hard.
DOCTOR: Very well. Lie back on the examination table, Ms. Woodring. I will perform a brief abdominal palpation. Please inform me of any… discomfort. Now, take a deep breath. Any tenderness here?
PATIENT: Ugh, it's not comfortable. No, not pain, just… awareness. It feels a little tight, I guess. Mostly lower down. And stop poking around so much! It’s making me nervous, and you know what that does to my stomach. Just get it over with, please. I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Slight tenderness in the lower quadrants. Normal bowel sounds present. No rebound tenderness. No guarding. Given these findings, and the lack of significant abnormalities on physical examination, I suspect irritable bowel syndrome, potentially exacerbated by a mild viral insult. However, to rule out other possibilities, I will order a stool sample to test for bacterial pathogens and parasites. I will also order a basic metabolic panel to assess your electrolyte balance, given your reports of urgency.
PATIENT: Stool sample? Seriously? Do I have to go collect that myself? Because honestly… that sounds awful. And electrolytes? Look, I just need something to stop it. Is there a pill for that? Something I can take right now? I don’t need a science experiment, I need a solution. I have a reputation to maintain, you know? This is ridiculous. .
DOCTOR: Ms. Woodring, I understand your frustration. However, proper diagnosis requires appropriate testing. Yes, you will need to collect a stool sample. The laboratory will provide instructions. As for a “pill to stop it,” there is no magic cure. I can prescribe an antidiarrheal medication, but it is a temporary solution, and masking the symptoms without addressing the underlying cause can be counterproductive. Here is a prescription for loperamide. Take two capsules initially, then one capsule after each loose stool, up to eight capsules per day. Do not exceed the maximum dosage. I have also ordered the stool sample and basic metabolic panel. You will receive instructions regarding sample collection. Please follow those carefully. Schedule a follow-up appointment in one week to discuss the results of your tests. If your symptoms worsen significantly – if you develop fever, severe abdominal pain, or blood in your stool – seek immediate medical attention. Now, do you have any further questions, or may we conclude this consultation?
