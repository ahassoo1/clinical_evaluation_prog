DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Stoegbauer. I'm Dr. Hembrey. It's a pleasure to meet you. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. Please, call me Emiliano. It’s… my foot. It’s been bothering me for a little while now. It hurts, and there’s a sore that won't get better. It’s on the bottom, I think.
DOCTOR: Alright, Emiliano. A sore on the bottom of your foot that’s been causing you pain. Can you tell me a little more about this pain?
PATIENT: Hmm… well, it’s not a sharp pain, not all the time. More like… a dull ache. And it feels worse when I stand for too long, or walk a lot. Even just putting on my slippers sometimes makes it hurt. It’s been getting… slower to heal, that’s for sure. I don’t remember hurting it, not really.
DOCTOR: So, a dull ache that's exacerbated by standing and walking, and it’s been slow to heal. You don’t recall any specific injury?
PATIENT: No, I don't. Not that I can remember, anyway. Old age, you know? Things slip your mind. I just noticed it one day, and it hasn’t gotten much better since. I mostly just try to stay off it, but… it’s hard. I like to be doing things.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s frustrating when your body doesn’t cooperate. Now, let’s talk about your overall health. Do you have any other medical conditions – things like diabetes, heart problems, or anything else I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. The doctor told me a long time ago I have… the sugar sickness. Diabetes, that’s it. I take pills for it, every morning. And… I had some trouble with my heart, years ago, but they gave me some medicine for that too. I think that's all. I go to the doctor regularly for checkups, but… it's been a while since they looked at my foot.
DOCTOR: Alright, so you have a history of diabetes and some prior heart issues, both managed with medication. That’s important information. Are you currently taking any other medications besides those for your diabetes and heart?
PATIENT: Let me think... sometimes I take something for my knees, when they really bother me. It's a white pill, small one. And… sometimes a little something for sleeping, if I can’t get to sleep. But not every night, just when I really need it. I can’t remember the names, I’m sorry. My daughter usually helps me with all that.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Emiliano. We can sort through everything. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I eat everything, pretty much. And I haven’t had any bad reactions to the pills the doctor gives me. I'm pretty lucky that way, I think. Never had trouble with allergies.
DOCTOR: Good. Now, I'd like to take a look at your foot. Please have a seat and I'll examine it. We'll start with a visual inspection, and then I'll check the sensation and circulation. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. It’s been bothering me so much, I’m glad you’re looking at it.
DOCTOR: Alright, I see the sore here on the plantar surface – the bottom of your foot. It appears to be ulcerated, and there's some surrounding redness. It is warm to the touch, and you do flinch when I press on it. Do you feel any numbness or tingling in your foot or toes?
PATIENT: Yes, a little bit. Not all the time, but sometimes. Mostly in my toes, like they’re… asleep. It’s not a bad feeling, but it’s there. It's been happening more lately, I think. And sometimes my feet feel cold, even when they shouldn’t.
DOCTOR: Okay. I’m checking the circulation in your foot. Your pulses are… diminished, but present. That’s not entirely unexpected given your history, but it's something we need to monitor. Now, I’m going to check the sensation in your foot using a small filament. This will help me determine if there’s any nerve damage. It doesn’t hurt, but please let me know if you feel anything at all.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. I’ll tell you if I feel anything. It’s… strange. Like a little tickle sometimes, but mostly nothing. It’s harder to feel things in my feet these days.
DOCTOR: Alright. As I suspected, there’s some loss of sensation in your foot, particularly in the toes. This, combined with the diminished pulses and the ulceration, is concerning. Given your history of diabetes, this is likely a diabetic foot ulcer. It’s important to address this promptly to prevent infection and potential complications. I'm going to order some blood work to check your blood sugar levels and look for signs of infection. We may also need to get an X-ray to rule out any bone involvement. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: Oh dear. A diabetic… what did you call it? Ulcer? That sounds… bad. So, the sugar sickness is causing this? And you need to check the blood? Will I need… surgery? I don’t want surgery, Doctor. I’m too old for surgery. What can we do to make it better? Just medicine?
DOCTOR: It’s understandable to be concerned, Emiliano. A diabetic ulcer means that the high blood sugar levels over time have damaged the nerves and blood vessels in your feet, making them more susceptible to sores and slower to heal. It doesn’t necessarily mean you’ll need surgery. We'll start with conservative management—that means non-surgical treatments. The blood work will help us get a better understanding of how well your diabetes is controlled, and we’ll work on optimizing that. We’ll also need to keep the ulcer clean and protected to prevent infection. Offloading pressure from the area is crucial – that means reducing the amount of weight you put on your foot. We may recommend a special shoe or orthotic. I will consult with a podiatrist—a foot specialist—to get their opinion as well. They can help with debridement—removing any dead tissue from the ulcer—and provide specialized wound care. We'll discuss all of your options and create a treatment plan together. Before we get to that, are you currently experiencing any fever, chills, redness spreading from the wound, or increased pain?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No fever. No chills. The redness hasn't spread, and the pain is… just the same. Dull ache, mostly. It's worse when I stand, like I said. It doesn't feel… hot, if that makes sense. Just… sore. I haven't noticed anything different, except maybe it's a little smellier than usual, but… old people smell, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright, that's good that you haven't noticed any signs of worsening infection. The odor could be from the ulcer, but it’s something we'll keep a close eye on. Given your symptoms, and the exam findings, my assessment is a diabetic foot ulcer, stage 1. This means it's localized to the skin and hasn't involved deeper tissues yet. We need to prevent it from getting worse. I will order the blood work and an X-ray of your foot. I'm also going to write a referral to Dr. Matsumoto, a podiatrist, for further evaluation and wound care. In the meantime, it is extremely important that you avoid putting any weight on your affected foot as much as possible. I’m going to provide you with a pair of crutches to help with that. We will follow up in one week to review the results of the tests and discuss the podiatrist’s recommendations. Do you have any questions before we proceed?
PATIENT: Crutches? Oh dear. I haven’t used crutches since I was a boy! I’m afraid I’ll fall. But… okay. If you think it’s best. So, blood work and a foot doctor. And stay off my foot. Will I be able to still… go to church? It’s important to me to go to church. And see my grandchildren. I don’t want to be stuck inside all the time.
DOCTOR: I understand, Emiliano. It's important to maintain your quality of life, and I wouldn't want you to miss church or seeing your grandchildren. We’ll work together to find a solution that allows you to do as much as possible while protecting your foot. The crutches are just temporary, to help offload pressure while the ulcer heals. We can discuss strategies to minimize your risk of falling – perhaps using a walker instead, or enlisting the help of your family. The podiatrist may also recommend a special boot or shoe once the ulcer starts to heal. We'll take things one step at a time, and I'll provide you with all the support you need. I'll write you a prescription for the crutches now, and the lab requisition for the blood work. Here are some instructions on how to prepare for the blood draw, and a list of questions to ask Dr. Matsumoto. Do you have any other concerns or questions before we finish up for today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think that’s all. You’ve been very helpful. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly. I’m still worried, but… I feel better knowing we have a plan. I will try my best to stay off my foot, and I’ll go see the foot doctor. Thank you again. I think I’ll just… slowly get up now.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Emiliano. Please take your time getting up. Remember, we're in this together. If you experience any worsening pain, redness, swelling, or fever, please don't hesitate to contact the office immediately. I'll see you back here in one week. Have a good day, and please be careful. .
