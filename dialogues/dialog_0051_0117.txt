DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Reyno. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Glazewski. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Uh, yeah. Doc, right? Look, I got a cough. Been coughin' up... stuff. Red stuff. Not good. I smoke, you know. Been smokin’ a long time. That got somethin’ to do with it, I guess. I just want it to stop, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Mr. Reyno. A cough with red-colored sputum… that’s certainly something we need to look into. And you’re right to mention the smoking history; that’s very important information. To get a better understanding of what's going on, could you tell me a little more about this cough?
PATIENT: More about it… hmm. It started… a while ago. Maybe a couple weeks? Hard to say, honestly. Happens mostly in the mornin’, when I first wake up. And when I try to… you know… clear my throat real hard. It’s… wet. And like I said, red. Not a lot, but enough to worry me. I don't really feel sick sick, if you get me. Just… this cough. It’s botherin’ me.
DOCTOR: I understand. So, it's been going on for a couple of weeks, primarily in the morning and when you clear your throat, and you're noticing red-colored sputum. You don't feel generally unwell, other than the cough itself. Okay. Has this cough been getting worse, staying the same, or getting better at all during those two weeks?
PATIENT: Worse, I think. Yeah, definitely worse. Started small, just a little tickle. Now… now it's… a real cough. I gotta hack to get it up. And more red stuff each time, I reckon. Not a lot, but… more. I don't know. It's just… feelin' kinda scared, to be honest. Old man’s cough, you know? And I smoke. Doesn't help.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Reyno. It's good you're paying attention to these changes. A cough that’s progressively worsening, especially with red sputum and your smoking history, is something we definitely need to investigate. Now, aside from the cough and the red sputum, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… hmm. Let me think. I get tired easy, I guess. But I always get tired easy. Old age, right? No fever, nothin’ like that. Maybe a little short of breath when I walk up the hill to the store, but I live up a hill! Used to be able to walk it no problem. And… sometimes I get a little chest pain. Not sharp, just… a dull ache. Comes and goes. That's about it, I think. Memory ain't what it used to be, so I might be forgettin’ somethin’.
DOCTOR: Okay, so fatigue, some shortness of breath with exertion – walking uphill specifically – and a dull chest pain that comes and goes. It’s good you’re mentioning these things, even if they seem minor. And don’t worry about your memory; it’s perfectly normal for things to slip our minds. Now, I’m going to ask a few questions about your medical history, if that’s alright. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Medical conditions… Uh… the doc back on the reservation, years ago, told me my blood pressure was a little high. Gave me some pills for it. I stopped takin’ ‘em after a while. Didn’t feel like they were doin’ much. Other than that… nothin’ I can think of. Never been in the hospital, nothin’ serious like that. Just the usual old man aches and pains. Medicare covers me, if that matters.
DOCTOR: Okay, a history of high blood pressure that you were previously treated for, but stopped taking medication for. And you're currently covered by Medicare. Thank you for letting me know. Now, have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… Hmm. Let me think… No. Not that I recall. Maybe when I was a kid, somethin’ small, but I don’t remember it. Definitely nothin’ as an adult. Never needed nothin’ taken out or put in. Just the usual scrapes and bruises, you know? Workin' on the power lines, things happen. But no real surgeries. Does that matter?
DOCTOR: No, that’s perfectly fine, Mr. Reyno. It's helpful to know either way. Now, can you tell me about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history… That's a tough one. My folks… they’re gone now, been gone a long time. Lots of heart trouble on my mom’s side, I think. And my dad… he smoked too. A lot. He got sick, real sick, towards the end. Couldn't breathe. But that was a long time ago. Didn’t see much of either of ‘em, to be honest. Reservation life, you know? Folks moved on. Not much help, I reckon.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Reyno. It's helpful to know about the history of heart trouble and your father's smoking. It gives us some clues. Now, do you currently take any medications, besides what you used to take for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Nope. Not a one. Stopped takin' the blood pressure pills years ago. Just… ibuprofen, sometimes, for my back. When it really acts up. But that's it. Mostly try to tough it out. Old man stuff, right? I don't like takin' pills, if I can help it.
DOCTOR: Alright, just ibuprofen as needed for back pain. Now, have you ever had any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… Not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything, not that I recall. Sometimes get a little itchy when I’m around cats, but that's about it. Not a real allergy, just… a little sniffle. Never been to the hospital for an allergic reaction or nothin’. Pretty lucky, I guess.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. Now, I'm going to ask about your social history, if that’s alright. Do you drink alcohol, or use any tobacco products other than cigarettes?
PATIENT: Yeah, alright. Well, Doc, you already know about the cigarettes. Been smokin' since I was a kid, like a dummy. Maybe a beer every now and then, with the boys. Not much, though. Used to drink more, back in the day. But not anymore. Keeps me coughin’ worse. No other drugs, nothin’ like that. Just the smokes. Bad habit, I know.
DOCTOR: Thank you for being honest, Mr. Reyno. It’s important information. Now, I'd like to perform a physical exam, if you’re comfortable with that. I’ll listen to your lungs, check your heart, and take a look at your overall health. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, alright. Go ahead. Don’t expect much, though. Old man’s body, you know? Lots of wear and tear. But go ahead, Doc. Get it over with. I got things to do.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’ll be as quick as possible. Please take a deep breath for me… and exhale slowly. Okay… I’m hearing some wheezing in both lungs, and some crackles as well. This is consistent with some inflammation or fluid buildup. Heart sounds are a bit muffled, and I detect a slight irregularity in the rhythm. I’ll need to investigate that further. Blood pressure is elevated – 150/90. Pulse is 88 and irregular. Chest is tender to palpation in a few areas. Abdomen is soft, no significant masses or tenderness. Okay, Mr. Reyno. Based on what I'm hearing and feeling, I think we need to run some tests to get a better understanding of what's going on. I'd like to order a chest X-ray and some blood work, including a complete blood count and a metabolic panel. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Tests… yeah, alright. Sounds good. Get it done. X-ray, blood work… whatever you need to do, Doc. Just… get it over with. I got things to do, like I said. When can I get the results? I don’t wanna be comin’ back here a dozen times.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern about the time commitment, Mr. Reyno. We can usually get the X-ray results back within a few hours, and the blood work typically takes 24-48 hours. I’ll have my nurse call you as soon as we have the results. In the meantime, I'd like to ask you to try and avoid any strenuous activity. And if your cough gets significantly worse, or you develop a fever, or experience any chest pain, please come back to the clinic immediately or go to the nearest emergency room. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Questions… No, I reckon not. Just… what do you think it is, Doc? Be honest. Is it somethin’ bad? I ain't afraid to hear it, long as I know what I’m dealin’ with.
DOCTOR: Mr. Reyno, it's too early to say definitively what's going on until we get the results of the tests. However, given your history of smoking, your symptoms of a chronic cough with red sputum, shortness of breath, and the findings on my physical exam – wheezing, crackles, and an irregular heart rhythm – there are a few possibilities we need to consider. One possibility is chronic bronchitis or emphysema, which are common in smokers. Another is pneumonia. And, unfortunately, we also need to rule out more serious conditions, such as lung cancer. I want to emphasize that these are just possibilities. The tests will help us narrow down the diagnosis and determine the best course of treatment. It’s important not to jump to conclusions. We’ll take things one step at a time. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Cancer… I figured as much. My dad… he got it too. Terrible way to go. Alright. Tests it is. Just… get it done quick, Doc. I don’t wanna sit around worryin’ about it. And call me as soon as you know somethin’. Don't keep me in the dark. I guess that’s all. Thanks, Doc. .
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Reyno. We will do everything we can to get you answers as quickly as possible. My nurse will schedule the tests for you before you leave. And I will personally call you as soon as we have the results. Please don’t hesitate to call the clinic if you have any concerns or questions in the meantime. Take care, Mr. Reyno. .
