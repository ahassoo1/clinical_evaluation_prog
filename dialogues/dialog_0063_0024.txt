DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Ms. Sayar. I am Dr. Jules. Now, please, let’s not waste time. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Right, Dr. Jules. Thank you. I need a letter. A letter confirming that I'm able to fly. It’s for… well, for a trip I'm planning, and the airline needs it. It’s a bit of a last-minute thing, so that’s why I’m here.
DOCTOR: A letter confirming you’re able to fly… Yes, well, that requires an examination, Ms. Sayar. We can’t simply state someone is fit for travel without assessing them. It would be… irresponsible. Now, do you have any pre-existing medical conditions I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No, not really. Nothing major, anyway. I had a bit of a cold last winter, but that cleared up ages ago. Oh… and my husband passed away last year. It was… sudden. But as far as ongoing health issues go, I’m pretty healthy. I try to eat well, and I walk a lot. Does that help?
DOCTOR: A cold… and bereavement. While I sympathize with your loss, Ms. Sayar, these are not typically conditions requiring a medical certificate for air travel. Still, we must be thorough. Have you experienced any symptoms recently – even minor ones – that might be relevant?
PATIENT: Relevant… hmm. Well, now that you mention it, I've been a little more tired than usual, maybe? And a bit breathless going up the stairs. But honestly, I thought that was just… getting older. I’m not exactly young anymore, and it’s been a stressful year. It’s probably nothing. I really don't want to make a fuss.
DOCTOR: “Probably nothing” is not a medical diagnosis, Ms. Sayar. Breathlessness, even with minimal exertion, warrants investigation. And fatigue… well, that is rather vague. Do you have any chest pain?
PATIENT: No, no chest pain. Definitely not. And I haven’t coughed or anything like that. It's just… a feeling of being worn out, and a little out of breath. It doesn’t happen all the time, honestly. It’s more when I push myself. Like if I walk a long distance. Or carry something heavy. It's not crippling or anything. Just... noticeable. Is this going to take long? I have a flight to catch, you see.
DOCTOR: We are trying to determine if you are safe to fly, Ms. Sayar, not simply to expedite a trip. I need to perform a basic examination. Please, if you’ll sit up and I’ll listen to your heart and lungs. And, if you don’t mind, I’d like to check your blood pressure and oxygen saturation. It will only take a few moments.
PATIENT: Alright, alright. Fine. Do what you need to do. But please, be quick. My flight leaves on the 5th.
DOCTOR: Take a deep breath… and exhale. Again. Hmm. Your heart rate is a little elevated, and your breathing sounds… slightly diminished on the left side. Blood pressure is 138/85. Oxygen saturation is 96%, which is acceptable, but not optimal. Now, tell me, have you experienced any swelling in your ankles or feet recently?
PATIENT: Swelling? Not really. Maybe a little, after a long day, but I figured that was just… standing too much. I do a lot of walking, like I said. I hadn’t thought anything of it. Is something wrong? You're looking worried.
DOCTOR: "Not really" is still not a helpful answer, Ms. Sayar. Diminished breath sounds and elevated heart rate, coupled with potential lower extremity edema… it is not conclusive, but it warrants further investigation. Do you have a history of blood clots?
PATIENT: Blood clots? No! No, I’ve never had blood clots. Not that I know of, anyway. I’ve never been in the hospital for anything serious. Just the usual check-ups. My husband always handled the medical stuff… I never really paid much attention.
DOCTOR: Ms. Sayar, I’m going to order a chest X-ray and an EKG. It’s standard procedure given your symptoms and lack of comprehensive medical history. I cannot, in good conscience, issue a certificate for air travel without these tests. It would be… negligent. Do you understand?
PATIENT: An X-ray… and an EKG? Oh, for goodness sake. That’s going to take hours, isn’t it? My flight… I don’t know if I can do that. Is there absolutely no other way? Can’t you just… write something saying I'm generally healthy? I feel fine, honestly!
DOCTOR: Ms. Sayar, "feeling fine" is not a substitute for a proper medical evaluation. I understand your frustration, but I am obligated to ensure your safety. Air travel can exacerbate underlying conditions. I cannot compromise my professional judgment. The X-ray and EKG are essential. I will expedite the process as much as possible, but there is no shortcut. Do you wish to proceed with the tests, or would you prefer to reschedule your flight?
PATIENT: Fine. Fine, do the tests. But please, please hurry. And can you… can you tell me how long it will take? And where do I go? This is just… a lot.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’ve sent the referral to the radiology department. They are located on the third floor, just past the cafeteria. The EKG will be done in the same department, immediately following the X-ray. It should take approximately one to two hours, depending on their workload. I will review the results as soon as they are available. In the meantime, please remain in the waiting area. Do not leave. And, Ms. Sayar, if you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath, or dizziness, inform a nurse immediately. Is that understood?
PATIENT: Yes. Understood. Thank you… I think.
