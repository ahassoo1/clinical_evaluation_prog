DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Pitzel. Welcome. I'm Dr. Smetak. It’s nice to meet you. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s very nice to meet you as well. Well, to be frank, I feel…stuck. Like I need a bit of a…reset, I suppose. A jumpstart. I’m not really sure how to explain it beyond that. I just don’t feel like myself lately.
DOCTOR: "Stuck," alright. And you say you don't feel like yourself… can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. It's hard to pinpoint exactly. I have less energy than usual, even though I'm sleeping alright, I think. And…well, I just don't have the drive to do the things I used to enjoy. My work, even... it feels like a chore now, and I usually love my work. I shape and cast things, you know? It’s usually very fulfilling. Now…not so much. It’s a bit discouraging.
DOCTOR: Less energy, loss of interest in things you typically enjoy… and you mentioned this is affecting your work. Hmm. Has this been happening gradually, or did it come on suddenly?
PATIENT: Gradually, I think. It wasn't a sudden thing, no. Maybe…over the last six months or so? It started small, just feeling a bit more tired than usual. Then it slowly…worsened. I didn’t really notice it happening, to be honest. It just…was. It’s difficult to say precisely when it started, because it was so…subtle.
DOCTOR: Six months… that's helpful. And aside from the fatigue and loss of interest, have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Let me think… I’ve been a little more forgetful, perhaps? Nothing major, just…misplacing things, or struggling to recall a name right away. And…oh, this might be silly, but I haven’t been sleeping as soundly, even though I said I was. I wake up a few times during the night, usually just for a few minutes, but it's enough to make me feel…not quite rested. I don't know if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, Ms. Pitzel. It's important to mention everything, even if it seems small. Forgetfulness and disrupted sleep… alright. Have you experienced any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: Now that you mention it…my appetite hasn’t been quite the same. I’m not eating less, exactly, but I don't feel hungry as often. And I think…yes, I’ve lost a little weight, maybe five or ten pounds? It’s not intentional, and I haven’t been trying to diet or anything. It just seems to have…come off.
DOCTOR: Okay. And how about your mood?
PATIENT: That’s…a difficult question. I wouldn’t say I’m sad, exactly. More…flat, I suppose? Less interested in things. Not as joyful as I usually am. I wouldn't describe myself as depressed, but I definitely don't feel like my usual self. My husband has noticed, too. He says I’m quieter than usual. It’s just…a general lack of…spark, I think.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Pitzel. Thank you for sharing all of that. That gives me a good starting point. Now, just to get a more complete picture, could you tell me a little about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Certainly. I’ve generally been quite healthy, thankfully. I had the usual childhood illnesses, but nothing serious. I was diagnosed with high blood pressure about ten years ago, but it’s been well-managed with medication ever since. And I had a hysterectomy about fifteen years ago. Other than that…not much. No major surgeries or chronic illnesses. I’m on Medicare, so I see a doctor regularly for check-ups. Is there anything specific you’d like to know?
DOCTOR: High blood pressure, managed with medication, and a hysterectomy fifteen years ago. That’s good to know. Do you know what medication you take for your blood pressure, if you don’t mind me asking?
PATIENT: Let me think…it’s Lisinopril, I believe. Yes, Lisinopril. And I take 20 milligrams every day. I get a refill every three months from Dr. Ramirez. He's a good doctor, but he's very busy, and I feel like I haven’t been able to discuss all of this with him properly. That's why I made an appointment with you, actually.
DOCTOR: Lisinopril 20mg daily. Okay, that’s helpful. And do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I’m aware of. I haven’t had any allergic reactions to anything, thankfully. I can eat pretty much anything, and I haven’t had any problems with medications in the past. I’ve taken antibiotics and pain relievers without any issues. It’s one of the few things I don’t have to worry about, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Good. Alright, Ms. Pitzel. Now, before we move on, I’d like to ask about your family history. Have there been any significant illnesses in your family, like heart disease, cancer, or mental health conditions?
PATIENT: That's a bit complicated. My mother had diabetes, and she passed away from a heart attack when she was in her seventies. My father had high blood pressure, similar to me, and he lived to be eighty-five. On my husband’s side, his mother had Alzheimer’s disease. And his brother…he struggled with depression for many years. It’s not a particularly cheerful medical history, I'm afraid. Does that answer your question?
DOCTOR: It does, thank you. Diabetes, heart disease, Alzheimer's, and a history of depression… alright. Now, just a few more questions, then I'd like to do a brief physical exam, if you're comfortable with that. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, I don't smoke. I used to drink a glass of wine with dinner occasionally, but I stopped a few months ago. I just didn’t enjoy it as much, and I figured it was best to cut back. And no, I definitely don’t use any recreational drugs. Never have. I prefer a good cup of coffee, if that counts! I'm quite a sensible person, really.
DOCTOR: A sensible person, yes. Coffee absolutely counts. Alright, Ms. Pitzel, that gives me a good overview. Now, if you’re comfortable, I’d like to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure and pulse, and do a quick neurological exam. Just to get a better feel for things. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly alright, Doctor. Please, go ahead. I trust your judgment, and I want to do whatever I can to figure out what’s going on. I'm ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Alright. Blood pressure is 135/85, a bit elevated, but not drastically so. Pulse is 72 and regular. Heart sounds are normal, no murmurs. Lungs are clear, good air movement on both sides. Reflexes are normal, balance is good. No obvious neurological deficits. Everything appears within normal limits physically, Ms. Pitzel. Now, based on everything you've told me, and the brief exam, it sounds like you may be experiencing symptoms of depression. It's important to note, I can’t provide a definitive diagnosis without some further investigation, perhaps some blood work to rule out other conditions, like thyroid problems or vitamin deficiencies. But your symptoms—fatigue, loss of interest, sleep disturbances, changes in appetite and weight, forgetfulness, and a flat mood—are all consistent with depression. What are your thoughts?
PATIENT: That…doesn’t entirely surprise me, to be honest. I hadn’t really considered depression before, but when you explain it like that…it does sound like me. It’s…disconcerting, to think of it that way. I always thought depression was something other people experienced, not…me. I’ve always been a strong, independent person. What kind of further investigation are you thinking of? And…what happens if it is depression? I’ve never been one for taking medication, but I'm willing to consider anything if it will help me feel like myself again.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly normal to feel surprised or hesitant, Ms. Pitzel. Depression can affect anyone, regardless of their strength or independence. As for the investigation, I'd like to order a complete blood count, a thyroid panel, and a vitamin D level. These tests will help rule out any underlying medical conditions that could be contributing to your symptoms. If these tests come back normal, then we can discuss treatment options. Those options include therapy, medication, or a combination of both. There are many different types of therapy available, such as cognitive behavioral therapy, which can help you identify and change negative thought patterns. And if medication is something you’re open to, there are many different antidepressants available, with varying side effects. We can work together to find a treatment plan that’s right for you. Would you be comfortable with those blood tests?
PATIENT: Yes, I think that sounds reasonable. Blood tests are fine. If it helps to rule things out, or to get a better understanding of what's happening, then I'm happy to do them. When can I get those done? And…how long will it take to get the results? I'm a little anxious, to be honest, but I appreciate you explaining everything so thoroughly. It makes me feel a little less…lost.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent. The lab is just down the hall, and you can go at your convenience today. The results usually take 2-3 business days to come back. Once I have them, I’ll give you a call to discuss them and schedule a follow-up appointment. In the meantime, I want to assure you that you’re not alone in this, Ms. Pitzel. Many people experience depression, and there is help available. If you find yourself feeling overwhelmed or having thoughts of harming yourself, please don’t hesitate to reach out to a crisis hotline or emergency services. I can provide you with some resources if you’d like. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so, Doctor. That’s all very helpful, and I appreciate you being so kind and understanding. I will remember the resources, just in case. Thank you for taking the time to listen to me, and for not dismissing my concerns. I feel much better knowing there are options, and that I’m not just…making things up in my head. I think I’ll go get those blood tests done now. Thank you again, Doctor Smetak.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Pitzel. I’m glad I could help. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. Take care, and I look forward to speaking with you soon. .
PATIENT: .
