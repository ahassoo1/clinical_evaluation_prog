DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Popova. I’m Dr. Nooruddin. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning to you too, Doctor. Aldine Popova, pleased to meet ya. Well, it's this headache I’ve been gettin’. Right at the back of me head, ya know? Been botherin’ me for a little bit now. Not constant, comes and goes.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Popova. A headache, you say. At the back of your head, coming and going. How long has this been going on, roughly?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think now. It started… oh, maybe about three weeks ago? Hard to say exactly, time flies when you’re enjoyin’ life! But definitely around three weeks. It weren’t bad at first, just a little niggle. Now it’s… noticeable, if that makes sense. Especially when I’m bendin’ over doin’ someone’s toes.
DOCTOR: “Bendin’ over doin’ someone’s toes?
PATIENT: Ah, yes! I’m a manicurist, Doctor. And pedicurist. Been doin’ nails for… oh, goodness, nearly sixty years now! Lots of bendin’ and lookin’ down, ya see. Mostly ladies, but I get a few gentlemen now and then. A good pedicure can fix anything, I always say. But this headache… it’s makin’ it harder to concentrate, if you get me.
DOCTOR: Sixty years… that’s impressive. And a lot of bending, as you say. So the headache seems to be worse when you're actively working, doing pedicures?
PATIENT: Mostly pedicures, yes. Manicures aren’t so bad, I’m sittin’ more. But with the pedicures, stretchin’ and reachin’… that’s when it really flares up. Sometimes it'll last a good hour after I finish a client too. It’s just… a dull ache, nothin’ sharp or anything. More like a pressure, right at the base of me skull.
DOCTOR: Alright, a dull ache, pressure at the base of the skull, worse with pedicures… Have you noticed anything else that makes it better or worse?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Layin’ down seems to help, definitely. And a cool cloth on the back of me neck. Warmth doesn’t help, no. And stress… well, a busy day at the salon always seems to make it worse. Not that I get stressed, mind ya! But lots of customers and chatter… it does wear a fella down. I do try to take breaks, though. A little tea and a biscuit does wonders.
DOCTOR: Tea and biscuits are good medicine. Alright. And have you had any other symptoms at all?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… well, now that you mention it, me eyesight’s been a little blurry sometimes. Not all the time, just… now and then. I put it down to me age, to be honest. I’m 87, ya know! Things aren’t as sharp as they used to be. But it does happen more when the headache’s bad. And… oh, sometimes me neck feels a little stiff too. Not terrible, just… tight. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Blurry vision, neck stiffness… alright. Have you noticed any nausea or vomiting with the headaches?
PATIENT: No, no nausea or vomitin’ at all, thank goodness! Never had that with these headaches. Just the ache, the blurry vision, and the tight neck. And the tiredness, of course. A headache does drain ya, doesn't it? I’m a bit of a worrier too, always have been, so I’m hopin’ it’s not somethin’ serious. I still got customers dependin’ on me!
DOCTOR: Alright, no nausea or vomiting. Let's do a quick physical exam, Mr. Popova, just to get a better picture of what’s going on. Could you please sit up straight for me?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Straight as a board! Though me back might complain a little. Sixty years of bendin’ over, remember?
DOCTOR: Alright. And does this hurt at all?
PATIENT: Ooh, yes, there's a bit of tenderness there, Doctor. Not sharp, just… a dull ache, like the headache itself. Especially right… here. Feels a bit knotted too, if you get me? Like there’s a tight band around me head.
DOCTOR: Alright. And can you turn your head to the left for me, please?
PATIENT: There we go… a little stiff, Doctor. Not terrible, but definitely not as smooth as it used to be. Feels a bit… restricted. Like somethin’s holdin’ it back.
DOCTOR: And now to the right, please.
PATIENT: Same on this side, Doctor. A bit of resistance. And a little click when I turn it too. Don't worry, I've had that click for years! But it doesn't feel quite right. Not as smooth as it should be. I think all this bendin’ over has taken its toll.
DOCTOR: Alright. And your blood pressure is a little elevated today, 148/92. But that could be due to being in the office. Everything else sounds… normal. Based on what you’ve told me and the exam, it sounds like you’re likely experiencing tension headaches, possibly related to the strain from your work as a manicurist and pedicurist. The neck stiffness and elevated blood pressure could also be contributing.
PATIENT: Tension headaches, eh? That sounds… reasonable, Doctor. I figured all that bendin’ and reachin’ couldn't be good for me! So what do I do about it? Is there somethin’ I can take? I don’t want to give up me work, ya know! Customers dependin' on me!
DOCTOR: I understand completely. We don't want to give up your work. For now, we can try some conservative measures. I recommend over-the-counter pain relievers, like ibuprofen or acetaminophen, as needed. But don't take them every day, as they can have side effects. Also, try applying a warm compress to your neck and shoulders. Most importantly, let's focus on proper posture and ergonomics when you're working. Are you able to adjust your chair or table to a more comfortable height?
PATIENT: Hmm, a warm compress… that sounds nice. And I do have some ibuprofen at home, so that's good. Proper posture… that's the tricky part, Doctor. I try to sit up straight, but after a while, I just slump, ya know? The chair's alright, but the table... well, it's a bit low, I think. I've been meanin' to get a higher one, but… things always come up. I do try to take breaks, though! A little tea and a biscuit does wonders for a tired back.
DOCTOR: Alright. A higher table would definitely be beneficial. And while the tea and biscuit are good for morale, they won't fix the underlying issue. We can also discuss some simple stretching exercises to help relieve tension in your neck and shoulders. However, given your age and slightly elevated blood pressure, I'd like to rule out anything more serious. I'm going to order some blood work to check your thyroid function and look for any signs of inflammation. And I think it would be a good idea to get a quick check of your vision from an optometrist, just to be sure everything's okay there. Would you be able to schedule those appointments?
PATIENT: Blood work and a vision check… alright, that sounds sensible, Doctor. I don’t mind gettin’ checked out. Better safe than sorry, as they say. I can schedule those appointments, yes. My daughter, she's good with things like that. She’ll call the clinic and get everything sorted out. So, for now, ibuprofen, warm compress, try to sit up straighter… and a higher table. Anything else I should be doin’, or lookin’ out for? I don't want to miss anythin’ important!
DOCTOR: If the headaches worsen suddenly, or if you develop any new symptoms, such as fever, weakness, numbness, or difficulty speaking, please go to the emergency room immediately. Those would be signs of something more serious. Also, try to manage your stress levels as much as possible. Easier said than done, I know, but stress can definitely exacerbate tension headaches. We’ll review the blood work and vision check results at your next appointment, and we can adjust the treatment plan accordingly. I’m not overly concerned at this point, but it’s always best to be thorough. Do you have any questions for me?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything, Doctor. Sudden worsening, new symptoms… got it. And try to manage stress… easier said than done, you’re right! But I'll try. Thank you for takin’ the time to listen to me, and for not makin’ me feel like I’m just an old man complainin’. I appreciate your help. I'll get those appointments scheduled and I'll see you at the next one. Have a good day, Doctor Nooruddin.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Popova. It was my pleasure. And please, don’t hesitate to call the clinic if you have any concerns before your next appointment. Take care of yourself, and try to enjoy your tea and biscuits. Have a good day as well.
