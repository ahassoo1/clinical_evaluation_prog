DOCTOR: Alright, Mrs. Ranells, let's get this over with. You're 74, Dominican… right. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, yes, that is correct. And I assure you, Doctor, I am quite aware of my age. It’s simply…a formality, I suppose. My husband and I were discussing, and we believe… a little marijuana might be helpful. For… certain discomforts. I wouldn’t want to bore you with the details, but it’s causing a bit of a nuisance. I understand you can certify one for it these days?
DOCTOR: Marijuana, huh?
PATIENT: Yes. I’ve heard it’s… quite effective. And far more dignified than some of the… other remedies people suggest. Honestly, Doctor, I’ve always been a very… composed woman. I wouldn’t be here if I didn’t think this was a sensible solution. My cousin’s daughter’s friend’s husband… he uses it for his back, and he’s doing wonderfully. Though, of course, one must be discerning. Not all strains are created equal, I presume?
DOCTOR: Look, Mrs. Ranells, with all due respect, I’m a real doctor. I went to medical school. I’m not here to discuss anecdotal evidence from your cousin’s daughter’s friend’s husband. We deal with actual medicine here. But… fine. Let's get this over with. What "discomforts" are we talking about?
PATIENT: Well! I find your tone rather… condescending, Doctor. However, I suppose I should explain. It’s… my joints, primarily. The arthritis, you see. It’s mostly in my hands and knees. It makes… simple tasks rather difficult. Gardening, for instance. I used to have a beautiful rose garden. Now… it’s quite a struggle. And the evenings are the worst. A great deal of aching, and difficulty… resting. Is that sufficient detail for your “actual medicine,” Doctor?
DOCTOR: Arthritis… hands and knees. How long have you been experiencing this?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Years, really. It comes and goes, you know? But it’s been… persistently worse these past two years. I initially dismissed it as simply… getting older. One expects a certain amount of wear and tear, naturally. But it’s begun to interfere with my…quality of life. I haven’t been able to properly host my bridge club for months. And that, Doctor, is a serious matter.
DOCTOR: Bridge club, huh?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. My bridge club. A very reputable gathering. We’ve been meeting for… decades. It’s a social obligation, you see. And frankly, it's becoming increasingly difficult to concentrate when one is… distracted by discomfort. It requires a certain level of mental acuity, you understand. Not everyone is capable of playing a decent hand.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. Any other medical problems?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, I wouldn’t say problems. I have… a touch of high blood pressure, but it’s well-managed with a small dose of medication. And my eyesight isn’t what it used to be, naturally, but I wear glasses. As I mentioned, I’m 74. A few… minor ailments are to be expected. I assure you, Doctor, I’m not a fragile creature. I simply require a bit of… relief to maintain my usual standards. Do you require a full medical history? It might take some time, I’ve seen many doctors over the years.
DOCTOR: No, no. Just the blood pressure. What medication are you on for that?
PATIENT: Lisinopril. A very small dose, as I said. Ten milligrams. I’ve been on it for… oh, five years, perhaps? My previous physician prescribed it. A perfectly competent man, though he moved to Florida. Terribly humid there, I hear. It simply wouldn’t suit me. I prefer a dry climate. Now, are we getting anywhere with this certification? My husband is rather relying on me to… investigate this thoroughly. He’s always been a very practical man.
DOCTOR: Lisinopril, 10mg… Alright. Any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Hmm. Allergies… let me see. Not to my knowledge, Doctor. I’ve had penicillin, of course, as a child. And various inoculations over the years. I’ve never experienced any… untoward reactions. Though, I did have a slight rash once, after using a particular brand of hand cream. But I suspect that was simply… a poor quality product. I’m very particular about skincare, you see. One must maintain a certain standard, even at my age. Are we finished with the… interrogations?
DOCTOR: Fine. Let’s do a quick exam. Just to… satisfy the requirements. Stand up.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. Though I must say, I’m not entirely certain what you expect to find. Arthritis is a rather… visible condition, you see. I assure you, my joints are not going to magically improve during a brief examination. But I shall cooperate, of course. Just… please be gentle. I wouldn't want to exacerbate the discomfort. And do try to keep the room warm. A chill can be quite… detrimental.
DOCTOR: Knees… a little creaky. Range of motion is limited. Not surprising. Hands… some swelling, tenderness on the knuckles. Alright. Decreased range of motion in bilateral knees, mild swelling and tenderness in metacarpophalangeal joints. So. Marijuana. It’s… not ideal. But I suppose I can sign off on it. There are forms to fill out. The dispensary will need them.
PATIENT: Excellent, Doctor. I am most relieved to hear that. I knew you would come to a sensible conclusion. And I appreciate your… thoroughness, despite your initial reservations. Forms, you say? I shall fill them out meticulously, of course. I always pay close attention to detail. Now, if you could direct me to the appropriate paperwork, I shall commence immediately. And perhaps you could recommend a reputable dispensary? My husband values your expertise. A well-informed choice is paramount, you understand.
DOCTOR: There. Just fill those out. As for dispensaries… I don’t keep a list. Look online. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have other patients waiting. .
PATIENT: Oh. Very well, Doctor. A rather… abrupt dismissal, but I suppose I shouldn’t expect personalized service these days. I shall locate the forms and proceed accordingly. And I shall rely on my own discretion in selecting a suitable dispensary. I have always been a resourceful woman. Honestly, the lack of professionalism is quite appalling…
