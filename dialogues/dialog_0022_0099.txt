DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Denis. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Tosca. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon to you as well, Doctor Tosca. It is nice to meet you too. Well, I received a letter regarding some… unusual results from a test I had done on my stomach. An “GI Endo Test,” it was called. I’m not entirely certain what that means, but the letter suggested I come in for a discussion. I’ve been feeling alright, generally, but I do worry when I receive official-looking paperwork about things I don’t understand.
DOCTOR: Okay, Denis, that’s perfectly understandable. It's good you came in to discuss it. “GI Endo Test” likely refers to an upper endoscopy, a procedure where we use a small camera to look inside your esophagus, stomach, and duodenum – the first part of your small intestine. To help me understand what's going on, and to make sure we cover everything, could you tell me a little more about why you had the endoscopy done in the first place?
PATIENT: Ah, yes, that clarifies things a bit. A camera… I remember now, the preparation was… not pleasant. As to why I had it done… my regular physician, Dr. Ramirez, ordered it. I had been experiencing some discomfort – a burning sensation, mostly, in my upper abdomen, and a feeling of fullness rather quickly when I eat. It wasn’t constant, and initially I dismissed it as simply getting older, but it persisted. Dr. Ramirez wanted to rule out anything serious, and that led to the test. She also mentioned something about checking for… ulcers, I believe she called them. It's all a bit blurry now.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful. So, burning sensation and early fullness – those are definitely things we want to investigate. And Dr. Ramirez was right to check for ulcers, amongst other things. Could you describe the burning sensation for me?
PATIENT: Certainly. It's… not a sharp pain, Doctor. More of a warm, uncomfortable feeling, localized right here, in the upper middle of my stomach. It often occurs after I eat, though not every time. And it doesn’t radiate – it stays put, thankfully. Sometimes it’s mild enough to ignore, other times it’s… noticeable. It doesn't interfere with my sleep, but it can be irritating when I'm trying to relax. Perhaps like a slow ember glowing. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that does make sense – a slow ember is a good way to describe it. And it’s good to know it’s localized and doesn't disrupt your sleep. Now, regarding the early fullness – how soon after starting to eat do you feel full?
PATIENT: Well, that's… rather discouraging to admit. Even with small portions, sometimes after only a few bites. It’s as if my stomach doesn't have much room. It’s not a painful fullness, mind you, more… an uncomfortable pressure. And it doesn’t seem to matter what I eat. Soup, salad, even something light like a piece of fruit can trigger it. It's become quite frustrating, frankly. It makes enjoying meals rather difficult, and I have always enjoyed a good meal with friends.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Denis. It definitely sounds disruptive to your quality of life. Okay, looking at the report here… it indicates some mild inflammation in your stomach lining, and they found a small area that appears to be a gastric ulcer. It's relatively small, but it is present. This likely explains both the burning sensation and the early fullness. Before we discuss treatment options, I want to be thorough. Have you been experiencing any other symptoms at all?
PATIENT: An ulcer… Oh dear. That sounds… serious. Other symptoms… Let me think. I have noticed… some fatigue, recently. Not debilitating, but I tire more easily than I used to. And… occasionally, a bit of nausea, though I haven't actually been sick. And… this is a bit embarrassing to admit, but my stools have been a little darker than usual. A sort of… blackish hue. Could that be related?
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for sharing all of that, Denis. It’s good you mentioned the fatigue, nausea, and especially the dark stools. Dark stools can be a sign of bleeding in the upper gastrointestinal tract, which could be related to the ulcer. It’s important we investigate that further. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Do you have any other medical conditions?
PATIENT: Yes, certainly. I was diagnosed with mild hypertension—high blood pressure—several years ago. It is usually well-controlled with medication, though I do occasionally forget to take it, I must admit. I also had a bout of bronchitis last winter, but that resolved completely with antibiotics. Other than that… nothing significant, I believe. I have always been rather healthy, despite my age. I was a metalworker for many years, so I was fairly active.
DOCTOR: Okay, hypertension, well-controlled, but with occasional lapses in medication adherence – noted. And the bronchitis is good to know. Now, are you currently taking any medications, besides the one for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Yes, I am. As I mentioned, there is amlodipine for the blood pressure. I also take a daily multivitamin, just to keep things… balanced. And I sometimes use ibuprofen for aches and pains, particularly when the weather is damp. But that’s it, I believe. You are welcome to examine the bottles, if you wish.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Denis. Okay, so amlodipine, a multivitamin, and occasional ibuprofen. It’s important to be aware of the ibuprofen, as frequent use can sometimes irritate the stomach lining and potentially worsen ulcers. Now, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I do not. I have never experienced any allergic reactions to any medications, foods, or anything else, thankfully. I have a rather robust constitution, I suppose. My mother always said I was a strong child, and I’ve always been able to tolerate most things. But thank you for asking. It is wise to be thorough.
DOCTOR: That's good to know, Denis. Okay, so to summarize, we have a small gastric ulcer, mild inflammation, symptoms of burning, early fullness, fatigue, occasional nausea, dark stools, hypertension well-controlled but with occasional lapses, and occasional ibuprofen use. Given the findings, I recommend the following. First, we need to confirm the source of the dark stools and rule out any significant bleeding. I’m going to order a complete blood count and a stool test. Second, to protect your stomach lining, I’m going to prescribe a proton pump inhibitor – a medication that reduces stomach acid. Third, please stop taking the ibuprofen immediately. Do you have any questions about any of that?
PATIENT: That… sounds rather comprehensive, Doctor. And a bit worrying, if I am honest. A PPI… and stopping the ibuprofen. I can certainly do that. What exactly is a proton pump inhibitor? And what if the blood test shows… significant bleeding? What would that entail? I suppose I am mostly concerned about the blood tests. And… will the medication have any side effects? I do not wish to simply trade one discomfort for another.
DOCTOR: Those are all excellent questions, Denis, and it’s good you’re asking them. A proton pump inhibitor, or PPI, works by reducing the amount of acid your stomach produces. This allows the ulcer to heal and prevents further irritation. Common side effects are generally mild – things like headache, diarrhea, or constipation. Serious side effects are rare. Regarding the blood tests, the complete blood count will check your hemoglobin and hematocrit levels. If they are low, it could indicate bleeding. If significant bleeding is detected, we may need to consider an endoscopy to find the source and potentially stop the bleeding with cautery or medication. It sounds more alarming than it often is, and most ulcers are manageable with medication. We would discuss all options in detail if that becomes necessary. I want to assure you we’re taking a proactive approach to address this. We're starting with the least invasive measures – medication and monitoring. Do you have any other concerns I can address at this point?
PATIENT: That… does sound more manageable when you explain it that way, Doctor. Cautery… that sounds a bit frightening, but I understand the need to address bleeding if it is present. I think I mostly worry about the long-term implications. Will I need to be on this medication indefinitely? And… is there anything I should be doing differently with my diet? Are there foods I should avoid? I have always enjoyed cooking and eating, and I wouldn't want to deprive myself unnecessarily. I suppose, at my age, one wants to enjoy life’s simple pleasures.
DOCTOR: That's a very valid concern, Denis. We typically start with a course of PPI therapy for about 4-8 weeks. After that, we reassess. Many patients can successfully wean off the medication once the ulcer has healed, but some may need longer-term maintenance, especially if there are underlying factors contributing to the problem. We'll monitor your symptoms and adjust the treatment plan accordingly. Regarding diet, there's no strict diet required, but certain foods can exacerbate symptoms. It's generally best to avoid highly acidic foods like citrus fruits, tomatoes, and spicy foods. Also, caffeine and alcohol can irritate the stomach lining. Fatty foods can slow digestion, so it's best to limit those as well. Smaller, more frequent meals are often better tolerated than large meals. Ultimately, it's about finding what works best for you – paying attention to your body and avoiding foods that trigger symptoms. We can discuss a referral to a dietitian if you’d like more personalized guidance. Do you have any other questions, Denis?
PATIENT: A dietitian… that might be helpful, actually. I suppose it is best to have some professional guidance on the dietary aspect. No, I believe that covers most of my concerns for the moment, Doctor. You have been very thorough and… reassuring. I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything so clearly. I suppose I should schedule the blood tests then? And you will contact me with the results?
DOCTOR: Excellent. I'm glad I could alleviate some of your concerns. Yes, let’s go ahead and schedule the blood tests. The lab is just down the hall, and they’re expecting you. Once the results are in—typically within a few days—my nurse will contact you to schedule a follow-up appointment. At that appointment, we'll discuss the results and adjust the treatment plan if needed. I’ll also put in a referral for you to a registered dietitian, and they will contact you to schedule an appointment. Do you have any questions about the process for the blood tests or the dietitian referral?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so, Doctor. Everything seems quite straightforward. The lab is down the hall, and the dietitian will contact me. Thank you again for your time and patience. I feel much better informed, and… less anxious. I appreciate your kindness.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Denis. That’s what I’m here for. Please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any questions or concerns between now and your follow-up appointment. We're here to support you. Have a good day, and I look forward to seeing you again soon. .
PATIENT: It’s very kind of you, Doctor. I will do that. You have a good day as well. .
