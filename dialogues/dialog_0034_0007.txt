DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Reihner. My name is Dr. Seil. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s my back. It’s been painful. I’d like to get this sorted out quickly, if possible.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I understand you’re experiencing back pain and would like to get to the bottom of it as efficiently as we can. To help me understand what’s going on, could you tell me a little more about the pain?
PATIENT: It’s… a sharp pain, mostly. Lower back. It started about three weeks ago, I think. I was… erecting a fence, naturally. It felt like something just… shifted. It’s worse when I bend over, or try to lift anything heavy. Even twisting feels bad.
DOCTOR: Okay, a sharp pain in the lower back that began about three weeks ago while erecting a fence. That gives us a good starting point. You mentioned it feels like something shifted. Can you describe the location of the pain more precisely?
PATIENT: It’s… right across my lower back. Not on one side particularly, but… across. If you drew a line where my belt would sit, it’s mostly there. And it sometimes goes down into my hips a little, but not down my legs. Not yet, anyway. I don’t want it going down my legs.
DOCTOR: I understand. Across the lower back, around belt level, with some discomfort radiating into the hips, but not extending down the legs—at least not yet. That's helpful to know. Has anything made the pain better since it started?
PATIENT: Resting, mostly. When I’m not working, and just… sitting. And I’ve been taking some of those over-the-counter pain relievers. The white ones. Ibuprofen, I think. They help a little, but not for very long. And they don't seem to be working as well as they did at first.
DOCTOR: Okay, resting and ibuprofen provide some temporary relief, but the effectiveness is diminishing. I see. Now, let's talk about your overall health. Do you have any other medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Just… old age, I suppose. I had a bit of trouble with my blood pressure a few years back, but it’s been managed. Medicare keeps track of everything. My husband… well, my late husband… he had diabetes, but I don’t. Nothing else, really. I’m generally… sturdy. Until this back.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that. High blood pressure managed with Medicare’s assistance, and a family history of diabetes. That's good to know. Before we move on to a physical examination, could you tell me about any previous injuries to your back, or any surgeries you've had?
PATIENT: No surgeries. Never. And no… serious injuries to my back before this. I’ve pulled muscles before, working, naturally. But nothing like this. This feels… different. Deeper. And more… stuck. I’m not sure if that makes sense. I’ve been working with fences since I was a girl. I’m used to a little ache, but this isn’t a little ache.
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense, Ms. Reihner. You've described it very well. A deeper, more "stuck" feeling than previous muscle strains. Okay, with your permission, I’d like to perform a brief physical examination of your back to assess the range of motion, tenderness, and any neurological symptoms. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… sensible. Just… please be quick, if possible. I have work to get back to. I have a schedule.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I understand you'd like to be as efficient as possible. If you could lie face down on the examination table, that would be great. I’ll gently palpate your back to check for tenderness, and then we’ll work through some range of motion tests. Please let me know immediately if anything causes pain. Okay, Ms. Reihner, does this feel tender here?
PATIENT: Yes. Right… there. On the left side. And a little bit… higher up. It’s not a sharp pain right now, but it’s… uncomfortable. Like a dull ache, starting up. Please… not too hard.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see. Tenderness on the left side of your lower back, and a little higher up, with a dull ache starting up. I'm being very gentle. Now, I’m going to ask you to slowly bend backwards, as far as you comfortably can. Let me know when you feel pain.
PATIENT: Ow… right there. It’s… bad. Not a shooting pain, but… a locking feeling. Like something is blocking me. I can’t go much further. Please… stop. It feels worse now.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Reihner, I see. Locking sensation with backward bending, causing discomfort. I’m stopping immediately. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes and sensation in your legs, just to ensure there's no nerve compression. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes. As long as it’s quick. I’m starting to feel… stiff. And I really need to get back to work. I have a deadline, you see. A fence won’t build itself.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Ms. Reihner. We'll be as efficient as possible. Your reflexes are normal bilaterally, and sensation is intact. That's reassuring. Based on the physical examination and what you've told me, it appears you likely have a lumbar strain, potentially with some facet joint irritation. However, given the locking sensation you described, and to rule out anything more serious, I'd like to order a lumbar X-ray. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: X-ray? Is that necessary? I just want something for the pain. A muscle relaxer, maybe? I don’t want to spend all day in a hospital. I have a schedule, Doctor. A very tight schedule. Is there anything else I can do instead? Perhaps… a stronger pain reliever?
DOCTOR: I understand your concern about spending a long time at the hospital and disrupting your schedule, Ms. Reihner. An X-ray will help us rule out a fracture or other structural issues that could be causing the locking sensation. While a muscle relaxer and stronger pain reliever might provide some temporary relief, we need to know the underlying cause of the pain before prescribing those. We can try a course of conservative treatment—physical therapy, stronger anti-inflammatory medication, and pain management techniques—while we wait for the X-ray results. However, if the X-ray reveals something more serious, we'll need to adjust the treatment plan accordingly. Would you be comfortable with getting the X-ray, and then starting a trial of conservative management?
PATIENT: Fine. An X-ray. But please… make it quick. And can you write me something for the pain now? Just to get me through until the results come back. Something I can pick up at the pharmacy on my way home. I have a fence to finish, Doctor. A very important fence. And I’m losing daylight.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Reihner. I understand. I’ll order the lumbar X-ray right away. And I can prescribe a short course of naproxen, a stronger anti-inflammatory, to help manage the pain while we await the results. It should help reduce inflammation and provide some relief. I'll also give you a prescription for a muscle relaxant, cyclobenzaprine, to take at night if the muscle spasms become bothersome. I'll also provide a referral to a physical therapist who specializes in back pain. They can teach you exercises to strengthen your core and improve your posture, which will help prevent future injuries. Does that sound acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Yes. That sounds… adequate. Naproxen and the muscle relaxer. And the physical therapist. As long as they understand I have a schedule. I can’t be spending all day in therapy. I need to get back to work. Can I get the prescriptions now? I really need to be going.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Reihner. I’ve already entered the prescriptions into the system. Here are your prescriptions for naproxen and cyclobenzaprine. The physical therapy referral is also printed here, with their contact information. They will call you to schedule an appointment. I’ll also have the X-ray order sent to the radiology department. They will contact you to schedule the X-ray. Please let me know if you have any questions. And if the pain worsens significantly, or if you experience any numbness or weakness in your legs, please go to the emergency room immediately. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: No. I believe that’s all. Thank you, Doctor. I have a fence to build.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Reihner. I wish you a speedy recovery, and I hope you can get that fence built without further complications. Please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any concerns. Have a good day. .
