DOCTOR: Good morning, Lilyanna. I'm Dr. Alzoubi. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s a bit difficult to explain. I’ve been feeling unsteady, like I might fall. It’s been happening for a little while now, I think. Honestly, the details are… fuzzy. I apologize for that.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's alright. Fuzzy is okay. We can sort through it together. When you say "a little while," can you give me a rough estimate?
PATIENT: Hmm… perhaps a couple of months? It’s hard to say exactly. Things haven’t been… clear. My husband… he passed away about six months ago, and everything sort of blurred together after that, if that makes any sense. I’m sorry, I don’t mean to… ramble. It’s just difficult to pinpoint when this started.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Lilyanna. That’s a huge loss, and it's very common for things to feel…unsettled and unclear after something like that. Don’t apologize at all. We’ll take our time. So, this unsteadiness… is it constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It comes and goes, I believe. There are days when I feel perfectly fine, and then other days… it’s like the floor is tilting, or I’m on a boat. It doesn’t happen every day, but it’s enough to worry me. I work with… heavy machinery, you see. It’s a bit dangerous to be unsteady in that line of work.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. Working with heavy machinery definitely makes this something we need to investigate. Does anything specific seem to trigger the unsteadiness?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. I haven’t noticed a pattern, not really. Sometimes it happens when I’m walking, sometimes when I’m standing still. I… I don’t recall if it’s worse after exertion, or anything like that. It just… happens. I wish I could be more helpful, but my memory… it's not what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Alright. No need to apologize again, Lilyanna. We’ll get to the bottom of this. Let's talk a little bit about other things you've been experiencing. Have you noticed any dizziness along with the unsteadiness?
PATIENT: Dizziness… yes, sometimes. It's not a spinning sensation, exactly. More like… a lightness in my head? Like I might faint, but I haven’t actually fainted. It comes and goes with the unsteadiness, I think. They seem to happen together, most of the time. It’s difficult to be certain, though.
DOCTOR: Okay, lightness in the head along with the unsteadiness. Have you noticed any changes in your vision – blurry vision, double vision, or spots in your vision?
PATIENT: Now that you mention it… yes. Perhaps. I’ve been noticing things seem a little… less sharp? I thought it was just my eyes getting older, to be honest. I haven’t had my vision checked in a while. It’s not constant, and it’s not terribly noticeable, but yes, I think my vision has been a bit blurry at times. I don’t see double, though. Just… not as clear as it used to be.
DOCTOR: Okay, blurry vision is good to know. And you said it's been a little while since your last eye exam?
PATIENT: Yes, quite a while. I believe… over a year ago? Possibly two? My husband always handled those sorts of appointments, and… well, it’s been difficult keeping up with everything since he passed. I apologize. I feel like I’m just listing off vague recollections. I wish I could be more precise.
DOCTOR: It's alright, Lilyanna. We'll work with what we have. Let’s move on to other symptoms. Have you experienced any headaches, ringing in your ears, or any nausea or vomiting?
PATIENT: Headaches… yes, occasionally. Nothing terribly severe, just a dull ache, mostly behind my eyes. Ringing in my ears, no, I don’t think so. And no nausea or vomiting. No, thankfully. Just the unsteadiness, the dizziness, and the occasional headache. It’s… unsettling, to feel so off balance. It makes me anxious, to be honest. I worry about falling and getting hurt.
DOCTOR: Okay. Anxiety is certainly understandable given everything. Now, let’s talk a bit about your medical history. Do you have any known medical conditions?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. I… I don’t recall anything major. I’ve always been fairly healthy, I think. I had the usual childhood illnesses, but nothing serious. My husband always handled the medical records, and… I’m afraid I’m not very knowledgeable in that area. I do have private insurance, if that’s helpful? I apologize again for being so vague. I wish I could provide more information.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Lilyanna. Private insurance is helpful. We can certainly access your records with your permission. Let’s try to think. Have you ever been diagnosed with high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: No, I don't believe so. My husband always said my blood pressure was normal when he took me for check-ups. I… I don’t have any known history of diabetes or heart problems. I've never taken any medication for those conditions, if that helps. He was very diligent about my health, and he would have told me if anything was wrong. It’s just… everything feels so distant now. I’m sorry.
DOCTOR: Okay. And have you had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything in the past?
PATIENT: No, I haven't. I’ve been very fortunate, thankfully. No surgeries, no hospital stays. I had a… a difficult birth with my son, many years ago, but it wasn’t serious enough to require a hospital stay. Just… a long recovery at home. Other than that, no. I’ve always been… quite healthy, I think. I apologize for repeating myself. I feel like I’m rambling.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to know. Let's talk about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a difficult question. My mother… she had some heart problems later in life, I believe. And my father… he had diabetes, I think. It was many years ago, and I wasn’t very involved in their medical care. They lived in Ethiopia, and I… I haven’t seen them in a long time. It's difficult to recall the specifics. I apologize again for being so vague. It feels like my memory is… fragmented.
DOCTOR: Okay. And do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, I do not. I've never smoked, and I rarely drink alcohol. Perhaps a glass of wine on special occasions, but that's it. And no, I do not use any recreational drugs. My husband… he didn’t approve, and I’ve always followed his example. I apologize. I feel like I’m just stating the obvious. I wish I could provide more helpful information.
DOCTOR: Okay. And finally, do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, I don't believe so. I've never had any allergic reactions to medications or food. I can eat pretty much anything, and I've never had a rash or difficulty breathing after taking a pill. My husband always double-checked the ingredients before I took anything, just to be safe. I apologize again for being so vague. I feel like I’m just repeating myself, and I’m not providing any useful information. I wish I could be more helpful.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lilyanna, thank you for answering my questions. I know it’s difficult, and I appreciate your patience. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam to get a better understanding of what’s going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that would be fine. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me, Doctor. I’m ready whenever you are. I… I just hope you can find something. It’s unsettling to feel so… off balance, and I worry about falling.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s start with your blood pressure and pulse. Then I'll listen to your heart and lungs, and check your ears and eyes. I’ll also do some basic neurological tests to assess your balance and coordination. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, but not significantly. Your pulse is good. Your heart and lungs sound good. Your ears look clear. I’m looking at the back of your eyes now... there’s a slight amount of drusen, which is common for your age, but nothing concerning at this time. Now, I'm going to check your balance. Can you stand up for me and close your eyes?
PATIENT: Yes, I can. Oh… whoa. It’s… it’s difficult to balance. I feel a little dizzy now. I apologize. I knew I shouldn’t have skipped breakfast.
DOCTOR: That's alright, Lilyanna. No need to apologize. It’s good we're seeing this now. Just stay right there. Okay. And can you walk a few steps for me, heel-to-toe?
PATIENT: Oh… this is… difficult. I feel like I’m going to fall. I apologize. It’s… it’s harder than it looks. I need to hold onto something.
DOCTOR: Okay. Just stay close to me. It’s alright. We’re just gathering information. Now, can you stand with your feet together and close your eyes again?
PATIENT: Oh… whoa. I… I can’t do it. I’m going to fall.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lilyanna, that’s enough for now. You did a good job. It’s important that we identified this instability. Based on what you’ve told me and the physical exam, it seems like you’re experiencing some balance issues. The dizziness, unsteadiness, and difficulty with coordination are concerning. The fact that you feel unsteady even with your eyes open is significant. Given your history of loss, and the new onset of these symptoms, we need to rule out a few things. I'm concerned about potential inner ear problems, neurological issues, and, though less likely, problems with your blood pressure regulation. I'd also like to assess for any vitamin deficiencies that might be contributing. I’m going to order some blood tests – a complete blood count, a vitamin D level, and a B12 level. I also want you to get an MRI of your brain to rule out any structural problems. And I’m going to refer you to an audiologist for a hearing test and balance assessment. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… thorough. And it sounds good. I appreciate you taking me seriously, Doctor. I’m glad you’re investigating this. An MRI… that sounds a little scary, but if it’s necessary, then yes, I’ll do it. And the audiologist… yes, that’s fine. I just want to know what’s going on, and hopefully, find a way to feel stable again. I apologize for being so… anxious. I just want to get back to my life.
DOCTOR: You're not being anxious at all, Lilyanna. It's perfectly reasonable to be concerned. We're going to get to the bottom of this together. I'm going to give you a prescription for meclizine, which is an over-the-counter medication that can help with dizziness and nausea. It may help alleviate some of your symptoms while we're waiting for the test results. Take one tablet every 8 hours as needed. I'll also give you instructions for how to schedule the MRI and the audiologist appointment. The MRI will be at the hospital downtown, and the audiologist is located in the medical park across town. I want to see you back here in two weeks to discuss the test results. If your symptoms worsen significantly before then, or if you experience any new symptoms, like a headache, fever, or difficulty speaking, please call the office immediately, or go to the nearest emergency room. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. You've explained everything very clearly. Meclizine… I'll make sure to pick that up. And I'll schedule the appointments as soon as possible. Thank you, Doctor Alzoubi. I truly appreciate your help. I feel… a little better, just knowing that we’re doing something about this. I apologize for rambling again.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Lilyanna. Don't apologize for anything. And please, don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns at all. Take care, and I'll see you in two weeks.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. Goodbye.
