DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Haggar. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Rakosky. It’s nice to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, it’s a bit strange, to be honest. I’ve been feeling really tired lately, and I’m kind of…yellow. My skin and the whites of my eyes, you know? It started a few days ago, and I think it might be connected to some fava beans I ate.
DOCTOR: I see. Tiredness and yellowing of the skin and eyes… that is certainly something we need to investigate. The fava beans are a potentially important detail. Just to clarify, Ms. Haggar, when you say “a few days ago,” can you be more specific about when you first noticed these symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think… It was probably last Friday, the 26th of July. I had a big plate of them with my dinner, and I started feeling a little off that evening. But I didn’t really think much of it at first, just a bit sluggish. Then yesterday, my daughter pointed out that I looked… unwell. That’s when I really started to worry.
DOCTOR: Okay, Friday the 26th. And your daughter noticed the yellowing yesterday. Thank you for that detail. Have you experienced any other symptoms alongside the tiredness and yellowing?
PATIENT: Let me see… Well, my pee has been…darker than usual, almost like tea. And I’ve been a bit nauseous, not throwing up, just feeling queasy. Oh, and a little bit of stomach pain, kind of a dull ache. It's not terrible, but it's there.
DOCTOR: Dark urine, nausea, and abdominal pain… alright. Now, Ms. Haggar, I'm going to ask a few more general questions about your health history. Have you had any significant medical problems in the past?
PATIENT: Not really, no. I had my appendix out when I was a teenager, and I’ve had the usual colds and flu, but nothing major. I’ve always been pretty healthy, to be honest. I don't take any regular medication, either. Just over-the-counter pain relievers when I need them.
DOCTOR: Okay, appendectomy as a teenager, otherwise generally healthy, and no regular medications. Good to know. Do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else, Ms. Haggar?
PATIENT: No, not that I’m aware of. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything. I can eat all sorts of foods, and I haven’t had any issues with pollen or anything like that. I’m pretty lucky, I think.
DOCTOR: That’s good. No known allergies. Now, I’m going to ask about your family history. Do you know if anyone in your family has had any problems with their liver, gallbladder, or blood disorders?
PATIENT: Hmm, that’s a good question. My mother had some… problems with her stomach, but I don’t know exactly what. She didn’t really talk much about her health. And my father, he was always very healthy too. I don’t think anyone in the family had anything to do with the liver, or the blood, specifically. I’m really not sure, to be honest. It’s not something we ever really discussed. Would it help if I asked my daughter? She's pretty good at remembering things like that.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Haggar. It's not always easy to recall family medical history. If you’d like to ask your daughter, that could be helpful. For now, let’s move on. Could you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Sure. I work as a receptionist at a doctor's office, funny enough. It’s mostly sitting at a desk, answering phones, and scheduling appointments. Not very active, I suppose. I don't smoke, and I hardly ever drink alcohol – maybe a glass of wine once or twice a year. I try to eat a healthy diet, lots of vegetables and fruits, but I do enjoy a good pastry now and then. I live alone, and I don’t have any pets. It's a pretty quiet life.
DOCTOR: Okay, receptionist, sedentary lifestyle, no smoking, minimal alcohol consumption, and a generally healthy diet. That's helpful to know. Now, Ms. Haggar, with your permission, I’d like to perform a brief physical examination. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your abdomen, and look at your skin more closely. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, that’s fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgment. I just want to figure out what’s going on, you know? It’s a little scary feeling so unwell.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Ms. Haggar. We'll do our best to get to the bottom of this. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going to gently palpate your abdomen. Please let me know if you feel any pain or discomfort. Any pain here?
PATIENT: No, not really. A little tender, maybe, but nothing sharp. It’s just… uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Okay. And here?
PATIENT: A little bit more tender on the right side, lower down. It's not awful, but I can definitely feel something there. It's like a dull ache. Not a stabbing pain, just… there.
DOCTOR: Alright. And finally, let's take a look at your skin. As I suspected, there is indeed some jaundice present, both in your skin and the whites of your eyes. It’s relatively mild at the moment, but noticeable. Based on what you've told me, and what I’ve observed during the examination, the fava beans, the fatigue, the dark urine, and the jaundice… it raises suspicion for a condition called G6PD deficiency, which can cause hemolytic anemia when exposed to certain substances, such as fava beans. However, we need to run some tests to confirm this. I would like to order a complete blood count, a liver function panel, and a G6PD enzyme assay. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: That sounds… complicated. But yes, of course. Whatever tests you think are necessary, Doctor. I just want to know what’s going on and how to fix it. Is G6PD deficiency…serious? And what does it mean about the fava beans? I eat them sometimes, with my dinner…
DOCTOR: It is good you’re asking questions, Ms. Haggar. G6PD deficiency is a genetic condition. It means your body doesn't produce enough of an enzyme called G6PD, which protects your red blood cells from damage. Certain things – like fava beans, some medications, and even infections – can trigger the red blood cells to break down prematurely, leading to anemia, fatigue, and jaundice, like you’re experiencing. It’s often manageable, and most people with G6PD deficiency live normal lives. The key is to avoid triggers, like fava beans in your case. The tests will confirm the diagnosis, and we can then discuss a plan to avoid triggers, monitor your condition, and address any symptoms you may experience. We’ll get this figured out. I'll order the tests right away. The lab technician will draw some blood. Once we have the results – usually within a day or two – we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and create a treatment plan. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds…much better, actually. Knowing what it might be, and that it’s manageable…that’s a relief. A day or two… okay. And I’ll definitely stay away from the fava beans! So, the blood test… where do I go? And do I need to do anything special beforehand? Like, should I fast? Or…?
DOCTOR: You'll go to the lab just down the hall, room 203. No, you don’t need to fast. You can eat and drink normally before the test. Just try to drink plenty of water. Here’s the requisition form. The lab technician will need this. They’re expecting you. They will take a small sample of your blood, and it will be sent to the lab for analysis. Do you have any questions about getting to the lab, or what to expect during the blood draw?
PATIENT: No, I think I’m okay. Room 203, no fasting… got it. It’s just… a little scary, I guess. But knowing we're getting closer to figuring it out helps. Thank you, Doctor. You've been very helpful, and very patient with all my questions. I really appreciate it. I guess I’ll go to the lab now.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Haggar. It's my job. Don’t hesitate to ask if anything comes up. And please, don't worry too much. We’re taking the right steps. Room 203 is just down the hall on your left. Once you've had the blood drawn, you’re free to go. We’ll be in touch as soon as the results are available. Take care, Ms. Haggar. And please, avoid the fava beans!
PATIENT: Okay, I will! Thank you again, Doctor Rakosky. Bye!
