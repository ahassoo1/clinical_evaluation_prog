DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Cantoran. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Kalinski. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Ugh, morning. Look, I don’t have all day, okay? It’s this tiredness. It’s just…getting worse. And…and I’ve been eating dirt. Not like, on purpose, but I just…feel like I need it. Don't look at me like that. It’s embarrassing, I know.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Cantoran. Thank you for sharing that with me; it takes courage to discuss things that feel sensitive. It's not my place to judge, and I assure you, I’ve encountered a variety of concerns during my years of practice. Let’s focus on getting to the bottom of this tiredness and also understanding this…urge to consume dirt. Could you tell me a little more about the tiredness?
PATIENT: Honestly? It's just…always. Doesn’t matter if I sleep, doesn't matter if I don't. Just…heavy. Like I’m dragging weights around all the time. It’s been going on for…a while now. Months, I guess? Longer? Hard to say, really. Everything kinda blends together these days.
DOCTOR: I see. “Always,” regardless of sleep, and for months now. That certainly sounds debilitating. And you mentioned everything “blends together.” Are you experiencing any difficulties with your memory or concentration, Ms. Cantoran?
PATIENT: Ugh, don't even get me started. Memory? What memory? I forget things constantly. Where I put my keys, what I had for breakfast…sometimes even who people are, if I haven’t seen them in a bit. It’s…frustrating, to say the least. And concentrating? Forget about it. My mind just wanders.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Cantoran. The fatigue and the cognitive difficulties – the memory problems and trouble concentrating – are certainly concerning. And we need to address the urge to eat dirt as well. Before we move forward, could you tell me a little more about when this urge started, and if anything specific triggers it?
PATIENT: Triggers? I don't know...it just happens. I think it started around…maybe spring? Or was it summer? Honestly, the seasons all run together too. It's when I'm…stressed, I guess? Or bored? I don't know. It’s not like I go out of my way to find it, it’s just…if I’m outside, I see it, and I just…feel like I need a little. It sounds crazy, I know.
DOCTOR: It doesn’t sound crazy, Ms. Cantoran. It sounds like something we need to investigate. This behavior, along with your fatigue and memory issues, is unusual, and we need to rule out any underlying medical causes. Now, let’s talk a bit about your overall health. Do you have any other symptoms you’ve been experiencing?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Let me think…my stomach's been…off. Not always, but sometimes. And I get headaches. Not terrible ones, just…dull aches. And…oh! My skin has been really dry lately. Like, peeling dry. That’s about it, I think. I just feel…old, okay? I feel old and tired and…fuzzy.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Cantoran. Stomach upset, headaches, and dry, peeling skin, in addition to the fatigue, memory issues, and the…urge to consume dirt. These symptoms taken together are prompting me to consider a few possibilities, and we’ll need to run some tests to get a clearer picture. Before we proceed with testing, could you tell me a little bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: Medical history? Ugh. Honestly, it’s all a blur. I haven’t been to a doctor in…years. My husband, God rest his soul, he took care of all that. I remember…he had heart trouble. That's about it. I don't really have any…problems, I guess? Besides what I’ve already told you. I mean, I'm old. People get tired when they're old.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's not uncommon for details to become less clear over time, and I appreciate you sharing what you remember about your husband's health. The fact that you haven’t been to a doctor in years is also helpful information. Now, Ms. Cantoran, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Surgeries…let me think… No, not really. Maybe when I was a kid? Tonsils, maybe? I honestly don’t remember. And no hospital stays, not that I recall. Nothing major, anyway. I’m pretty tough. Always have been.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Cantoran. Now, I'm going to ask about your family. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family… hmm. My mother, she had…diabetes, I think? Or maybe it was high blood pressure. They all get something, eventually. And my grandmother…she was always just…sickly. Weak. That's about all I remember. Honestly, we weren't a very close family.
DOCTOR: I see. Diabetes or high blood pressure in your mother, and a generally unwell grandmother. Thank you for sharing that. Now, Ms. Cantoran, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle? What do you mean? I mostly stay home. Watch TV. Cook. I used to garden, but honestly, I don’t have the energy for that anymore. I live alone, you see. It’s…quiet. That’s about it.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Cantoran. And do you currently take any medications, or have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Medications? No. Never really been one for pills. Allergies… hmm. Not that I know of. Maybe a little itchy sometimes when I eat shrimp, but that’s about it. Look, can we hurry this up? I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Cantoran. I apologize if the questions seem lengthy; I simply want to gather as much information as possible to ensure I understand your situation fully. Alright, given your symptoms – the persistent fatigue, memory difficulties, the unusual urge to eat dirt, stomach issues, dry skin, and the lack of recent medical care – I'd like to order some blood tests. We'll check your complete blood count, electrolytes, kidney and liver function, thyroid levels, vitamin levels – particularly vitamin D and B12 – and iron studies. We'll also want to check for any signs of inflammation. I’d also like to do a brief physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Ugh, fine. Whatever. Just get it over with. Blood tests, exam…whatever you need to do. Just tell me when it’s done. I have a TV show I want to watch.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Cantoran. Let's proceed with the exam first, then we'll get the blood work ordered. Your heart sounds regular, but a little bit faint. Your lungs are clear. Your abdomen is soft, but I do notice some mild tenderness in your lower quadrants. Your skin is quite dry and flaky, as you mentioned. Your reflexes are a bit diminished, and I'm noticing some slight difficulty with coordination. I'm going to have the nurse draw a few vials of blood now. Then, we'll discuss the next steps.
PATIENT: Just get it over with. Honestly, this is a waste of my time.
DOCTOR: The nurse will be with you in just a moment to draw your blood, Ms. Cantoran. Once the lab results are back, we'll have a clearer understanding of what might be causing your symptoms. In the meantime, I want to assure you that we are taking this seriously and will work towards finding a solution. Do you have any questions for me before we proceed with the blood draw?
PATIENT: No. Just…when will I get the results? I don't want to be waiting around for weeks.
DOCTOR: The lab typically takes 2-3 business days to return results. The nurse will let you know how to access them online through our patient portal once they are available. We can also schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them in detail as soon as they are back. Would that be agreeable to you?
PATIENT: Fine. Just…call me. Don’t make me figure out some website. And please, no more questions, okay? I’m tired. Really tired.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Cantoran. We will contact you directly by phone as soon as the results are available. No further questions, I assure you. Thank you for your patience. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood. In the meantime, please relax. If you experience any sudden or worsening symptoms, please don't hesitate to contact the clinic immediately. Is there anything else I can assist you with before the nurse arrives?
PATIENT: No. Just…get it over with.
DOCTOR: Very well. Thank you, Ms. Cantoran. .
