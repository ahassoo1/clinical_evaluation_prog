DOCTOR: Good morning, Dawnetta. It’s lovely to meet you. I’m Dr. Finco. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning. Don’t bother with the “lovely” part, we’ll get this over with. It’s my stool. It’s… dark. Black, like. I take pills, you see. For my arthritis. Been taking ‘em for years. It’s probably that, isn’t it? I don’t have time for a lot of fuss.
DOCTOR: Okay, dark stool… and you suspect it might be related to your arthritis medication?
PATIENT: Suspect? Well, what else would it be? I haven’t been eating anything odd. And it’s not like I’m dropping dead or anything. Just… different. And honestly, I haven’t got the energy to go listing every single thing I’ve eaten for the past month. It’s these pills, I tell you. They always warn you about everything but the color of your… waste.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Dawnetta. It’s good you’re aware of potential side effects. And you're right to bring it up. While it could be related to your arthritis medication, dark stool can have a few different causes, and it’s best to rule things out. To be thorough, could you tell me a little more about the stool itself?
PATIENT: Oh, for heaven's sake. “Rule things out”? Look, I’m 73 years old. I’ve lived a long life. I don’t need a full investigation over a bit of… discoloration. But fine. It’s… tarry. That’s the word, isn’t it? Sticky. And it smells… well, it smells like stool. What do you want me to say?
DOCTOR: Tarry, sticky… yes, that’s helpful. And you haven’t noticed any blood in it, or any change in your bowel habits besides the color?
PATIENT: Blood? No! Definitely no blood. And my… habits are regular enough. I go when I need to go. Don’t need to be asking me about that. Honestly, it's just… concerning. I read things on the internet, you know? And it’s always the worst things. I don't want to end up with… well, never mind. It’s probably nothing.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, and it’s good you’re paying attention to changes. The internet can certainly be alarming. To get a clearer picture, could you tell me the name of the arthritis medication you're taking?
PATIENT: It’s… Naproxen. That’s the name. 500 milligrams, twice a day. Been on it for… oh, goodness, I don’t know. Years. Maybe ten? More? They keep changing the doctors, you see, so I forget who told me what when. It helps the pain, mostly.
DOCTOR: Okay, Naproxen 500mg twice a day. And you haven't had any stomach pain, nausea, or vomiting along with this change in stool color?
PATIENT: Stomach pain? Sometimes. A bit of indigestion, mostly. Happens with the pills, I expect. And no, no vomiting. I’m not a delicate flower, you know. Just a bit… uncomfortable. Honestly, I just want to know if I need to worry or not. Is it serious?
DOCTOR: Okay. Dark, tarry stools can sometimes indicate bleeding in the upper digestive tract. Naproxen, like other NSAIDs, can sometimes cause stomach irritation and bleeding. However, it can also be caused by other things, and it's not always serious. To be safe, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, and I'm going to order a stool test to check for blood. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: A test? Oh, honestly. Fine. Get it over with. But don't expect me to come back if it's just a waste of time. And don't bother with a lot of explanations. I’m not a doctor. Just… do it.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’ll keep it as quick and straightforward as possible. First, let’s just listen to your abdomen, and then I’ll do a quick palpation. Okay. Your abdomen sounds normal, and it doesn't seem particularly tender to the touch. That's a good sign. Now, I’ll just explain the stool test briefly. It involves collecting a small sample, and the lab will test it for hidden blood. It's a relatively simple procedure. Do you have any questions before we proceed?
PATIENT: Hidden blood? Oh, lovely. More fuss. No, I don’t have any questions. Just tell me where to… collect it. And please, don’t make me come back if it’s nothing. I have better things to do.
DOCTOR: Certainly. The bathroom is right through there. There are instructions and a collection kit on the toilet. Just follow those, and then bring the sample back to the nurse’s station. They’ll take care of sending it to the lab. I’ll let you go ahead and do that. I’ll review the results as soon as they come in, and we can discuss them. It usually takes a couple of days. In the meantime, if you experience any severe abdominal pain, black, tarry stools that persist, or feel weak or dizzy, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Is that clear?
PATIENT: Emergency room? Honestly! Fine. Yes, clear. I'll go do this… ridiculous test. And don’t bother calling me unless it’s important. I’m not spending another afternoon in a doctor’s office over a bit of… color. .
DOCTOR: Alright. Take your time. .
