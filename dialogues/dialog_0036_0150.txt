DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Shteynberg. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Bacy. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Yes, well, good morning to you too, Doctor. Honestly? I don’t have time for this, but my… friend suggested I come. I want to have a baby. A healthy one. And I want to make sure everything is… working properly before I even try. I’m not getting any younger, you know. And I’d rather not waste my time.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Ms. Shteynberg. That’s very responsible of you to want to get things checked out beforehand. It's good you're thinking ahead. We absolutely can do a preconception checkup to assess your overall health and identify any potential issues. To start, can you tell me a little bit about your menstrual cycles?
PATIENT: Oh, cycles. Really? Do I have to? Look, they’ve always been… irregular. Sometimes they’re close together, sometimes they’re… not. It varies. I haven’t really kept track, honestly. I’m a busy woman. Is this necessary? I just want to know if I can have a baby, not give you a history lesson on my… monthly events.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Shteynberg, and I apologize if I’m asking personal questions. It is important information, though, as irregular cycles can sometimes indicate hormonal imbalances or other issues that could affect fertility. Even a rough estimate of how often you typically have periods, and how long they usually last, would be helpful. If tracking them feels like a burden, we can discuss some options for hormonal testing that might give us more information without needing a detailed cycle history. Would that be preferable?
PATIENT: Testing. Yes, testing sounds… efficient. I don’t need to sit around remembering things. Just… test me. Whatever tests will tell you if I’m able to conceive a child. Quickly. And tell me the results. I have things to do, Doctor. A very important bicycle needs repairing, you see.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Shteynberg. We can definitely focus on testing. I'm going to order a comprehensive panel that includes hormone levels, a complete blood count, and a metabolic panel to get a baseline of your overall health. We’ll also want to check your thyroid function. I'll also order a urine test to rule out any infection. Before we proceed, do you have any allergies to medications or latex?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. Absolutely not. I am a very healthy woman. I eat well – mostly – and I’m very active. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. Though… I think I once had a slight rash after using a particularly cheap bicycle tire sealant. But that was years ago. Don’t worry about that. Just… get on with the tests. And can you tell me how long these will take? I really can’t be here all day.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. We'll disregard the bicycle sealant reaction. The blood work will take a few minutes to draw, and then the lab typically takes 2-3 business days to get the results back to us. The urine test can be done right here in the office and we'll have those results almost immediately. I'd also like to ask a few questions about your medical history while we're waiting for the lab results, if you don’t mind. Have you ever been diagnosed with any chronic medical conditions, like diabetes, high blood pressure, or thyroid problems?
PATIENT: Oh, history. Wonderful. No. Nothing chronic. I had the flu once, badly, about twenty years ago. And I broke my wrist falling off a bicycle – ironic, I know – but it healed perfectly. My mother had… something with her stomach, I think. Ulcers, maybe? But I don’t have that. I’m strong. Very strong. And I take care of myself. Frankly, Doctor, I find these questions… tedious. Are you sure you need all this information? It feels like a waste of time.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Shteynberg. I apologize if the questions feel tedious. I’m asking these questions not to waste your time, but to get a complete picture of your health and identify any potential risk factors that could affect your ability to conceive or carry a healthy pregnancy. Even seemingly minor details can be important. Just to clarify, when you say your mother had “something with her stomach,” do you know if she was ever diagnosed with any specific conditions, like gastritis, GERD, or any type of cancer?
PATIENT: Ugh. Cancer. Yes, that sounds right. Stomach cancer, I believe. She… didn’t live very long. It was… unpleasant. And honestly, I don’t want to dwell on it. It was a very long time ago. Look, is this relevant to me? I’m perfectly healthy. I eat a balanced diet - when I have time - and I exercise regularly. I simply want to know if I can have a baby, not rehash my family’s medical history. Can we just skip this part? I have a very demanding schedule, you see. And a bicycle that is waiting.
DOCTOR: I understand your desire to move quickly, Ms. Shteynberg, and I respect that. However, a family history of stomach cancer can sometimes indicate a slightly increased risk of certain genetic predispositions, and it’s important for me to be aware of that. It doesn't necessarily mean you're at risk, but it might warrant further investigation if the initial tests show any concerning results. To proceed, let’s briefly discuss your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Lifestyle? Really? Now you’re judging me, aren’t you? No. Absolutely not. I do not smoke. I might have a small glass of wine with dinner occasionally – a very small glass – but that’s it. And recreational drugs? Heavens, no. I am a respectable woman. I have no time for… frivolities. I need to get back to my work, Doctor. I have a business to run. And a bicycle. A very important bicycle. Are we almost finished here?
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Shteynberg. Thank you for the information. Just a few more quick questions, then we can move on to the physical exam and order the tests. Have you ever been pregnant before?
PATIENT: No. Never. And frankly, I'm getting rather tired of these questions. It feels like an interrogation. Look, I came here to find out if I can have a baby, not relive my entire life story. I thought doctors were supposed to help people, not pry into their personal affairs. Are we done yet? I really need to get back to work. The bicycle is waiting. And honestly, it's starting to look rather… neglected.
DOCTOR: Ms. Shteynberg, I understand your frustration, and I apologize if my questions have felt intrusive. I assure you, I am only asking these questions to provide you with the best possible care and to ensure a safe and healthy pregnancy, should you choose to conceive. I also want to assure you that all your medical information is confidential and protected. With that said, let's move on to a brief physical exam. I'd like to check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and perform a pelvic exam. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: A pelvic exam? Now you’re just being… No. Absolutely not. I am not comfortable with that. Not at all. I came here for tests, Doctor, not a… invasive examination. I’m a busy woman. I don’t have time for this. And frankly, I find your line of questioning rather… inappropriate. Just order the tests. That’s all I want. No examination. No further questions. Just… the tests. And then I’d like to leave. Immediately.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Shteynberg. I respect your decision. We will proceed with ordering the blood work and urine tests as requested. However, I must inform you that a physical exam, including a pelvic exam, is a standard part of preconception counseling and can help identify potential issues that may not be apparent through testing alone. I strongly recommend considering a full exam with a specialist, but I will honor your wishes at this time. I will write the orders for the lab tests now. They will need a blood sample and a urine sample. Do you know where the nearest lab is to your home or work?
PATIENT: A lab. Fine. Yes, I know the lab on Elm Street. It’s… acceptable. Just give me the orders. And then I’m leaving. I have a bicycle that is desperately in need of my attention. Frankly, I’m starting to regret coming here. It’s been a complete waste of my time. Just… the orders. Please. And then I’m going. Immediately. Is that clear?
DOCTOR: Here are the orders for the blood work and urine tests. The lab on Elm Street should be able to accommodate you. The results will be sent to me within 2-3 business days. Once I have the results, I will contact you to discuss them and answer any questions you may have. I still strongly recommend considering a complete physical exam with a specialist, but I understand your reluctance. Do you have any questions for me before you leave?
PATIENT: No. Absolutely not. No questions. I’m done here. Thank you for… nothing. I’m leaving now. And I sincerely hope I don’t have to come back. Goodbye.
