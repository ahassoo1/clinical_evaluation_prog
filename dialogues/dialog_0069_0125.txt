DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Belan. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Andraca. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Yeah, good to meet you too. Look, I just… I wanted to get tested for, you know, the thing. HIV. I just figured it’s better to be safe than sorry, really. My wife and I… well, we’re both pretty careful, but you hear stories, don’t you? It’s just… peace of mind, that’s all.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It's very responsible of you to think about getting tested, even with taking precautions. Peace of mind is a perfectly valid reason. Before we proceed with the testing, could you tell me a little more about your and your wife’s level of risk?
PATIENT: Risk? What kind of risk? We… we use protection. Always. Honestly, I don’t even know what you mean by “level of risk”. It's not like we're just… being reckless. I mean, we’ve been together for ten years, married for seven. It's not like I’m going around… with other people. What sort of questions are you trying to get at here?
DOCTOR: I apologize if my question was unclear or came across as accusatory. That wasn’t my intention at all. I simply meant to gather some information that helps us understand the best approach to testing. Sometimes, even with consistent protection, there can be factors that increase risk – like, if the protection isn’t used perfectly every time, or if either of you has had any medical procedures where there might be a very small chance of exposure. It’s routine information, and helps ensure accurate interpretation of results. Perhaps I can rephrase. Have either you or your wife ever had a sexually transmitted infection before?
PATIENT: Look, I don’t appreciate the implication here. You’re making it sound like you don't believe us. We’re responsible adults. No, neither of us has ever had anything like that. And frankly, I find this line of questioning quite insulting. I came here for a simple test, not an interrogation about my personal life. Are we going to do the test or are you just going to keep asking me these… these ridiculous questions?
DOCTOR: I sincerely apologize, Mr. Belan. You are absolutely right to be upset, and I am truly sorry if my questions came across as accusatory or insulting. That was not my intention in the slightest. I am still relatively new to practicing internal medicine and am learning the best way to approach sensitive topics with patients. I am asking these questions as part of a standard risk assessment to ensure the most accurate testing and provide the best care, but I clearly haven’t communicated that effectively. Let’s put that aside. We can absolutely proceed with the testing. Are you aware of the different types of HIV tests available, and would you like me to explain the options to you?
PATIENT: Fine. Look, I just want it over with. Explain the tests. Quickly. I have things to do, you know. I didn't spend all day just to be quizzed on… on everything. Just tell me what’s involved, which one’s fastest, and let’s get it done. I’d rather have a blood test, if that’s an option. I don't like things… poking around.
DOCTOR: Certainly. There are a few options. The most common is a blood test, which we can definitely do. It looks for antibodies to HIV – your body's response to the virus. It typically takes about a week or two to get the results back from the lab. There’s also a rapid antibody test that can be done with a finger prick, and gives results in about 30 minutes, but it can sometimes be less accurate. Finally, there's a Nucleic Acid Test which detects the actual virus itself, but it’s usually reserved for situations where there’s a very high risk of recent exposure, and it’s more expensive. Given your preference, a standard blood test seems like the best option. It’s very accurate, and we can order it right away. Would that work for you?
PATIENT: Yeah, the blood test is fine. Get it over with. I don’t need a lecture about the different kinds, just… do it. And make sure whoever’s drawing the blood is good at it. I hate needles. Honestly, I'd prefer my wife come with me next time for anything like this. She’s a lot more… patient. And less likely to be treated like I'm some sort of… suspect.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I understand your concerns, and I will personally ensure that a skilled phlebotomist draws your blood. They are very experienced and gentle. I will also make a note in your chart about your preference for your wife to accompany you for future appointments, and we will absolutely accommodate that. We'll need to draw a small amount of blood, about a vial or two. Before we do that, I just need to ask a few quick, routine questions about your medical history – allergies, medications you’re taking, things like that. It's standard procedure. Do you have any known allergies?
PATIENT: No. None. And I don't take any medication. Never have. I eat well, I exercise, I’m perfectly healthy. Honestly, I don't know why I even have to be here. It's just… bureaucracy, isn’t it? My wife insisted, said it was "responsible." I still think it's a waste of time.
DOCTOR: I understand your skepticism, Mr. Belan. While you may feel perfectly healthy, routine testing can sometimes identify things that aren't immediately apparent. It's about being proactive, as your wife mentioned. Okay, no allergies, no medications. Have you ever had any major illnesses or surgeries?
PATIENT: No. Nothing like that. A few colds, maybe, when I was a kid. Broken arm when I was about eight, playing football. But that’s it. Look, is this going to take much longer? I really do have things to do. And the waiting room is… less than pleasant. It smells like disinfectant and sadness, if you know what I mean.
DOCTOR: I completely understand, and I apologize for the wait and the less-than-ideal atmosphere. We’re almost finished with the preliminary questions. Just a few more quick things. Do you have any family history of serious illness – heart disease, cancer, diabetes, things like that?
PATIENT: My mother had… high blood pressure, I think. And my grandfather, on my father’s side, had something with his heart. But that was a long time ago, when they didn’t have proper medicine. My father is perfectly healthy, still working hard every day. Honestly, it’s all very… distant. It’s not like it affects me, is it? I’m a perfectly healthy man.
DOCTOR: Okay. Thank you for that information. Alright, Mr. Belan, I think we have everything we need. We'll draw a small sample of blood now. The phlebotomist will be in shortly. Is there anything you'd like to ask me before we proceed?
PATIENT: No. Just get it over with. And make sure they don’t poke around too much. I really hate needles. Honestly, this whole thing is… ridiculous. But fine. Let's just get it done.
DOCTOR: Okay. I understand. I'll let the phlebotomist know your concerns. "Could we please have a phlebotomist to room three when you have a moment?
PATIENT: .
