DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Firestone, so… what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, it’s my legs. They just… gave out. Not completely, thankfully, but they’re weak. It started a few days ago, right after I got over a really nasty cold. Just felt… wobbly, you know? And it’s both of them, which is what’s worrying me. It’s not like I tripped or anything; they just… stopped working properly.
DOCTOR: Wobbliness… after a cold. Right. Any pain associated with it?
PATIENT: Pain? Not really. It’s not painful, exactly. More… uncomfortable. Like trying to walk through thick mud, if that makes any sense. And it's worse in the mornings, definitely. Getting out of bed is… an effort. Honestly, I’ve never had anything like this before. I usually just power through things. I don't typically complain.
DOCTOR: Mornings, you say. And you’re… active normally?
PATIENT: Active? Yes, very. I'm a tour guide, Doctor. I walk all day. Up hills, cobblestone streets, the whole nine yards. I keep people entertained, you know? It requires a lot of energy. I can’t very well do that if I can barely stand, can I? It’s… frustrating, to say the least. This cold was particularly draining, but I thought I was getting over it. Apparently not.
DOCTOR: Tour guide… so you're on your feet constantly. Any fever with the cold?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. A proper fever. Chills, the whole thing. I had it for maybe three days, took some over-the-counter stuff, and it went away. I didn't bother going to the doctor for the cold, you know? It’s just a cold. Everyone gets colds. But then my legs started doing this. It seemed a little… unusual. I’m not one for fussing, Doctor, but I need to be able to walk.
DOCTOR: Right. So, fever followed by leg weakness. And you say both legs. Any numbness or tingling?
PATIENT: No, no tingling. Not that I've noticed. It's just… heavy. Like someone has weights attached to them. And it's not like they're completely useless, mind you. I can walk, but it’s… slow. And I have to really concentrate on it. It's not natural, you know? I used to just walk. It's quite bothersome, frankly. It's slowing me down, and my clients expect a certain energy level.
DOCTOR: Hmm. And have you noticed any difficulty with… bladder or bowel control?
PATIENT: Excuse me? I mean, of course not! What kind of question is that? No, absolutely not. My legs are weak, Doctor, not… malfunctioning in that way. I find that question rather… impertinent, to be honest. I came in here because I can’t walk properly, not to discuss… personal matters.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. Just ruling things out. Standard procedure. Let’s have you stand up for me, if you would. I want to see what we’re dealing with.
PATIENT: Fine. But be warned, I am not as steady as I usually am. This is rather embarrassing, you know? I’m a professional. I shouldn’t be stumbling around in a doctor’s office. Honestly, I expect this will be a simple fix. Something I picked up, nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Yes, I see. Slightly wide-based gait. Some hesitation on initial steps. Can you walk a few steps forward for me?
PATIENT: There. See? It’s not a graceful recovery. I have to really think about each step, and it’s… exhausting. And it’s definitely worse than it was this morning, if that’s possible. Honestly, I'm starting to worry it is something more serious. Though I still maintain it's probably just a bug I picked up.
DOCTOR: Right. I’ll need to check your reflexes now. Please sit back down. And try to relax.
PATIENT: Relax? Easier said than done, Doctor. I have a tour scheduled for tomorrow. A very important one. People are relying on me. I suppose I can try, but I'm not promising anything. Though, honestly, I suspect this is all rather unnecessary. A good rest and some vitamins… that's usually all I need.
DOCTOR: Okay. Reflexes are… diminished. Not absent, but noticeably reduced. And… any family history of neurological problems?
PATIENT: Neurological problems… Hmm. My grandmother, on my mother's side, she had something… I don’t recall the exact name. Something with… weakness. She ended up in a wheelchair, eventually. But that was years ago, and I wasn’t very close to her. I’m not sure if it was… hereditary or just old age. It wasn’t something we talked about much, to be frank. We preferred to focus on more… cheerful topics.
DOCTOR: Right. Wheelchair… diminished reflexes… We'll need to run some bloodwork, and possibly an MRI. I suspect it could be something called Guillain-Barré syndrome. It's rare, but it fits the presentation. It’s triggered by infections, like a cold. Don't panic, it is treatable. But we need to rule other things out first. I’ll have the nurse draw some blood, and schedule an MRI for you. It’ll take a little time to get the results. .
PATIENT: Guillain-Barré… What is that? Sounds… dreadful. Honestly, Doctor, I was hoping for something simpler. A vitamin deficiency, perhaps? And an MRI? That sounds… inconvenient. I have a schedule, you know. I suppose I have no choice, but I trust you're certain this is necessary? And how long will this… process take? I need to know if I'll be able to work tomorrow. This is very disruptive.
