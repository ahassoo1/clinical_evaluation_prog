DOCTOR: Good morning, Tarin. My name is Dr. Seil. It’s good to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. I’ve been experiencing some numbness in my leg, and I thought it best to have it checked out. It’s…well, it’s been going on for a little while now.
DOCTOR: Okay, numbness in your leg. I understand. And you said it's been going on for a little while – can you tell me more specifically how long?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think precisely. It began approximately three weeks ago, on the 15th of July. It wasn’t constant at first, just occasional tingling, really. But over the past week it’s become more…persistent, I suppose is the right word. It’s not a sharp pain, more of a…deadness, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes sense. “Deadness” is a good way to describe it. And it started on July 15th, and has gradually become more persistent over the last week. Can you tell me where exactly in your leg you're experiencing this numbness?
PATIENT: It’s primarily in my left leg, Doctor. It begins just below my knee, and extends down to my foot. There’s a little bit of it in my calf as well, but the majority is concentrated in my shin and the top of my foot. It doesn’t seem to affect my thigh, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Okay, so primarily in the left leg, starting below the knee, down to the foot – shin and top of the foot being the most affected areas, with some in the calf. And thankfully, not affecting the thigh. Does anything specific seem to trigger the numbness, or make it worse?
PATIENT: That's a good question. Thinking on it… prolonged standing seems to exacerbate it. I work on film sets, as a special effects artist, so I'm often on my feet for extended periods. Also, if I cross my legs for too long, it tends to worsen. I don’t recall any particular injury that might have caused it, and it doesn’t seem to be related to the weather, or anything like that.
DOCTOR: Okay, so prolonged standing at work, and crossing your legs seem to be triggers. No recent injury, and not related to weather. And you mentioned you’re a special effects artist. Does your work involve a lot of repetitive movements, or unusual positions?
PATIENT: Yes, it does, actually. A fair amount of kneeling, crouching, and reaching for equipment. Sometimes I have to hold awkward positions for a little while to get the shot just right. Also, I occasionally work with heavier equipment – not lifting anything excessively heavy, but enough to cause some strain, perhaps. I utilize various tools and props, requiring precise hand and arm movements. It's not always physically strenuous, but it’s definitely not a sedentary job.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, a physically demanding job, with kneeling, crouching, reaching, and some strain from equipment. That’s helpful information. Now, outside of the numbness, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Let me see… No pain, as I mentioned. No weakness in my leg or foot, I don’t think. My balance seems fine, and I haven’t noticed any difficulty walking. I suppose I have noticed my left foot feels a little colder than my right one, but that could just be my imagination. No tingling in any other part of my body, and no changes in skin color, as far as I can tell. I have not experienced any bowel or bladder issues, if that is relevant.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s all relevant information, thank you. No pain, no weakness, balance is fine, slightly colder foot on the left, and no changes in bowel/bladder function. To get a better picture, I’d like to do a brief physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. That sounds perfectly reasonable. Please proceed at your convenience. I trust your judgment.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you don’t mind, could you please sit up on the examination table?
PATIENT: Certainly. I’m ready when you are, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Okay, Tarin. I’m going to start by checking your reflexes. Could you relax your legs for me?
PATIENT: Yes, absolutely. I’m relaxed. Go ahead, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Alright. Good reflex on the right side. Now, the left… Hmm. A slightly diminished response on the left. Now I’m going to check your foot strength. Can you point your toes up towards the ceiling?
PATIENT: Yes, I can. Is that sufficient? I can hold it for as long as you need me to. I’m trying to be precise.
DOCTOR: Good. That looks good. Now, can you point your toes downwards, like you're pressing on a gas pedal?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Like this? I am applying firm pressure.
DOCTOR: Good. Now, can you resist me as I try to push your foot up?
PATIENT: Yes, I can. Please proceed, Doctor. I will do my best to hold firm.
DOCTOR: Okay. A little weaker resistance on the left side compared to the right. Now, let’s check sensation. I’m going to lightly touch different areas of your feet and legs with this cotton swab. Tell me when you feel it. Close your eyes for me, please. <stage>I gently touch various points on your legs and feet with the cotton swab, starting with the top of both feet, then the sides, then the soles, asking “Can you feel that?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I am ready. … Yes, I feel that. … Yes, I feel that as well. … Yes, that one too. … Hmm. That one is…slightly diminished. It’s still there, but it feels…less sharp, if that makes sense. It's on the outer side of my left foot, near the little toe. … Yes, I feel that one clearly. … And that one.
DOCTOR: Okay. Diminished sensation on the outer side of your left foot. Thank you. One last thing. I’m going to palpate along your spine and legs, just to check for any tenderness or abnormalities. Does anything feel particularly tender or painful when I press here?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. That feels normal. … No, not there either. … Hmm. Just a slight discomfort… right here. It’s not sharp pain, just… a little sensitive to the touch.
DOCTOR: Okay. Tenderness on the outer side of your lower leg. Alright. That completes the physical exam. Based on what you’ve told me and the exam findings—the diminished reflex, slightly weaker foot strength, diminished sensation, and tenderness—it sounds like you may have some compression or irritation of the peroneal nerve. This nerve runs along the outer side of your leg and provides sensation and control to the foot and ankle. The tenderness on palpation supports this. It's often caused by compression of the nerve as it passes around the fibula—the smaller bone in your lower leg—which can happen from prolonged pressure or repetitive movements.
PATIENT: That's… understandable, given my work. So, the numbness is likely connected to how I'm using my legs on set? What does this mean for treatment, Doctor? Is this something that will require further investigation, like an X-ray or… something more involved?
DOCTOR: Yes, it’s very plausible given your occupation. Prolonged standing and repetitive movements can definitely contribute to peroneal nerve compression. As for treatment, we usually start conservatively. An X-ray isn’t typically needed unless we suspect a fracture or other bony abnormality, which isn’t apparent from your history and exam. More involved tests like an MRI or nerve conduction study could be considered if your symptoms don’t improve with conservative measures, or if they worsen. However, let’s hold off on those for now. Initially, I recommend the following: 1. Rest: Try to minimize prolonged standing and repetitive movements as much as possible. I know that’s challenging with your job, but even small breaks can make a difference. 2. Ice: Apply ice packs to the outer side of your leg for 15-20 minutes at a time, several times a day. 3. Compression: Consider wearing a compression bandage or sleeve to help reduce swelling. 4. Stretching: Gentle stretches of your ankle and foot can help relieve pressure on the nerve. I can demonstrate some simple stretches for you. 5. Proper footwear: Ensure your shoes provide adequate support and cushioning. We can reassess in two weeks to see how you’re progressing. If your symptoms haven’t improved, or if they worsen, we can discuss further investigation options, potentially including a referral to a neurologist or physical therapist. Does that sound reasonable to you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds very reasonable. I appreciate the thorough explanation. I'm certainly willing to try those measures first. The stretches would be particularly helpful, if you wouldn't mind demonstrating them for me. And thank you for considering the possibility of a referral if things don't improve. I'd prefer to avoid more invasive tests if possible, so starting conservatively makes a lot of sense. I will make a note of my follow-up appointment for two weeks from today.
DOCTOR: Excellent. “These stretches should help improve your flexibility and reduce pressure on the nerve. Remember to do them gently, and stop if you feel any pain. Don't push yourself too hard. We also want to ensure you understand the importance of taking breaks at work. Small adjustments can make a big difference.” “Do you have any questions about the stretches, or any other aspect of the treatment plan?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, the stretches are quite clear. I think I can manage those without difficulty. You've explained everything very thoroughly, and I appreciate you taking the time to demonstrate them. I understand the importance of pacing myself and taking breaks as well. I believe I have all the information I need for now. Thank you again for your time and expertise. I'll be sure to follow your recommendations and schedule a follow-up appointment in two weeks.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Tarin. I’m glad I could help. Remember, if your symptoms worsen at any point before your follow-up appointment, don’t hesitate to contact the clinic. Take care, and I hope you experience some improvement soon. .
