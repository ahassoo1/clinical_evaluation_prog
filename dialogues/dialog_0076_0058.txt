DOCTOR: Right, yes. Mr. Osumi, isn't it?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s correct. Vicent Osumi. I appreciate you seeing me, Doctor Ruocco. I’m hoping we can get right to it, if you don't mind. I’m not a fan of long waits, you understand.
DOCTOR: Yes, yes, efficiency is key. Look, I’ve got a busy schedule, so let’s not waste time. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, to be frank, Doctor, it's my weight. It's been… creeping up. I'd like to talk about maybe some medicine to help with it. My wife… she passed last year, and things haven’t been quite the same since. I haven't been looking after myself as well as I should. I’m hoping there’s something that can give me a little boost.
DOCTOR: Right. Weight gain. It's...common, after a loss. Emotional eating, probably. Look, I’m not a therapist, alright?
PATIENT: Oh, no, Doctor, I wasn't expecting you to be a therapist. I just… wanted to explain why it’s happening. And you’re right, it’s probably that. But regardless of the cause, it's bothering me, and I was hoping you could suggest something – medication, perhaps? I'm willing to try almost anything at this point, as long as it's safe, of course.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Let's see... Medicare, alright. And 80 kilograms, 170 centimeters... that puts you at a BMI of... well, never mind the specifics. Look, before we go throwing pills at the problem, I need to ask a few questions. Have you tried anything on your own?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I've been… trying to walk more. I used to enjoy it, with my wife. But it’s hard to get motivated now. I’ve also tried… cutting back on sweets. My wife used to bake, wonderful things, and I… well, I still miss having them around. But honestly, it hasn’t been very effective. It’s just… difficult.
DOCTOR: Right, “tried.” That’s what everyone says. Alright. Any other medical conditions?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not really. I had high blood pressure a few years back, but the doctor – a different one, of course – put me on something for it. I take it regularly, and it seems to be under control. Otherwise, I'm generally healthy, for my age. I try to stay active when I can, despite everything.
DOCTOR: “Despite everything.” Right. Medication for the blood pressure... let me see... ah, here. Lisinopril, 20 milligrams daily. Good. Any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, none that I know of. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything before. My wife always said I was a sturdy Chamorro man, good constitution. Though, she’s not here to confirm it now, is she?
DOCTOR: Alright. No allergies. Good. Let's just do a quick exam, alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds… sensible. Whatever you think is best. I’m happy to cooperate. Just… let’s try to be quick, if possible. I have a few things I need to take care of later.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. Lie down there. Blood pressure first. 140 over 85. Not terrible, but could be better. Now, let me listen to your heart and lungs. Breathe deeply. Lungs are clear. Heart sounds… regular, but a little fast. I'm not detecting any murmurs or abnormalities. Abdomen is soft, non-tender. Nothing obvious here. Alright. You’re… relatively normal. Frankly, it sounds like you just need to exercise more and eat less. But you want a pill, don't you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I understand it sounds… simple. But it is difficult. I know I should be doing more, but… it’s hard to find the motivation, and frankly, I’m a little tired. A little help, a little boost, would be greatly appreciated. I’m not asking for a miracle, just something to make it a little easier. Is there anything… anything at all… you'd recommend?
DOCTOR: Look, there are options. We can try Metformin, often used for diabetes, but it can also help with weight loss in some patients. It has some… gastrointestinal side effects, bloating, nausea, diarrhea. Not fun, but manageable for some. Orlistat. Blocks fat absorption. Messes with your digestion even more. Frequent, oily stools. Honestly, both are a bit unpleasant. I’m not thrilled about either, frankly. But if you insist…
PATIENT: Messes with digestion… well, nothing good comes easy, I suppose. I think… I think I’d rather try the Metformin, if you think it's the lesser of two evils. If the side effects are too much, we can always stop, right? I’m not looking to make things worse, just… a little better.
DOCTOR: Alright. Metformin it is. 500 milligrams twice a day with meals. Start slowly, once a day for a week, then increase to twice a day if tolerated. Here’s your prescription. Take with food, always with food. And increase your water intake. Now, I want to see you back in one month to check your blood sugar and see how you’re tolerating the medication. Do you have any other questions?
PATIENT: Yes, one question, Doctor. Are there any… foods I should avoid while taking this? Or any particular things I should watch out for, besides the… side effects you mentioned? And thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to see me.
DOCTOR: Avoid excessive alcohol. And honestly, try to eat healthier. Less processed food, more fruits and vegetables. It's not rocket science. As for watching out for things... if you experience severe stomach pain, nausea, or diarrhea, stop the medication and call my office immediately. Anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think that covers it. Thank you again for your time and advice. I’ll be sure to follow your instructions carefully. I won't take up any more of your valuable time.
DOCTOR: Alright. Good. Next patient. .
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. Goodbye. .
