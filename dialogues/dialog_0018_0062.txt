DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Knabenshue. My name is Dr. Lorana Stilaire. It’s a pleasure to meet you. I see you are here today. Could you tell me what brings you in?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor Stilaire. It is a pleasure to meet you too. Yes, well, it’s about something at work. I’m a Protective Service Worker, and… there’s been some changes to the rules regarding masks and personal protective equipment. I’m here to discuss getting an exemption, if possible. It’s causing me some trouble, and I'd like to explain.
DOCTOR: Thank you for explaining that, Mr. Knabenshue. Protective Services work is very important, and I understand how changes to safety protocols could be concerning. To help me understand your situation better, could you elaborate on the trouble you're experiencing with the new mask and PPE requirements?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. It's not a matter of…disliking them, understand. It’s just… they don’t fit properly. I’m a rather large man, six foot three, and most of the equipment seems made for…smaller individuals. The masks slip constantly, and the straps dig in. It makes it hard to breathe comfortably, and it’s distracting when I'm trying to do my job, ensuring the safety of others. I’ve tried different sizes, but nothing seems quite right. It feels… unsafe, to be honest, relying on gear that isn't secure. It’s causing me some anxiety, really.
DOCTOR: I understand perfectly, Mr. Knabenshue. It’s completely reasonable to be concerned about properly fitting PPE, especially in your line of work. A compromised fit does create a safety issue, and I appreciate you bringing this to my attention. To get a clearer picture, could you tell me specifically what type of masks and PPE you’ve been trying?
PATIENT: Well, they provided us with the standard N95 respirators, the ones with the headbands. And those surgical masks, the blue ones with the ear loops. I also tried one of those face shields, the plastic kind, but it kept fogging up, and it didn't feel very secure either. The headbands on the N95s dig into the back of my head, and the straps on the surgical masks, they stretch and pull on my ears. It’s… uncomfortable, to say the least, and I worry it's not providing the protection it should. I've tried adjusting the nose piece on the N95s, but it doesn’t seem to help much. Do you understand? It’s a matter of finding something that fits properly, and so far, nothing has.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand completely, Mr. Knabenshue. It sounds like you've been very diligent in trying different options. A poor fit with PPE is a common issue, and it's good that you're addressing it proactively. To assess this further, and to determine if an exemption is appropriate, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. Specifically, I want to measure your head circumference and facial dimensions. This will help us understand what sizes and types of PPE might work best for you. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly reasonable. I appreciate you taking the time to do that. Measuring would be much better than just… continuing to struggle with equipment that doesn’t fit. I’m happy to cooperate in any way that helps. Just let me know what you need me to do.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you don't mind, please remain seated. First, I’m going to measure the circumference of your head, just above your eyebrows and around the widest part of your head. Then, I'll measure the distance from the bridge of your nose to the tip of your chin, and the width of your face from temple to temple. It will only take a moment. Okay, your head circumference is 24 inches. The distance from the bridge of your nose to your chin is 8.5 inches, and the width of your face is 5.5 inches. Now, I’d also like to briefly examine your respiratory system – just listening to your lungs to ensure there aren't any underlying conditions that might be affected by mask use. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that’s perfectly acceptable. I don't have any known problems with my lungs, but I understand the need to check. I used to spend a lot of time outdoors as a boy, hunting and tracking with my grandfather. Strong lungs are important in my line of work as well. Go right ahead. I’ll do my best to remain still.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Knabenshue, your lung sounds are clear bilaterally. I hear normal breath sounds with no wheezes, crackles, or rhonchi. Your respiratory rate is 16 breaths per minute, and your oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. Given your measurements and the clear lung exam, it does seem that standard-sized PPE may not be adequate for you. There are some larger-sized options available, and we can explore those further. However, it’s also important to consider a fit test to ensure proper sealing, even with a larger size. Have you had a fit test previously?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I have not had a fit test before. That’s something my employer didn’t mention. They just provided the masks and said we needed to wear them. I hadn’t even thought about a “fit test” – what exactly does that involve? Is it uncomfortable? I just want to ensure I'm doing everything correctly, and that I'm adequately protected when I'm trying to help others. A mask that doesn’t fit properly feels… irresponsible, to be honest.
DOCTOR: That's a very valid concern, Mr. Knabenshue. A fit test is a simple procedure to ensure that the mask you're wearing creates a tight seal around your face, preventing air leakage. It involves wearing the mask and performing a series of movements – like talking, bending, and turning your head – while a technician uses a probe to detect any air leaks around the edges of the mask. It's not typically uncomfortable, although some people may find it a little claustrophobic at first. Unfortunately, I do not perform fit tests here at the clinic. However, I can provide you with a referral to a local occupational health facility that specializes in fit testing for healthcare and protective service workers. They will be able to assess your fit and recommend the appropriate type and size of mask for you. Would you like me to provide that referral?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, please do. That sounds like the best course of action. I'd like to get this resolved as quickly as possible, so I can be sure I’m doing my job safely and effectively. A referral to a facility that specializes in fit testing would be greatly appreciated. Thank you for taking the time to listen to my concerns and help me find a solution. It means a lot. I do have Medicare, if that affects the referral process.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Knabenshue. I’m happy to help. I've prepared a referral to [Name of Occupational Health Facility], and they do accept Medicare. Here is the referral form and contact information. They will contact you directly to schedule an appointment. In the meantime, I will document your concerns in your chart, and I recommend that you continue to use the masks provided by your employer, ensuring a tight fit as best as possible, until you have completed the fit test. Do you have any other questions or concerns that I can address today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I believe that covers everything. You've been very helpful and I appreciate your thoroughness. Knowing I have a referral to a specialist and that you’ve documented my concerns is a great relief. Thank you again for your time and assistance. I think I’m all set for now. I wish you a good day.
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Mr. Knabenshue. I am glad I could help. Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any further questions or concerns after your fit test. I wish you a good day as well, and thank you for your dedication to your important work. .
