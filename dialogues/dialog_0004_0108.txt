DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Gentz. I’m Dr. Deschane. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Look, I don't usually bother with doctors, but…well, things came up. Been throwing up blood, mostly. Not a ton, but enough to be… concerning, I guess. It started a couple days ago. Don't know what I did. Probably something I ate. Though I eat pretty clean, if I'm being honest.
DOCTOR: “Throwing up blood,” you say. And you’ve been experiencing this for two days now?
PATIENT: Yeah, two days. Maybe three. Honestly, I lose track. It’s not like a fountain, alright? More like…streaks. Red streaks. And it's dark red, not bright. Does that matter? I read something online about… well, never mind. It probably just means I shouldn't have had that spicy lamb last week. Though I doubt it. I rarely eat anything bad.
DOCTOR: Dark red streaks, you said. And you believe it may be related to something you ate?
PATIENT: Related is a strong word. Could be. Should be. Look, I take pretty good care of myself. I’m not one of these people who just… eats whatever. And it ain't like I've been hitting the bars, if that's what you're thinking. I mostly just eat at home. Simple stuff. This is…out of character. And uncomfortable, to say the least. My wife always said I had a cast-iron stomach. She was wrong, apparently.
DOCTOR: Alright. And has this been accompanied by any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… let me think. I’ve been a little tired, I guess. But who isn’t? It's August, it's hot. And…my stomach's been kinda… unsettled. Not cramping, just…off. And maybe a little weak. But honestly, I've been pushing myself pretty hard lately with…things around the house. It’s a big place, you know? My wife… she handled a lot of that. It's just me now.
DOCTOR: "Unsettled" stomach and weakness. Any nausea accompanying the vomiting, aside from the…blood?
PATIENT: Nausea? Yeah, a bit. It doesn't come with it, exactly. It's more like it lingers after. A queasy feeling. Like when you get off a boat, but not as bad. And it's not constant. It comes and goes. Look, I’m not a doctor, alright? I'm just trying to tell you what's happening. Is this going to involve a lot of poking and prodding? I really don’t care for that.
DOCTOR: I understand your discomfort, Mr. Gentz. However, to determine the cause of the vomiting and ensure there are no serious underlying issues, a physical exam is necessary. We'll start with listening to your abdomen and checking your vital signs. It’s a standard procedure. It will involve listening with a stethoscope and feeling your abdomen. Afterwards, I’d like to draw some blood for testing. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Blood tests…fine. Whatever you need to get this over with. But the poking and prodding… keep it minimal, alright? I’m not a fan of strangers touching me. And no talk about…feelings. Just tell me what’s wrong, fix it, and I'll be on my way. I have things to do. A big place needs a lot of attention, you know? My wife…
DOCTOR: Very well. Let’s begin with the vital signs. I'm going to take your blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. Then, I will listen to your abdomen with the stethoscope. It will be quick and as unobtrusive as possible. Please lie back on the examination table.
PATIENT: Fine, fine. But be gentle, alright? I haven’t been feeling myself lately, as you can probably tell. And don't expect me to be chatty. I'm not one for small talk. Just get it over with.
DOCTOR: Your blood pressure is 140 over 90. A bit elevated, but not critically high. Pulse is 88, regular. I'm listening to your abdomen now. Do you feel any pain or tenderness anywhere in particular?
PATIENT: Tenderness? Not really. A little…uneasy, maybe. It’s just…general discomfort. Like everything is off-kilter. It’s hard to explain. Look, I told you, I'm not a doctor. I don't know what's supposed to hurt and what's not. Just tell me what you find. And hurry it up, alright? I have things to do. My wife…
DOCTOR: I’m not detecting any acute tenderness, but there is some mild resistance in your upper left quadrant. It could be related to muscle tension or simply discomfort. Your abdomen sounds…hypoactive. That means the bowel sounds are a bit quieter than usual. I’m going to need to draw some blood now for a complete blood count and metabolic panel to assess your overall health and look for any signs of inflammation or organ dysfunction. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Hypoactive…great. More things wrong with me. Fine, draw the blood. Just… don't miss. I hate needles. And try to be quick about it. Honestly, I’ve had a long day already, and this isn’t making it any better. My wife… she always said I was a terrible patient.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Gentz. I'm going to clean the area with an alcohol swab, and then insert the needle. It will be a quick pinch, and then I'll collect the samples. Try to relax your arm. Deep breaths. We're almost finished. Just a few more tubes. Okay, all done. Please hold firm pressure on this gauze pad for the next five minutes to prevent any bruising. I'll have the lab results back within 24-48 hours. While we wait for the results, do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. Nothing I know of. I rarely take anything, actually. Always preferred to tough things out on my own. My wife… she always worried about me. Always told me I needed to take better care of myself. Look, is this going to be something serious? Just tell me straight. I don't need coddling. I just need to know what’s going on. And if it’s something bad, just tell me what we need to do. I can handle it. I’ve handled worse.
DOCTOR: Mr. Gentz, the cause of your symptoms is still unclear. The blood tests will help us determine if there is an underlying medical condition contributing to the vomiting and discomfort. It could be something as simple as a viral infection, or it could be something more serious, such as gastritis or a bleeding ulcer. I don't want to speculate without the results. However, given the presence of blood in your vomit, we need to rule out any significant internal bleeding. I'm going to order an upper endoscopy to visualize your esophagus, stomach, and duodenum. This will allow us to identify the source of the bleeding and determine the appropriate course of treatment. It's the most accurate way to diagnose the problem. Would you be willing to schedule that?
PATIENT: An endoscopy…you mean, putting a camera down my throat? Absolutely not. No way. I knew it. I knew this was going to be something awful. Look, I came in here with a little bit of stomach trouble, and now you're talking about shoving a camera down my throat? I'm not doing that. No. Just…no. I’ll just deal with it myself. I always have. My wife… she always tried to get me to go to the doctor, and I always refused. And I’m still refusing. Give me something for the nausea, and I'm leaving. Right now.
DOCTOR: Mr. Gentz, I understand your reluctance, but the upper endoscopy is crucial to determine the cause of the bleeding and prevent a potentially life-threatening complication. Without a diagnosis, we cannot effectively treat your condition. The bleeding could worsen, leading to anemia, shock, or even death. I strongly advise against refusing this procedure. However, I respect your autonomy. If you absolutely refuse the endoscopy, I will document your decision in your medical record. However, I must inform you that without a diagnosis, your prognosis is uncertain and your condition could deteriorate. Before you leave, I can prescribe a medication to help with the nausea. However, it will only address the symptom, not the underlying cause. Do you understand the risks of refusing the endoscopy?
PATIENT: Risks? Look, the only risk I see is letting you poke around inside me with a camera! Anemia, shock…you're just trying to scare me! I've lived a long life. I’ve handled worse than a little bit of blood. And frankly, I don’t trust you. You’re just looking for something to fix, something to bill my insurance for. No. I’m not doing it. Just give me the nausea pills. And I’m leaving. Right now. I’ll deal with it myself. Always have. My wife… she’s gone now. And I’m tired of being told what to do. Just…give me the pills.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Gentz. I will prescribe you promethazine for the nausea. However, I must reiterate that this is a temporary solution. If your symptoms worsen – if you experience increased bleeding, weakness, dizziness, or difficulty breathing – you must seek immediate medical attention. Here is a prescription for promethazine. Please take it as directed. And, again, if you experience any worsening symptoms, do not hesitate to go to the emergency room. I understand you are distressed, and I respect your autonomy. However, I strongly urge you to reconsider the endoscopy in the near future. Do you have any other questions for me before you leave?
