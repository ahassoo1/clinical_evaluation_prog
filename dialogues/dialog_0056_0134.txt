DOCTOR: Hi Raymonde, welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Amussen. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello dear. It's nice to meet you too. Well, it’s… this stomach trouble. It's been going on for a little while now. I get sick to my stomach a lot, and I don't seem to be able to eat much before I feel full. It's just…not right. I'm not sure how long exactly, things get a bit blurry these days, you know? But it's been worrying me.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s completely normal for things to feel a bit blurry as time goes on. Okay, so stomach trouble… nausea and feeling full quickly. And you said it’s been going on for “a little while.” Can you try to be a bit more specific?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Specific... that's hard. Let me think. It started… maybe around springtime? No, before that, I think. After my birthday, for sure. My birthday is in February. So… after February, definitely. A few months, at least. It’s not constant, it comes and goes, which is why it took me so long to come in. Some days it’s worse than others. Does that help at all? I apologize, I wish my memory was better.
DOCTOR: That does help, thank you. After February, a few months… so, roughly around springtime, with it coming and going. Okay. And when it does happen – the nausea and feeling full – is there anything specific you were eating or doing beforehand?
PATIENT: Hmm… not that I've noticed, really. I try to eat pretty light these days. Mostly soups and things. My daughter, bless her heart, makes me little casseroles sometimes. It happens with those too, though. And it's not just after a big meal, sometimes it's just… randomly. I had it this morning, actually, with just a little toast and tea. I don't think it's what I'm eating, if that makes sense. It just… happens. It's very strange.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it doesn't seem to be linked to a specific food. That’s helpful to know. And it's been happening even with small meals like toast and tea. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the nausea and fullness?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think... Well, I've been feeling a bit tired lately. More tired than usual, I suppose. And I haven't been… well, my appetite hasn't been very good, even before the nausea. I've lost a little weight, I think. My clothes feel a bit looser, but I haven't actually weighed myself. Oh, and sometimes, I get a little… shaky. Just a little bit, though. Not all the time. Is that important? I'm sorry, I’m probably rambling.
DOCTOR: No, you’re not rambling at all, Raymonde. That’s all very important information. Fatigue, decreased appetite, some weight loss, and shakiness… Okay. Have you experienced any changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Now you’re asking about… things I don’t usually talk about. Let me see… I haven't been… regular, if you know what I mean. More constipated than usual. It’s not comfortable. And… sometimes there's a little bit of blood, but it's not much. Just a spot, really. I thought it was just from straining, you know? But it's worried me a bit, so I figured I should come see someone. I’m sorry, this is all a bit unpleasant to talk about.
DOCTOR: It's okay, Raymonde, you’re doing great. It's important to be thorough, and I understand it’s not easy talking about these things. Blood in the stool, even a small amount, is something we need to investigate. And the constipation is good to know. Now, just to go over some general history… do you have any known allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, allergies... let me see. I don’t think so. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything, not that I remember. I used to be able to eat anything! But it’s been so long. I don't think I'm allergic to anything, but I haven't exactly been trying new things lately, you know? My daughter always checks things before I eat them, just in case. I take a little pill for my blood pressure, that’s all. No problems with that one.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. You take a medication for blood pressure, no issues with that. Do you mind if I ask what the name of that medication is?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… It’s a little white pill. My daughter fills my prescriptions, she handles all of that. I think it starts with an ‘A’… amlodipine? Is that right? Yes, I believe that's it. Amlodipine. I take one every morning with my breakfast. She says it's important.
DOCTOR: Okay, amlodipine once daily. That’s good to know. Now, do you have any other medical conditions that have been diagnosed in the past – anything like diabetes, heart problems, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see. I had my gallbladder out years ago, a long time ago. And… I had a bit of arthritis in my hands, but it’s not too bad. Mostly just a little stiff in the mornings. Oh! And the doctor said I have high cholesterol, so I take a statin with my amlodipine. My daughter says it’s very important to take them both. I think that’s it… nothing else major, as far as I know. I try to stay healthy, you know? I used to walk a lot, but it’s gotten harder lately.
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder removed, some arthritis, and high cholesterol managed with a statin – and you take that with the amlodipine. Do you remember the name of the statin?
PATIENT: Oh dear, now you’re really testing my memory! Let me think… it's a little yellow pill. I think it starts with a 'S'… simvastatin? Is that right? Yes, I believe that’s it. Simvastatin. My daughter says it's very important to take it with the amlodipine every morning. She worries about me, bless her heart. She keeps me on track with everything.
DOCTOR: Okay, simvastatin with your amlodipine. You have a very good daughter looking after you. Now, has anyone in your family had any serious medical problems, like cancer, heart disease, or diabetes?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s a good question. Let me see… My mother, she had… heart trouble, I think. She passed away when I was young, so I don’t remember much. And my brother, he had… diabetes, yes. He had it for a long time. And… my aunt, she had cancer. Breast cancer, I believe. That was a long time ago. It’s all a bit blurry, you know? It was a long time ago, and there were so many of us. I apologize, I wish I could remember more details. My memory isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Raymonde. You’ve given me a lot of good information. History of heart trouble in your mother, diabetes in your brother, and breast cancer in an aunt. Now, just a few more questions before we move on to a physical exam. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: Oh, no, never! Never smoked a day in my life. My husband, bless his soul, he smoked for a long time, but I always told him to go outside. It’s a terrible habit. I always made sure my daughter didn’t either. We were very careful about that. No, never smoked. Absolutely not.
DOCTOR: Okay, never smoked. Do you drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Just a little bit sometimes. A glass of wine with dinner, maybe once or twice a week. Nothing too much. I used to have a little bit more, but I've cut back. My daughter says it's better for my health. Just a little bit now and then, that's all. Nothing to worry about, I don’t think.
DOCTOR: Okay, a little bit of wine occasionally. And finally, can you tell me a bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Well, I mostly stay at home these days. I used to be very active, I loved gardening and walking, but it’s gotten harder lately with my arthritis and… well, just feeling tired all the time. I spend a lot of time reading, and watching television. My daughter comes over a lot, bless her heart. She helps me with the cooking and cleaning. I have a little cat, Mittens, she keeps me company. It's a quiet life, mostly. I don’t go out much anymore. It’s a bit lonely sometimes, but I manage. I try to stay positive. I used to volunteer at the local animal shelter, but I had to stop when I started feeling so tired. I miss that.
DOCTOR: Okay, a quieter life these days, spending time at home with your cat, and enjoying reading. It sounds like you're doing your best to stay engaged despite feeling tired. Alright Raymonde, thank you for answering all of those questions. Now I'd like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a better sense of what's going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, dear, that's perfectly alright. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. Just let me know if it’s going to be uncomfortable. My bones aren't what they used to be, you know. But do what you need to do. I want to feel better.
DOCTOR: Of course. I'll be gentle. First, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs with the stethoscope. Just breathe normally. Okay, your heart sounds regular, a little bit of a murmur, but that's not uncommon for someone your age. Lungs sound clear. Now, I'm going to feel your abdomen. Just relax, and let me know if anything feels tender. Okay, a little bit of tenderness down here. Not too bad, but I'll make a note of it. Now, I'm just going to check your reflexes.
PATIENT: Oh, alright. That tickled a little bit! My tummy is a bit sensitive sometimes, so that doesn’t surprise me. It’s good you checked. Is that bad? The tenderness, I mean. I always get a little worried when someone pokes around in there. It just feels… fragile, you know? Is that something I should be concerned about? I’m sorry, I probably shouldn’t ask so many questions. I just like to know what’s going on.
DOCTOR: It's perfectly alright to ask questions, Raymonde! That’s what I'm here for. The tenderness is mild, and it doesn't necessarily mean anything serious. It could just be a bit of muscle strain, or some sensitivity in the bowel. But we need to investigate a little further to rule out anything more significant, especially with the blood you mentioned in your stool. Okay, reflexes are a little bit slower than usual, which is also normal for your age. Blood pressure is a little bit elevated, but consistent with your medication. Now, I'm going to listen to your tummy again with the stethoscope. Sounds… a little bit quiet, actually. I'd like to get some blood work done and also a stool sample to check for any abnormalities. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. More tests... I suppose that’s to be expected. Blood work and a stool sample, yes, that's fine. Whatever you need. Just… is it something serious, doctor? You said something about abnormalities. Should I be worried? My daughter always worries so much, and I don’t want to upset her. It’s just… I feel tired all the time, and now you’re talking about abnormalities. It’s all a bit overwhelming. It’s probably nothing, right? Just a little bit of muscle strain?
DOCTOR: It’s completely understandable to be worried, Raymonde, and you’re right to ask questions. I want to be upfront with you – the quiet bowel sounds and the tenderness, along with the blood in your stool, do warrant further investigation. However, that doesn’t necessarily mean it’s something serious. It could be a number of things, like a minor infection, inflammation, or even just a blockage. The blood work will help us rule out infection and check your overall health, and the stool sample will look for any signs of bleeding or abnormalities. It's important to be thorough, especially with your symptoms and family history. I don't want to alarm you, and I’m not going to jump to any conclusions. These tests are simply a precaution, and we’ll discuss the results as soon as they come back. I'm going to order those tests now. The nurse will explain how to collect the stool sample, and we can draw the blood here at the clinic. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Tests are tests, I suppose. I just want to feel better, that's all. I understand you need to be thorough. A quiet bowel and tenderness… and the blood. It’s just… frightening to hear all of that. But you're right, it's probably nothing. Just a precaution. Yes, alright. I can do that. The stool sample and the blood work. The nurse will help me, you said? That's good. I'm not very good at these things on my own. Thank you, doctor. I appreciate you explaining everything so carefully. It helps to know what's going on, even if it's a little scary. I'm just… tired. So, very tired. I hope we can figure out what’s going on soon.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Raymonde. It’s completely understandable to feel tired and overwhelmed. We'll do everything we can to figure out what's going on and get you feeling better. I'll write up the orders for the tests now. The nurse will come in shortly to explain the stool sample collection and draw your blood. It shouldn't take long. In the meantime, I'm going to write you a prescription for a mild stool softener. It might help with the constipation while we wait for the test results. Here’s the prescription. And please, don't hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or concerns before your test results come back. We’re here to help. Do you have any questions for me before the nurse comes in?
PATIENT: Oh, a stool softener... that sounds nice. Anything to help with that. No, I don’t think I have any other questions right now. Just... thank you again, doctor. You’ve been very kind. And patient. It’s easy to get flustered, you know? Especially when you’re my age. I appreciate you taking the time to listen. I suppose I’ll just sit here and wait for the nurse then. Thank you.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Raymonde. Take your time, and don't hesitate to ask the nurse if you need anything at all. I'll be right down the hall if you need me. We’ll get to the bottom of this, and we’ll get you feeling better soon.
