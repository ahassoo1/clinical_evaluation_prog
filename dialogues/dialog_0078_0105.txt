DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kochubey. My name is Dr. Solero. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. Could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Um… well, it’s about getting surgery. For my weight, I mean. I think my wife set all this up, to be honest. I don’t remember all the details, but she said it’s to help me lose some weight… a bariatric surgery, I think she called it?
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It sounds like your wife has been doing some research and is interested in exploring bariatric surgery as an option for you. That’s very thoughtful of her. Just to confirm, and to get a better understanding, are you primarily interested in weight loss, or are there other health concerns that prompted this consultation?
PATIENT: Honestly? Mostly just the weight. It’s… it’s been getting harder to do things. Just moving around, you know? I get tired easily. I don't really feel sick, if that makes sense. No big problems, just… heavy. I guess my wife is worried about things becoming big problems, and she read somewhere this surgery could help. I trust her. I just... don’t really remember why exactly she was so worried.
DOCTOR: I see. It sounds like you're experiencing limitations with your daily activities due to your weight, and your wife is proactively seeking solutions to prevent potential future health issues. That's good awareness. To help me understand the situation better, and to ensure this is a suitable option for you, I'd like to ask a few questions about your medical history. First, have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, such as diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Um… that’s a good question. I… honestly, I don’t really remember. I’ve been to the doctor before, of course, for check-ups, but nothing… serious, I don’t think. My wife usually handles all that paperwork. She’d definitely know. I think I’m okay, but I really can’t say for sure. Would it help if she came in to tell you? I don’t want to give you the wrong information.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Mr. Kochubey. It’s very common for patients to not recall specific details of their medical history, and it’s always best to be thorough. Having your wife join us would be very helpful, if that's possible. In the meantime, let’s see if we can get some basic information. Do you currently take any medications – prescription or over-the-counter – or any supplements?
PATIENT: No, not really. Just… sometimes I take something for headaches. Like, ibuprofen, or something. Nothing regularly, though. Only when I really need it. And… vitamins, I guess. My wife makes sure I take a multivitamin. But that’s about it. I really don’t like taking pills, if I can avoid it.
DOCTOR: Okay, ibuprofen as needed for headaches and a multivitamin. That's good to know. Now, have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I… I had my tonsils out when I was a kid, I think. That’s all I can remember. A long time ago. I don’t think I’ve had any surgeries since then. Nothing major, anyway. My wife would know for sure, she remembers everything! I'm sorry I'm not very helpful with this.
DOCTOR: You are doing just fine, Mr. Kochubey. It's completely understandable to not remember every detail. Now, can you tell me a little bit about your family's medical history?
PATIENT: Oh… family history. That’s… tricky. My parents, they… they passed away a while ago. I don’t really know much about their health, to be honest. We weren’t very close. I think my mom had… high blood pressure, maybe? But I’m really not sure. My wife knows my family better than I do. She’s always asking about it. She’s good at remembering these things. It's a blur to me, I'm afraid.
DOCTOR: I understand. That's perfectly alright. It's not always easy to recall family medical history, especially when you weren't closely connected. Okay, let’s switch gears a little. Could you tell me about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle? Um… well, I work at a retail store, mostly standing around. It's not very active, I guess. I drive to work. I try to eat… reasonably well. My wife does most of the cooking, so it’s usually pretty healthy food. I don't really exercise much, I'm ashamed to admit. I get tired easily, like I said before. It's a bit of a cycle, I guess. I wish I was more active, but… it's hard.
DOCTOR: That gives me a good picture. It sounds like your job isn’t very physically demanding and you could benefit from incorporating more activity into your routine. Now, do you smoke, or use any tobacco products?
PATIENT: No, never. I don't smoke, and I don't use any tobacco products. My wife hates smoking, so I've always stayed away from it. It’s bad for your health, she always says! She’s very… health-conscious. I try to listen to her.
DOCTOR: That's excellent. Now, how about alcohol?
PATIENT: Um… I have a beer sometimes. With dinner, maybe. Or on the weekends. Not a lot, though. Just one or two. My wife will have a glass of wine occasionally too. We don’t really drink much. It's not really a habit, more of a… social thing, I guess. Nothing excessive.
DOCTOR: Okay, so occasional, moderate alcohol consumption. Alright, Mr. Kochubey, that gives me a good general understanding of your history. Now, if you don't mind, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, just to get some baseline measurements and check your overall health. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s fine. Whatever you need. I trust your judgment, Doctor. My wife always says it's good to get checked out. I just… hope it's not too bad. I'm a bit nervous, I guess. But if you think it's a good idea, then let’s do it.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright to be nervous, Mr. Kochubey. We'll take things one step at a time. First, let's check your height and weight. Okay, your height is 5’8”, and your weight is 245 pounds. Now, let's check your blood pressure and pulse. Your blood pressure is 145/90, and your pulse is 88 beats per minute. Now, I’m just going to listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds are regular, and your lungs are clear. Finally, I’ll just take a quick look in your ears, nose, and throat. Everything looks normal in your ears, nose and throat. Overall, everything appears within normal limits for a preliminary exam. Now, to determine if you are a suitable candidate for bariatric surgery, we’ll need to run some blood tests and possibly some imaging studies. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds… okay. Blood tests and imaging… whatever you need. My wife said something about that, I think. As long as it helps figure things out. I trust you, Doctor. Just… let me know if anything is seriously wrong, okay? I don’t want any surprises. I'm mostly just hoping to feel better, that's all.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Kochubey. We'll take it one step at a time and I'll explain everything clearly along the way. We’ll order a comprehensive metabolic panel to check your kidney and liver function, as well as a lipid panel to assess your cholesterol levels. We'll also order a complete blood count to check for any underlying infections or anemia. And finally, we'll order an EKG to evaluate your heart rhythm. The lab will contact you to schedule an appointment for the blood draw. I will also order a chest X-ray to get a baseline image of your lungs. We will schedule that here at the clinic. Once we have the results, we'll review them together and discuss the best course of action. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds… good. Chest X-ray, blood tests… everything. I trust you, Doctor. As long as it helps me figure things out. My wife will probably want to come to that review appointment too, if that's okay? She’s good at asking questions I forget to ask. And, um… just let me know if anything seems really bad, okay? I get worried easily.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Kochubey. Your wife is more than welcome to join us for the review appointment. In fact, I encourage it. It’s always helpful to have a second set of ears and a support system during these discussions. And I assure you, I will explain everything thoroughly and answer all your questions, and your wife’s, to the best of my ability. We won’t move forward with any procedures until we’ve fully assessed your health and discussed all the risks and benefits. For now, I will give you a requisition form for the blood tests and schedule the chest X-ray for next week. Here is also a handout explaining the preparation for the blood tests. Do you have any questions for me before we wrap up?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s everything. You explained everything really well, Doctor. My wife will probably have a lot of questions, but I don’t think I do right now. Just… thank you. For taking the time to listen to me. And for not making me feel… stupid, for not remembering things. I appreciate it. I'll let my wife know about the appointment schedule and the blood tests. .
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Mr. Kochubey. It was my pleasure. Please don't hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any questions or concerns before your appointment. And please, don’t worry about not remembering things. It’s perfectly normal. We’re here to help, and we’ll take things at your pace. I look forward to seeing you both next week. Have a good day. .
