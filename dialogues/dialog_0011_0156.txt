DOCTOR: Good morning, Jase. My name is Dr. Christopher Neppl. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Oh, hi Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Um… well, it’s my stomach, I think. It’s been… not good, lately. I keep getting diarrhea. It’s been going on for a bit, but it feels worse now. Honestly, I can’t really remember when it started exactly. It just… is.
DOCTOR: I see. Diarrhea can certainly be disruptive. You mentioned it's been going on for "a bit," and you’re having trouble pinpointing when it began. That’s alright; we'll try to get a better understanding of it. Could you describe the diarrhea itself?
PATIENT: Hmm… how to describe it… It’s, well, watery. Really watery. And… frequent. I have to go a lot. Sometimes it’s just a few times a day, but other times… well, it’s pretty much constant. And it's… uncomfortable, obviously. I try not to leave the house when it's bad. I don't really remember if there’s anything in it, to be honest. Sorry, that’s probably gross. I just… don't pay attention to those details.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly alright; these details are important, and you're not being impolite at all. It sounds quite uncomfortable, and I appreciate you sharing that with me. You mentioned it varies in frequency. On a typical day, when it's not constant, roughly how many times would you say you're experiencing diarrhea?
PATIENT: Oh, um… let me think. On a good day, maybe… three or four times? But it really changes. Like, some days it’s just a couple, and then other days… like yesterday, it was probably eight or nine. I lost count, honestly. It’s hard to keep track when you’re… occupied. It’s also worse after I eat, I think. But everything makes it worse, so… I don’t really know.
DOCTOR: I understand. That's a significant change in bowel habits, and the variability is certainly concerning. The association with eating is a key piece of information. To help me get a clearer picture, could you describe what you typically eat in a day?
PATIENT: Oh, gosh. That's a hard question. My husband does most of the cooking, so I don't always know exactly what's in everything. But… we eat a lot of Pakistani food, obviously. Curry, rice, roti… things like that. He makes really good biryani. We try to eat healthy, lots of vegetables, but… sometimes we get takeout. Pizza, burgers, that kind of thing. I drink a lot of tea, too. Black tea, mostly. And water, I guess. I really don't pay much attention to what I eat, to be honest. It all just… tastes good.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Jase. It's helpful to know generally what your diet consists of. Pakistani cuisine is delicious, and it doesn’t sound like you have any particularly restrictive eating habits. Now, have you experienced any other symptoms alongside the diarrhea?
PATIENT: Um… let me think. Sometimes my stomach cramps. Bad cramps, really. And… I feel tired a lot. Just really, really tired. I thought it was just because I’ve been busy, but… maybe it’s related? I haven't really noticed anything else, I don't think. No fever, no nausea… Just the cramps and the tiredness, and, of course, the… everything else.
DOCTOR: Okay, the cramps and fatigue are important pieces of the puzzle. Let’s move on to your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That's a good question. Um… I think I had… something with my stomach a long time ago? When I was a kid, maybe? I don’t really remember. The doctors did a lot of tests, and then… I think they said something about my intestines? But honestly, my memory is really bad. My husband usually handles all the doctor stuff, so I don't really keep track of things. I know I've had the usual things, like colds and the flu, but… nothing major, I think. I do have Medicare, if that matters. And I am married, like I said before. I don’t… I don’t think I have any serious health problems.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Jase. It’s common for details to be fuzzy, and it's good your husband helps manage your healthcare. The mention of something with your intestines as a child is worth noting, and we may need to look into that further. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. Definitely not. I… I would remember that, right? No surgeries. I've never been in the hospital, except when I had my tonsils out when I was little, but that was ages ago. That doesn’t really count, does it? It was a long time ago, and I was so young. I don't remember anything about it. Honestly, I mostly just go to the doctor for check-ups and things like that. I try to avoid it if I can.
DOCTOR: No, a tonsillectomy as a child doesn’t count as a major surgery in this context. It's good to know you haven't had any other surgical procedures. Now, are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s a tough one. My family is pretty big, and I don’t really… keep up with everyone’s health. My grandmother, on my mother’s side, she had… something with her stomach, I think? But I don’t know what it was. My father has high blood pressure, I know that much. And my brother has… allergies, I think? But honestly, I’m not very good at remembering things like that. We don't really talk about health a lot. It’s… a bit of a taboo subject, I guess.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s alright if you don't have specific details. Knowing there's a history of a stomach condition in your grandmother and high blood pressure in your father is helpful. Do you have any allergies to medications or anything else, such as food or environmental factors?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything. I take… I don’t really take any medications regularly. Just over-the-counter pain relievers sometimes, for headaches. And I haven’t noticed any problems with food. I eat pretty much everything. Or, I used to, before all this… everything. I haven’t been around anything unusual, like poison ivy or anything. I don’t think I’m allergic to anything. Honestly, I’m pretty lucky in that regard.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. Now, let's talk a bit about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, no, definitely not. I don’t smoke. And I rarely drink alcohol. Maybe a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, but that’s it. And I definitely don’t use any drugs. Never have. My husband doesn’t drink or smoke either. We try to live a pretty healthy lifestyle. Or, we used to, before all this… everything.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s very helpful. Now, before we proceed to a physical exam, is there anything else you think I should know about your current situation?
PATIENT: Hmm… well, I’ve been feeling really stressed lately. Work has been… hectic. And I’ve been worried about my mother, she hasn’t been feeling well. I don’t know if that’s related to… everything, but it feels like it might be. I’ve also noticed that… well, it's silly, but I've been losing weight. Not a lot, but enough that my husband noticed. He keeps telling me to eat more, but… I just don’t have much of an appetite. And… I’m just tired all the time. Like, really, really tired. It’s hard to explain. I just feel… off.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Jase. Stress and worry can definitely contribute to gastrointestinal issues, and the weight loss is a concerning symptom that we need to investigate further. It’s good that your husband has noticed; it's important to have someone looking out for you. Now, I'd like to perform a physical examination. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you think is best. I… I just want to feel better.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Your vital signs are within normal limits. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Next, I’ll palpate your abdomen. There’s some tenderness in the lower abdomen, but no palpable masses. I'll check for rebound tenderness. No rebound tenderness noted. Now, I'm going to perform a quick neurological exam to assess your reflexes and sensation. Reflexes are normal and sensation is intact. Based on this initial examination, there are no obvious signs of a serious acute condition. However, the tenderness in your lower abdomen and the weight loss are concerning. Do you have any questions about the exam so far?
PATIENT: No, that all sounds… okay, I guess. It doesn't sound bad, but… I still don't feel good. What does the tenderness mean? And what about the weight loss? Should I be worried? I feel like I’m just going in circles.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Jase. It’s perfectly valid to feel anxious when you’re not feeling well and don't have a clear answer. The tenderness in your lower abdomen could indicate inflammation or irritation of the intestinal tract, which is consistent with your symptoms of diarrhea. The weight loss is also concerning as it could indicate malabsorption of nutrients, or potentially other underlying issues. At this point, to get a clearer picture of what’s going on, I’d like to order some laboratory tests. These will include a complete blood count to check for infection or anemia, a comprehensive metabolic panel to assess your kidney and liver function, and a stool sample analysis to look for any bacteria, parasites, or blood in your stool. I also want to check your vitamin D levels and thyroid function, as deficiencies in these areas can sometimes cause similar symptoms. Would you be comfortable with those tests?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that sounds good. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just want to know what’s wrong, and how to fix it. So, yes, please. All of those tests sound fine.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I’ll write the orders for those tests now. The lab is just down the hall. They will collect the samples. It's best to avoid eating or drinking anything for at least eight hours before the stool sample, so you may need to adjust your meal times. The other tests don’t require any special preparation. While we await the results, I recommend you continue to stay hydrated by drinking plenty of fluids, such as water or electrolyte solutions. I also suggest you eat small, frequent meals, focusing on easily digestible foods, such as bananas, rice, applesauce, and toast – the BRAT diet. In the meantime, I’d like to discuss some potential causes for your symptoms, but it’s important to remember that we need the test results before we can make a definitive diagnosis. Do you have any questions before we proceed?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. BRAT diet… I’ll try to remember that. It sounds… bland, but if it helps, I’ll do it. What are some of the things it could be? You mentioned potential causes. I’m not sure I want to know if it's something terrible, but… I’d rather be prepared, I guess.
DOCTOR: I understand your apprehension, Jase. It’s natural to feel worried about potential causes. There are several possibilities we need to consider. The most common causes of chronic diarrhea include infections, food intolerances, irritable bowel syndrome , inflammatory bowel disease – such as Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis – and celiac disease. Less common, but important to rule out, are certain medications, malabsorption syndromes, and rarely, colon cancer. However, it’s important to stress that these are just possibilities, and we don’t have enough information to make a diagnosis yet. The laboratory tests will help us narrow down the possibilities and determine the most appropriate course of action. Given your weight loss and fatigue, I also want to discuss the possibility of referral to a gastroenterologist, a specialist in digestive health. They can perform further testing, such as a colonoscopy or endoscopy, if needed, to get a more detailed look at your intestinal tract. Would you be comfortable with a referral if the initial tests warrant it?
PATIENT: A colonoscopy… that sounds… scary. But, if you think it’s necessary, then yes, I guess. I just want to feel better. If the tests say I need it, then I’ll do it. It just… sounds unpleasant. But I trust your judgment, Doctor.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Jase. A colonoscopy isn’t the most pleasant procedure, but it’s a very safe and effective way to diagnose and treat many digestive conditions. It’s performed under sedation, so you won’t feel any pain during the procedure. For now, let’s focus on getting the initial lab tests completed. Once we have the results, we can discuss them in detail and determine the next steps. I’ll also provide you with a written summary of our conversation today, including the test orders and instructions. Do you have any other questions or concerns before we finish?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you, Doctor. I really appreciate you taking the time to listen to me and explain everything so clearly. I feel a little less anxious now, knowing that we have a plan.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Jase. I’m glad I could help alleviate some of your anxiety. Remember, I'm here to support you throughout this process. Please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic if you experience any worsening of your symptoms, such as severe abdominal pain, bloody stools, or fever. Here's the lab requisition form and a summary of our discussion. We'll schedule a follow-up appointment to review the results once they are available. In the meantime, please take care and focus on staying hydrated and following the dietary recommendations. Have a good day, Jase.
