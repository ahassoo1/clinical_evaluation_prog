DOCTOR: Right. Mr. Bahta, is it?
PATIENT: Yes, that is correct. Lonell Bahta. It is a pleasure to meet you, Doctor… M-u-r-t-i-c, if I recall correctly? I apologize if my pronunciation is incorrect.
DOCTOR: It's pronounced Mur-teek. And please, don’t bother with formalities. So, Mr. Bahta, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Ah, yes, Mur-teek. Thank you for the correction. I am here… well, my solicitor suggested I come for a certification. Something about home health… or hospice eligibility? I confess, I am not entirely clear on the details. It involves care at home, I believe.
DOCTOR: Right. A certification. Honestly, the paperwork these days… So, your solicitor thinks you might qualify for some level of home care assistance?
PATIENT: Yes, precisely. I… I have been finding things a little difficult lately. Nothing drastic, you understand. Just… tiring, more easily. And my daughter, bless her heart, she works very long hours. She suggested I explore options for assistance. It’s more for her peace of mind, I think, than anything else. I am still quite capable, you see.
DOCTOR: “Quite capable,” right. And what specifically is becoming “difficult,” Mr. Bahta?
PATIENT: Well, for example, the stairs. They are… becoming a challenge. And I used to enjoy gardening, but bending and kneeling… it’s not as easy as it once was. Small things, really. But they add up, you see. And cooking… preparing a proper meal takes considerably longer than it used to. I find myself relying on… simpler options these days.
DOCTOR: Let's have a look at your chart. Height 159… weight 116… That’s… a bit low, isn’t it?
PATIENT: Yes, it is, I believe. I have always been… slight of build. I eat regularly, though perhaps not as heartily as I once did. It has not been a concern to my general practitioner, but I can see how it might be noted. I assure you, I am otherwise in good health, for a man of my age.
DOCTOR: And are you currently taking any medications, Mr. Bahta?
PATIENT: Just a small dose of lisinopril, for my blood pressure. Twenty milligrams, once a day. It has been prescribed for several years now. And occasionally, a paracetamol for a headache, but nothing regular, I assure you.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any allergies we should be aware of?
PATIENT: No, not that I am aware of. I have never experienced any adverse reactions to any foods or medications. My daughter always asks, of course, when I visit the pharmacy, but I always respond negatively. It has always been the same. No allergies, to my knowledge.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, let's do a quick physical exam, shall we?
PATIENT: Certainly. Whatever you deem necessary, Doctor. I am happy to cooperate in any way I can. Please, lead the way. I trust this will not be too… disruptive? I do not have a great deal of stamina these days, you see.
DOCTOR: It won't be extensive, Mr. Bahta. Just a basic assessment. Please, have a seat on the examination table. We’ll start with your blood pressure, just to confirm what your GP has been monitoring. And then we’ll listen to your heart and lungs. Nothing to worry about.
PATIENT: Very good. I shall endeavour to remain still. As you wish, Doctor. Please do not hesitate to inform me if I am doing something incorrectly. I am not accustomed to these… procedures, you understand.
DOCTOR: Just relax. 130 over 80. Not bad, but we’ll want to take it again in a moment. Now, breathe deeply for me… Lungs are clear. Heart sounds… regular, a slight murmur, but not concerning for your age. Now, let's check your reflexes.
PATIENT: Very good, Doctor. Everything seems to be proceeding smoothly. I do hope I am not being too much trouble. I am not, shall we say, a particularly… robust patient. Oh! That's a little… sensitive.
DOCTOR: That’s…expected, given your weight. Now, stand up, please. Let’s see how you do with balance. Hmm. A little unsteady. Could be the weight, could be age. Now, can you walk a few steps for me?
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. I confess, my balance is not what it once was. It is… a gradual process, you understand. Not a sudden decline, thankfully. I used to be a very active walker, but now… it requires more effort. And a great deal more concentration. Is that sufficient?
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, a quick neurological assessment. I'm going to ask you a few simple questions. Can you tell me what year it is?
PATIENT: Certainly. It is, of course, 2025. August 2nd, to be precise. I pride myself on my memory, Doctor. It has always been a… strong suit. I remember details most people would forget. Though, occasionally, names escape me. A minor inconvenience, I assure you.
DOCTOR: And can you repeat three words for me?
PATIENT: Certainly. Please proceed, Doctor. I am ready when you are. I have no reason to believe I will encounter any difficulty with such a simple task. My mind is, for the most part, quite sharp, despite my… physical limitations.
DOCTOR: Apple… Table… Penny. Repeat those for me.
PATIENT: Apple… Table… and Penny. Yes, quite straightforward. Is that correct? I believe I have successfully recalled the words in the correct order. I sometimes find it helpful to visualize them… a red apple, a sturdy table, a shiny penny.
DOCTOR: Apple…Penny…Book. Did you say Book?
PATIENT: Apple… Penny… Hmm. No, that is incorrect. I distinctly remember saying Table. Apple… Penny… Table. Are you certain you heard correctly, Doctor? My apologies if I am being… difficult, but I am quite confident in my recollection.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, Mr. Bahta, based on this brief assessment, and considering your weight and reported difficulties with stairs and gardening, there are a few possibilities we need to explore. There's a degree of generalized weakness, which could be addressed with physical therapy. And given the slight difficulty with recall, we should rule out any cognitive impairment. I’m going to order some blood work to check your vitamin levels and thyroid function. And I want you to see a neurologist for a more comprehensive cognitive evaluation.
