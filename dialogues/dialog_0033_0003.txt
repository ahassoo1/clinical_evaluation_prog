DOCTOR: Right. Mr. Baide, is it?
PATIENT: Yeah, that's me. Look, doc, can we just get this over with? I got things to do, you know. August second already… time flies when you’re… well, never mind. What do you need to know?
DOCTOR: Efficient, I see. Very well. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Tremor. That’s what my daughter told me to come in for. My hands… they shake. Been happening for a bit now. Honestly, I don't remember when exactly it started. Old age, probably. Everything shakes eventually.
DOCTOR: "A bit now" isn't terribly helpful, Mr. Baide. But alright. Is it constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Come and go, I guess. Mostly when I’m… trying to do something. Like, holding a fork. Or signing my name. Used to be a pretty good signature, mind you. Not now, though. All scribbles. Look, are you writing all this down? It feels like an interrogation.
DOCTOR: Of course I'm writing it down, Mr. Baide. It's called taking a history. Do you notice anything that makes it worse?
PATIENT: Worse? Hmm… Coffee, maybe? I like my coffee. Strong. Used to drink a whole pot, back in the day. Not as much now. Though… I can't really say for sure. It just happens. It’s annoying, is what it is. Really bothers me when I'm trying to eat.
DOCTOR: Alright. Any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms? What kind of symptoms? I feel… old, if that counts. A little tired sometimes. Everything aches, naturally. I don’t… I don't know what you expect me to say. I just want my hands to stop shaking!
DOCTOR: Right. Let’s try a quick examination, then. Could you extend your arms in front of you, palms up?
PATIENT: Ugh, alright. Fine. There. Happy now? See? Shaking. It’s not exactly a secret. Can I sit down? This is… undignified.
DOCTOR: Palmar tremor observed bilaterally, approximately 4-6 Hz. Reflexes 2+ bilaterally. Muscle tone slightly increased. It appears to be a resting tremor, Mr. Baide. Have you noticed any stiffness, slowness in movement, or changes in your balance?
PATIENT: Resting tremor? What does that mean? And what's "bilaterally?" Look, doc, I’m not a doctor. And no, I haven’t noticed… changes in my balance. I walk fine. Mostly. Sometimes a little unsteady, but that’s just because I’m old! Stiffness… maybe a little in the mornings, but who doesn’t feel stiff in the mornings? This is all very… confusing.
DOCTOR: It means your hands shake when you’re not using them. And as for your questions... Have you ever had any head injuries?
PATIENT: Head injuries? Now you’re asking about things that happened fifty years ago! I… I don’t remember. Maybe a bump or two when I was a kid, playing ball. Nothing serious. I was a director, always running around on set… probably knocked my head a few times, truthfully. But nothing that would… cause this. Honestly, it's probably just nerves. All this talk about tremors… it's making me more shaky!
DOCTOR: Any family history of similar issues?
PATIENT: Similar issues? Now that’s a question. Let me think… My mother… she had shaky hands too, I think. Now that I recall, yes, she did. Always dropping things. But she lived to be ninety-five, so it couldn’t have been that bad. And my father… he was… well, he was a strong, silent type. Never complained about anything. I doubt he’d admit to having shaky hands if he did.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what medications are you currently taking?
PATIENT: Medications… Hmm. Let’s see. My daughter handles most of that now. I take something for my blood pressure… a little white pill, I think. And something for my… cholesterol? Oh, and a baby aspirin every day, she says it's good for my heart. Honestly, I don't keep track of it all. It’s a whole handful of pills.
DOCTOR: This is… not ideal, Mr. Baide. Do you know the names of any of these medications?
PATIENT: Look, doc, I'm eighty years old, not a pharmacist! I told you, my daughter manages it all. She's the organized one. Something… something with an 'A'? And a 'Z'? I don't know! Do I look like I remember these things? I just want to know what’s going to happen about my hands!
DOCTOR: Alright. Based on your history and examination, it is likely you are experiencing an essential tremor, possibly exacerbated by caffeine intake and… suboptimal medication management. I recommend a neurology consultation for further evaluation and potential treatment options. I'll have my nurse schedule that for you. And try to limit your coffee intake. It's probably contributing to the issue.
PATIENT: Neurology consultation? More doctors? Honestly, this is a mess. Fine. Whatever. Just get it over with. And I like my coffee! Maybe just… a little less. But no promises. Is that it? Can I go now? I've got a lunch appointment.
DOCTOR: Yes, that will be all. My nurse will give you instructions on scheduling the appointment. Try to get it done as soon as possible. And for your sake, consider cutting back on the coffee, Mr. Baide. Next. .
PATIENT: .
