DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Schneer. I’m Dr. Hembrey. It says here you're an 83-year-old male. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Schneer, yes, that's right. Well, it's my ears, you see. They just… aren’t what they used to be. Things are getting a bit muffled, and I have trouble hearing folks when they don’t speak up. It’s been goin’ on for a while now, I reckon. Not sure exactly how long, though. My memory isn't the best, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Schneer. Hearing difficulties are quite common at your age, but we need to determine the cause. “A while now” isn’t terribly specific, unfortunately. Can you try to recall when you first noticed the muffling?
PATIENT: Oh dear, that's a tricky one. Let me think… hmm. It wasn't last year, that I’m pretty sure of. Maybe… a couple of years ago? No, wait. It might have been after… well, after I stopped workin’. I worked at the shoe factory, you know. A long time ago now. Does that help any? It's all kinda blurry. I always liked the smell of the leather, though.
DOCTOR: So, potentially after retirement from the shoe factory… approximately how many years ago would that have been, Mr. Schneer?
PATIENT: Oh, land sakes. That was… a long time. Let me see. I think… forty? Forty years, maybe? Or was it closer to fifty? I’ve been livin’ on my own since then, mostly keepin’ to myself. It’s hard to say, really. Time just seems to slip away, don't it? I never did get married, either. Just me and my quiet life.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, approximately fifty years since retirement. And has this hearing difficulty been gradual, worsening over time, or has it come on more suddenly at any point?
PATIENT: Gradual, I think. It didn't just happen one day, you know? Just… slowly got harder to hear. Folks started mumblin’ more, or maybe I just couldn't catch what they were sayin’. It’s probably me, honestly. Always was a bit hard of hearin’, even when I was younger. My mother used to yell my name all the time! She had a strong voice, that woman did.
DOCTOR: Very well. And aside from the difficulty hearing, have you experienced any ringing in your ears, dizziness, pain, or any fluid draining from either ear?
PATIENT: Ringing… hmm. Sometimes, yes. A sort of… high-pitched whine, I suppose. Not all the time, though. Comes and goes. And no, no dizziness or pain. No drainin' nothin', either. Just the trouble hearin' and that little bit of ringin' now and then. It’s not too bad, mostly just annoying. Makes it hard to enjoy the radio, though. I like listenin' to music.
DOCTOR: I see. And are you currently taking any medications, Mr. Schneer?
PATIENT: Oh, good question. Let me think… Not really. Just a little somethin' for my… what do you call it? The water pills, the doctor gave me a while back. For my ankles, you know. They swell up sometimes. That's about it. I don't take much, thankfully. I try to stay healthy. Oatmeal every mornin', that’s my secret.
DOCTOR: Alright. Do you happen to know the name of those “water pills,” Mr. Schneer?
PATIENT: Oh dear… that's a tough one. I just ask the fella at the pharmacy to give me the same ones I always get. Little white pills, I think? They come in a orange bottle. I’m afraid I’m not very good with names, you know. I mostly just let the professionals handle that sort of thing. It’s all a bit confusing for an old man like me!
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Schneer. Before we proceed, I'm going to ask a few questions about your medical history. Have you ever been hospitalized for any serious illnesses?
PATIENT: Hospitalized... hmm. Let me think. When I was a boy, I had a bad case of the measles. But that was a long, long time ago. And… oh! When I broke my wrist fallin’ off a ladder. Repairin’ the roof, you see. That was… maybe twenty years ago? Other than that, I’ve mostly stayed outta trouble, health-wise. Knock on wood!
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you ever had any major surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries... I had my appendix out when I was young. That's all I can think of. And…oh! They took out some bad skin spots, a few years back. On my face, you see. Just little things, really. Nothing major. They didn’t even hurt too bad. Mostly just a bit of bother afterwards. Nothing to write home about.
DOCTOR: And what about your family history, Mr. Schneer?
PATIENT: Oh, that's a tricky one. My mother… she lived a long life, thankfully. But I don't recall her havin' much trouble with her hearin', not that I remember. My father, he passed away when I was young. And I never had any siblings, just me. So, not much family to talk about, really. Mostly just quiet on that front. It’s probably best that way, honestly. Less worryin', you see.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Schneer. Now, a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no! Never touched a cigarette in my life. My mother always said they were terrible for you. And she was right, of course. Always was a sensible woman, my mother. I always preferred a good cup of tea, myself. That’s my vice, I suppose, if you can call it that. A nice, strong brew.
DOCTOR: Do you drink alcohol, Mr. Schneer?
PATIENT: Oh, very little. Just a small glass of sherry on special occasions. Christmas, you know. Or maybe a birthday. Nothing regular. Never been much of a drinker, truthfully. Always preferred a quiet evening at home, with a good book. Not much for parties, you see. Too loud.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, before we proceed with an examination, are you allergic to any medications, foods, or other substances?
PATIENT: Oh, land sakes. That's a good question. Let me think... Not that I'm aware of. I've always been pretty lucky, I suppose. Never had a bad reaction to anything. Just the usual little sniffles when the weather turns cold. But nothing serious. No, I don't think I have any allergies. Maybe a bit sensitive to dust, but that's about it.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Schneer. Now, I'd like to conduct a brief physical examination of your ears to get a better understanding of what might be going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, Doctor. That sounds fine. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. Just let me know if anything hurts, alright? I’m a bit of a worrier, you see. But I’m ready when you are. Do you need me to do anything special? Lie down, maybe?
DOCTOR: No, you can remain seated, Mr. Schneer. Just try to relax. I'm going to gently insert this instrument into each ear to visualize your eardrum. It may feel a little cool, but it shouldn't be painful. Now, let’s start with your right ear. Hmm… There appears to be a significant amount of cerumen – earwax – obstructing the canal. It’s impacting the eardrum. And the left ear shows similar blockage. The eardrums themselves appear intact, but visualization is limited due to the wax buildup. This is likely contributing to your hearing difficulties. Now, I’m going to perform a quick hearing screening with a tuning fork. Close your eyes, please.
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Earwax, you say? Well, that makes sense, I suppose. Always was a bit of a messy one, I reckon. I don’t bother with cotton swabs or anything, never liked stickin’ things in my ears. Close my eyes, alright. Just tell me what to do, Doctor. I’m ready when you are. Let me know if that little thing makes a loud noise!
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Schneer. I’m going to place this tuning fork on the bone behind your ear. Please tell me when you can no longer hear the sound. And now, I'm going to hold it near your ear canal. Let me know if you hear a difference. Hmm… There is a noticeable reduction in bone conduction hearing, and minimal air conduction hearing. This further suggests cerumen impaction as the primary cause of your hearing loss. Okay, Mr. Schneer. You can open your eyes now. Based on my examination, your hearing loss is most likely due to a buildup of earwax in both ears. This is quite common. The good news is, it's easily treatable.
PATIENT: Oh, my. Sounds a bit complicated, Doctor. But you think it’s treatable, you say? That's a relief. I was worried it was somethin’ serious. So, what do we do about this earwax? Do you have to… dig it out? I don't like the sound of diggin'! I’m a bit sensitive, you see. What are my options? Is there somethin' I can take?
DOCTOR: No, Mr. Schneer, we won't be "digging" anything out. There are several ways to remove the earwax safely. The most common method is irrigation – gently flushing the ear canal with warm water. I can perform this in the office. Alternatively, there are over-the-counter earwax softening drops you can use at home for a few days beforehand to loosen the wax, and then I can irrigate. I generally recommend the drops first, for comfort. However, given your age and medical history, and to avoid any potential complications, I would prefer to perform the irrigation myself in the office, under direct supervision. Would that be acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Oh, that sounds much better, Doctor. No diggin’, you say? And you’ll do it yourself? Yes, that would be wonderful. I trust your judgment, of course. It’s probably best to leave it to the professionals, isn’t it? I don't want to mess anything up. When can we do this, then? Do I need to bring anything with me? And how long will it take? I’ve got my afternoon tea to think about!
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Schneer. I have you scheduled for an ear irrigation procedure tomorrow at 10:00 AM. It shouldn't take more than 20-30 minutes. You don’t need to bring anything with you, just come as you are. The procedure itself is generally painless, although you may experience some mild discomfort or a feeling of fullness in your ears. I will explain the process thoroughly before we begin. Afterwards, there may be some temporary ringing or slight hearing changes, but this is usually short-lived. I will also provide you with instructions on how to care for your ears at home. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Oh, that sounds perfect, Doctor. 10:00 AM tomorrow it is. No, I don’t think I have any other questions. You’ve explained everything so clearly. Just a little worried about that ringin’, but you said it’s usually short-lived, so that’s good. Thank you so much for takin’ the time to see me. I feel much better now, knowin’ what’s goin’ on. I appreciate your patience with an old man like me. I do tend to ramble on, don't I?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Schneer. It was my pleasure. And don’t worry about rambling – I’m accustomed to it. We’ll get those ears cleared out tomorrow, and hopefully, you’ll be enjoying your afternoon tea with much better hearing. If you experience any concerning symptoms after the procedure, such as severe pain, bleeding, or persistent dizziness, please contact the office immediately. Otherwise, I’ll see you tomorrow at 10:00 AM. Have a good afternoon, Mr. Schneer.
PATIENT: Oh, wonderful! Thank you again, Doctor. I will. You have a good afternoon too, and thank you for everything.
