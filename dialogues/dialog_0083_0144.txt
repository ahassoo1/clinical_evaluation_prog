DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Calvery. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Alanes. It’s nice to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello dear. Well, honestly? Just… curiosity, I suppose. My friend, Eunice, she comes here, raves about you. Said I should get myself checked out, even though I feel perfectly fine. Honestly, doctors these days… always poking and prodding. But Eunice was insistent. So here I am. It's… a nice little place you have here. Not too fancy.
DOCTOR: That’s very kind of you to say, Ms. Calvery. It’s wonderful Eunice recommended our clinic, and I appreciate you coming in, even if it’s just for a general check-up. It’s always good to be proactive about your health. And you are right, we focus on care rather than extravagance here. To start, can you tell me a little bit about how you’ve been feeling generally?
PATIENT: Generally? Well… old. I feel old, if that’s what you mean. My knees ache when it rains, and I forget where I put my glasses – which is ironic, isn’t it? But other than that, I get by. I still do my own cooking, and I manage the garden. Though it’s getting harder each year, of course. Everything’s harder each year. I suppose that's just…life. Is that what you want to know?
DOCTOR: That's very helpful, Ms. Calvery. It’s good you’re still active and managing well. The aches and pains, and some memory lapses are common as we get older, but we want to make sure everything is alright. Just to get a more complete picture, could you tell me about any other symptoms you've been experiencing?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Oh, goodness. What aren’t symptoms at my age? I get tired easily, but who doesn’t? My stomach… well, it rumbles. I eat a lot of kimchi, so that could be it. Sometimes I feel a little… dizzy, but only when I stand up too fast. My daughter keeps telling me to drink more water. Honestly, it’s all very…normal, isn’t it? I don't go to the doctor for every little thing. Back in my day, you only went when something was really wrong.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Calvery. It’s good to know what you’ve been experiencing, even the things that seem minor. And you’re right, it’s important not to overreact to every little discomfort. We’ll take a thorough look and see if anything needs further attention. Just to be certain, have you experienced any chest pain, shortness of breath, or any changes in your vision?
PATIENT: Chest pain? Oh, no, dear. Not at all. My heart’s fine, I think. It’s been beating for sixty-four years, hasn’t it? Shortness of breath… maybe when I climb the stairs, but that’s just because they’re so many stairs! And my vision… it's not what it used to be, naturally. That's why I have these glasses. Everything gets blurry if I take them off. Is that what you’re asking? Honestly, all these questions… are you sure you need to know all this? It feels like you’re looking for something that isn't there.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. Calvery. I apologize if I’m asking a lot of questions; it’s simply my way of making sure I have a complete picture of your health. It’s important to rule out any potential issues, even if they seem unlikely. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Do you have any chronic conditions, like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart disease?
PATIENT: Oh, land sakes. Medical history… My husband, bless his soul, he had high blood pressure. And my mother, she had something with her sugar. Diabetes, I think? I don't recall exactly. As for me… The doctor told me years ago my cholesterol was a little high, so I tried to eat less fried chicken for a while. But Eunice makes such a good fried chicken… it's hard to resist! I don’t really have any conditions, not that I know of. I've always been pretty healthy, all things considered. Just old, like I said. Is that enough history for you? Honestly, I'm starting to feel like a specimen.
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful, Ms. Calvery. And I apologize again if I'm making you feel like a specimen – that’s certainly not my intention. Knowing your family history is very important. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Surgeries... Oh, let me see. When I was a little girl, I had my tonsils out. That was a long time ago. And… I think I had my appendix out too, but I can’t remember exactly. It was all very blurry. And when my husband passed, I was in the hospital for a few days. But that wasn’t a surgery, just… sad. Nothing major, really. A few little things here and there. It’s all so long ago, it’s hard to remember the details. Honestly, I don’t think any of it is important. I just want to make sure I'm still fit enough to tend to my garden. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: No, Ms. Calvery, that’s not too much to ask at all. It’s perfectly understandable that it’s hard to recall details from so long ago. Knowing about the tonsillectomy and possible appendectomy is helpful. Now, let’s talk about medications. Are you currently taking any prescription or over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications... Oh, dear. Here we go. Let’s see… I take something for my water retention, my daughter makes me. And something for my stomach, after I eat kimchi. And… Oh, yes! Something for my knees, when it rains. And... Oh, this one... I don’t even remember what this is for! My daughter fills these every month. She thinks I need all sorts of things. Honestly, I probably take too much. It's all a bit of a blur. I don’t even know what half of these are supposed to do.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Calvery. It's good you brought these in. It can be difficult to keep track of everything, especially with multiple medications. I’m going to write down each of these so we can go through them together. Do you know what each of these is for?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. You expect me to know? My daughter handles all of that. She tells me what to take, when to take it, and I just… do it. I think the white one is for my water retention. Makes me go to the bathroom a lot, that one. And the little pink one is for my stomach, I think. After the kimchi, of course. The others… I haven’t the slightest idea. Honestly, I just swallow them with a glass of water and hope for the best. Is it important? Is something wrong? I told you, I feel perfectly fine. My daughter just worries too much.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly alright, Ms. Calvery. It’s very common for patients to be unsure about their medications, especially when they have several. And no, nothing is necessarily wrong. It’s just important for me to have a complete list, so I can make sure everything is safe and appropriate for you. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or environmental factors?
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmm… not that I know of. I eat everything. My mother always said a good appetite was a sign of good health. I used to love shellfish, but… Oh, now that I think about it, I did get a rash once, after eating some shrimp. It was a long time ago, though. Maybe it was just something else I ate. And dust… Dust makes me sneeze, of course. Everyone sneezes when there’s dust! But that’s not really an allergy, is it? I wouldn’t say I have any serious allergies. Just a little bit of sneezing, and maybe a rash now and then. Honestly, I’m not a delicate flower.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Calvery. It’s good to know about the possible reaction to the shrimp, and we’ll make a note of that. And dust sensitivity is quite common. Now, before we move on to a physical examination, I’d like to ask a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: Smoke? Heavens, no! My husband smoked, bless his soul, but I always told him it was a terrible habit. Smelled awful, too. I used to chase him around the house with a rolled-up newspaper, trying to get him to stop. Never touched a cigarette in my life. Not a single puff! I always said it was a waste of good money, and bad for your health. No, I've never smoked, and I can't stand the smell of it. It's just dreadful. Honestly, I'm surprised anyone ever starts. It's just silly.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful, Ms. Calvery. And good for you for encouraging your husband to quit. Now, how about alcohol?
PATIENT: Alcohol? Oh, a little. I like a glass of wine with dinner sometimes. Especially with a nice piece of fish. Or a good steak. My daughter buys me a nice Pinot Grigio. She knows I like it. But not every day! Just… occasionally. Maybe a glass on the weekends, if I'm feeling festive. Or with company. It’s nice to relax with a little wine. But I don’t drink to excess. Never have. I'm not one of those people. Just a little sip now and then. It’s good for the heart, isn’t it? My mother always said a little bit of wine was good for the circulation. But not too much, of course. That would be silly.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Calvery. A glass of wine occasionally is perfectly reasonable. Now, to get a better understanding of your overall health, I’d like to perform a quick physical examination, if that’s alright with you. This will involve listening to your heart and lungs, checking your blood pressure, and a few other simple tests. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Oh, a physical examination. Well, I suppose so. It's just… I don't like being poked and prodded. My daughter always insists I get checked out, but honestly, I feel perfectly fine. But if you insist, dear, go ahead. Just be gentle, alright? And don't take too long. I have to get home to tend to my garden. The tomatoes are ripening, and they need picking. Just… be quick about it. And try not to make a fuss. It's all very… unsettling, you know? Being examined like a specimen.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Calvery. I’ll be as gentle and quick as possible. We’ll just do a few simple checks to get a baseline of your health. I’ll explain everything as I go. First, let's check your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is 148/82. That's a little elevated, but not dramatically so. We can monitor that over time. Now, let's listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Do you feel any shortness of breath or chest pain when I press here?
PATIENT: Oh, is that high? My daughter always said my blood pressure was a little high. She worries too much. And pressing here? Well, it's a little… uncomfortable. But not painful, exactly. Just… sensitive. I have a delicate chest, you know? And I've been gardening all morning, lifting heavy pots of tomatoes. Maybe that's why it's sensitive? It's probably just the gardening. Honestly, I don't think there's anything wrong. I feel perfectly fine. Just a little tired, maybe. But that's just old age, isn't it?
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly understandable, Ms. Calvery. It’s good you’re active, but lifting heavy pots can certainly cause some tenderness. We'll keep that in mind. Now, I’d like to check your reflexes. Your reflexes are a little diminished, which is common as we get older. Now, let's take a look at your ears and throat. Your ears look clear. Now, open wide and say “Ah.” Your throat looks clear as well. Everything looks good so far. Now, let's do a quick check of your hands and feet. Are you experiencing any pain or numbness in your hands or feet?
PATIENT: Oh, these little tests are… unsettling. Diminished? What does that mean? Am I losing my reflexes? Honestly, I feel like a specimen in a laboratory. And my hands and feet… Well, sometimes my hands get a little cold. Especially in the winter. And my feet… My feet are just old. They ache a little, after a long day of gardening. But nothing serious. Just old age, isn't it? I’ve been on my feet all morning, tending to my tomatoes. That’s probably why they ache. Honestly, I don’t think there's anything wrong. I feel perfectly fine. Just a little tired, maybe. It's all very… exhausting, you know? Being poked and prodded like this.
DOCTOR: Diminished reflexes just mean they’re a little slower than they used to be, Ms. Calvery. It’s a very common part of aging, and it doesn't necessarily mean anything is wrong. And cold hands and aching feet are also common, especially with activity and as we get older. Okay, Ms. Calvery, I’m finished with the physical examination. Everything seems generally okay, but I’d like to order a few blood tests just to get a more complete picture of your health. These tests will check your cholesterol, blood sugar, kidney function, and thyroid levels. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, blood tests? More poking and prodding? Honestly, I feel like a pin cushion. But… I suppose if you insist, dear. My daughter would want me to get them done, anyway. She worries too much. But… Will it hurt? Will it take long? I have to get home to tend to my tomatoes. They need picking, and they won't pick themselves, you know. Just… be quick about it. And try not to make a fuss. It's all very… unsettling, you know? Being poked and prodded like this. And can I at least have a glass of water afterwards? It’s very dehydrating, all this worrying.
DOCTOR: It will only be a small amount of blood, Ms. Calvery, and it will be over very quickly. We’ll have a phlebotomist come in and take the sample. It shouldn’t take more than 10-15 minutes, and we’ll definitely have a glass of water for you afterwards. It’s perfectly normal to feel a little dehydrated, especially after being worried. I’m ordering a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, a lipid panel, and a thyroid stimulating hormone test. Once the results are back, we can discuss them in detail and come up with a plan to keep you healthy. In the meantime, I recommend continuing to eat a healthy diet, staying active, and drinking plenty of water. And don’t worry too much about the tomatoes – they’ll be fine for a few more hours. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Oh, all those… words. Honestly, I don't understand half of them. But… Is everything alright? Am I… sick? My daughter always worries about my cholesterol. And my thyroid… what even is a thyroid? Is it serious? Honestly, I feel perfectly fine. Just a little tired, maybe. But I don’t want to be sick. I have to tend to my tomatoes. I suppose if you say everything is alright, I’ll believe you. But honestly, I don't like being poked and prodded like this. It's all very… unsettling, you know? And will these tests tell me if I need more fertilizer for my tomatoes? That’s all I really care about.
DOCTOR: Ms. Calvery, I understand your concerns, and I want to assure you that everything seems alright. These tests are just a precaution to get a more complete picture of your health. They will help us rule out any potential issues and make sure you stay healthy for years to come. Your cholesterol and thyroid are both important for your overall health, but right now, there’s no reason to worry. We’re just checking to make sure everything is functioning properly. And unfortunately, these tests won’t tell us anything about your tomato fertilizer. But I’m sure Eunice can give you some good advice on that! I’ll let you know as soon as the results are back, usually within a few days. In the meantime, please continue to eat a healthy diet, stay active, and drink plenty of water. Do you have any other questions or concerns that I can address?
PATIENT: Oh, well, that's… good to know. Eunice does know a lot about gardening. She's always bragging about her tomatoes. But honestly, I don't think I have any other questions. I just want to get home to tend to my tomatoes. They need picking, and they won't pick themselves, you know. So, I suppose if you're finished with me, I'll go. Thank you for… poking and prodding me. It's all very… unsettling, you know? But I suppose it's good to know everything seems alright. And can I at least have that glass of water now? It's very dehydrating, all this worrying.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Calvery. Here, let me get you that glass of water. And yes, I completely understand your desire to get home to your tomatoes. They’re lucky to have such a dedicated gardener! We’ll be in touch as soon as the results are back. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. Thank you for coming in today, Ms. Calvery. And enjoy your tomatoes!
