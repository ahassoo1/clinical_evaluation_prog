DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Julie Burdette. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Lahn. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you as well, Doctor. Honestly, I wish I didn't have to be here. It's…rather inconvenient, all of this. Something about my vision and hearing, apparently. I don't recall the specifics, to be frank. It just came on suddenly, and my assistant insisted I see someone. It's probably nothing, really.
DOCTOR: I understand it’s frustrating to have something come on suddenly, especially when you’re not sure what’s going on. And it’s good your assistant encouraged you to get it checked out. We’ll figure it out together. So, you said something about your vision and hearing coming on suddenly?
PATIENT: Yes, that's right. Suddenly. It's…difficult to explain. Things just seemed…dimmer, and quieter. Not completely gone, mind you, just…less. It was a few days ago, I believe. Honestly, my schedule is quite demanding, and I don't always have time to focus on personal ailments. It’s probably just stress, if you ask me. I deal with children all day. You can imagine the noise.
DOCTOR: I can certainly imagine the noise. Stress can definitely contribute to changes in vision and hearing, but it’s good we’re checking it out to rule out anything else. When you say “dimmer,” can you describe that a bit more?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Well, it’s not like…a complete blackout, Doctor. It’s more like…looking through a slightly dirty window, perhaps? Everything is…muted. And the sounds…they’re just…fainter. I had trouble hearing my assistant this morning, which is rather unusual. She’s always so…projected. I don't know. It’s just…not as sharp as it usually is. Honestly, it's all rather bothersome and taking up valuable time.
DOCTOR: Okay, “muted” and “not as sharp” are helpful. And having trouble hearing your assistant is a good piece of information. Have you noticed any ringing in your ears, dizziness, or any pain associated with either your vision or hearing?
PATIENT: Ringing? No, I don't believe so. Dizziness…well, sometimes I feel a little lightheaded, but that’s usually just from being on my feet for too long in the operating room. It's hardly…significant. And pain? Absolutely not. I'm a surgeon, Doctor, I know pain. This is just…a slight inconvenience. Honestly, I’m rather busy, and I’m not sure how long we’ll be going over this. Perhaps it’s just a temporary thing?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns about your time, Ms. Burdette, and I’ll do my best to be efficient. It’s good to know you haven’t experienced any pain. Just to get a full picture, could you tell me a little bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Medical history... Honestly, I barely have time to live my life, let alone document it. I've had the usual things, I suppose. Flu shots, a broken wrist when I was a child... Divorced, if that counts as a medical condition. I'm generally quite healthy, very active, and I maintain a strict diet. I don't recall any major illnesses or surgeries beyond the routine things. I have private insurance, if that's what you’re asking. I don’t typically need to see doctors.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear you’re generally healthy and active. No major surgeries or illnesses is helpful to know. And I appreciate you letting me know about the insurance. Do you have any family history of hearing loss or vision problems?
PATIENT: Oh, family history… Honestly, I haven’t kept up with that sort of thing. My mother had…something. I believe it was cataracts, perhaps? And my father…he was a bit hard of hearing in his later years, but he worked on a farm, so one can imagine the exposure to loud noises. It wasn't a particularly…refined family, if you understand what I mean. We weren’t ones for keeping meticulous records. I'm quite certain there wasn't anything significant. I’ve always been the healthy one.
DOCTOR: Okay, cataracts in your mother and some hearing loss in your father – that’s helpful to know. Now, are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… Just a multivitamin, I suppose. And sometimes I take something for my…joints. It’s nothing regular, just when they bother me. I can’t recall the name, honestly. Something my physical therapist recommended. It’s a small, white pill. I rarely take anything beyond that. I believe in maintaining a healthy lifestyle, so I try to avoid medications whenever possible. Honestly, I find most of them unnecessary. Is that what you wanted to know? Perhaps we can expedite this process? I have a rather important meeting this afternoon.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s very helpful. I understand your time is valuable, Ms. Burdette, and I’ll try to be as efficient as possible. I think it would be helpful to do a quick physical exam to get a better understanding of what’s going on. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, must we? Honestly, I’m rather particular about personal space. But…I suppose if it’s absolutely necessary. Just please be quick about it. And I would prefer if you explained everything as you go along. I dislike surprises. Do you have a clean examination room? I trust your standards are…acceptable? I simply can’t be exposed to germs, you understand. My patients depend on me.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. We maintain very strict hygiene standards here, Ms. Burdette. The examination room is thoroughly cleaned after each patient. And I will certainly explain everything as I go along, and move as quickly as possible. If you’ll have a seat, we’ll start with a basic vision test. I’ll just have you look at the eye chart over there.
PATIENT: Very well. But do be gentle. I have important hands, you know. Get on with it, then. I haven’t got all day. I do hope this doesn't take long.
DOCTOR: Certainly. Now, please cover your left eye with your hand, and read the smallest line you can see on this chart. Don’t strain yourself. …Okay, good. Now, cover your right eye and read this chart. …Alright. It appears you have some mild vision reduction in your left eye, roughly 20/30. Your right eye is 20/20. Not significant, but worth noting. Now, let's check your peripheral vision. I’m going to have you look straight ahead, and I'll hold up fingers in your peripheral vision. Tell me when you can see them.
PATIENT: Oh, this is rather tedious. 20/30? That is rather inconvenient. I need perfect vision for my work, you know. I…I think I see something on the left. It's blurry, though. Is that what you wanted? Honestly, I don't have time for games. My schedule is quite demanding, you understand. I have patients waiting for me. This is all very…disruptive. And frankly, the lighting in here is unflattering.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Burdette. We’re just gathering information to get a clearer picture. It's good that you're aware of the slight reduction. Now, I’m going to use an otoscope to look in your ears. This won’t be uncomfortable, just a quick look to see if there’s any blockage or inflammation. Just relax and stay still. …Okay. Your ear canals appear clear, and your eardrums look normal. No signs of infection or blockage. Now, I’m going to do a quick hearing test with a tuning fork. This will help us assess your ability to hear different frequencies.
PATIENT: Oh, must you poke around in there? Honestly, I find that rather…invasive. Normal, you say? That's…something, I suppose. But I told you I was having trouble hearing! Don’t tell me everything is normal when I clearly am experiencing a problem. Honestly, I’m starting to doubt your competence. A tuning fork? Is that what they still use these days? It seems rather…primitive. Get on with it, then. But be careful! I have sensitive ears. And do hurry, please. My patients are waiting.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Burdette, and I apologize if the examination is causing any discomfort. We are just trying to rule out any obvious causes for your hearing loss. …Okay. Your hearing appears slightly diminished in both ears, especially at higher frequencies. Not drastic, but noticeable. It sounds like you have some mild sensorineural hearing loss, which is common with age. Based on my examination, it appears you have mild vision reduction in your left eye, and mild sensorineural hearing loss in both ears. It’s possible these are unrelated, or could be due to age-related changes. I’d like to discuss some further testing options to get a more definitive diagnosis. Would you be open to an audiogram to assess your hearing more thoroughly, and potentially a referral to an ophthalmologist to evaluate your vision?
PATIENT: Oh, so now you’re telling me I’m old? Honestly, that’s rather rude. I’m perfectly capable, thank you very much. And “age-related changes”? I’ve always had excellent hearing and vision. An audiogram and an ophthalmologist? More tests? More appointments? Honestly, this is becoming quite ridiculous. I don’t have time for all of this. No. Absolutely not. I’m a surgeon, Doctor, not a…a patient. I think I’ve heard enough. I’m perfectly fine. It’s probably just stress. I'll take some time off. That’s all. I'm leaving now. I expect a detailed report of this…inconclusive examination. And please, don't bother contacting me unless it's absolutely necessary. .
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Burdette. I understand your frustration and respect your decision. I will prepare a detailed report of my findings and have it sent to you. However, I do want to reiterate that mild hearing and vision changes can significantly impact your quality of life, and early detection is key to managing any potential underlying causes. If your symptoms worsen, or you experience any new concerns, please don’t hesitate to seek medical attention. Thank you for your time. Have a good day, and I wish you all the best.
