DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Aluia. I’m Dr. Eaddy. It says here you’re seventy-one years of age. Now, to what do we owe the pleasure of your visit today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Yes, seventy-one, almost seventy-two, actually. It's these bumps on my legs. My shins, you know? They're red and kinda sore. Been bothering me for a little while now.
DOCTOR: "A little while." Could you be a bit more specific, Mr. Aluia?
PATIENT: Hmm... let me think. Maybe... three, four months now? They started small, I didn't pay much attention at first. Thought they were just bruises, maybe from work. But they haven't gone away, and they're getting... well, more noticeable. And a little bit uncomfortable when I walk.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what sort of work do you do, Mr. Aluia?
PATIENT: I move things around, mostly. Freight, stock... you know, loading and unloading. Down at the warehouse. It's pretty physical work, always on my feet. Been doing it a long time, though. Keeps me young, I guess! But maybe it's too much now...
DOCTOR: Perhaps. We’ll see. Now, are these bumps… itchy?
PATIENT: No, not really itchy. Sore, mostly. Like a bruise that doesn't go away. And sometimes they feel warm to the touch, if that makes sense. Not all of them, but some do. I haven't noticed anything else, though. No fever or anything like that.
DOCTOR: Alright. I'd like to take a look. If you wouldn't mind, please sit up on the examination table for me. And if you could loosen your trousers a bit, that would be helpful.
PATIENT: Okay, sure. No problem, Doctor. Been to the doctor enough times to know the drill! Is this good? Should I pull them up higher or...?
DOCTOR: That’s quite alright, Mr. Aluia. Let's have a look then. Hmm. Yes, I see what you mean. There's some erythema, and... yes, a bit of induration. Are you experiencing any pain with palpation here?
PATIENT: Uh, yeah, a little bit. Not terrible, but... Right there is a bit tender. And maybe... over here too. It's not a sharp pain, more of a dull ache, you know? Like a bad bruise.
DOCTOR: And have you noticed any changes in the skin around these areas?
PATIENT: Changes...? Not really. It looks the same to me. Maybe a little bit dry? My skin always gets dry in the summer, especially. I put lotion on, but it doesn't seem to help much. Is that what you're asking about? I'm not very good at noticing these things... My wife usually tells me when something's wrong with my skin.
DOCTOR: Very well. I’m going to check your pulses in your feet. Please let me know if you feel any discomfort.
PATIENT: Okay, no problem. I think I feel it... a little thumping? Is that right? It doesn't hurt or anything. Just... feeling the pulse, I guess.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s correct. Adequate pulses, thankfully. Now, have you had any recent injuries to your legs?
PATIENT: No, not really. Like I said, I work at the warehouse. I bump my shins sometimes, but nothing major. Just little knocks, you know? Nothing that would cause something like this, I don't think. I haven't fallen or anything. My wife would have a fit if I fell! She worries about me.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications, Mr. Aluia?
PATIENT: Just some vitamins, Doctor. Multivitamins, mostly. And sometimes I take something for my knees, when they bother me. It's over-the-counter stuff, nothing special. Oh, and I take something for my blood pressure, but it's a low dose. It's been pretty stable lately, thankfully. Does that count?
DOCTOR: Yes, that counts. And what is the name of the medication for your blood pressure, Mr. Aluia?
PATIENT: Hmm... let me think... It's... Lisinopril. Yes, Lisinopril. That's it. Small dose, like the doctor told me. It's been helping keep things steady. Is that enough information? I'm not very good at remembering names, you know...
DOCTOR: Adequate. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications or other substances?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. My wife always asks me that when I go to the doctor, and I always tell her no. I haven't had any bad reactions to anything, thankfully. I eat all sorts of things, and I haven't broken out in a rash or anything like that. I'm pretty lucky, I guess!
DOCTOR: Alright. Based on my examination, and your medical history, it appears you may be experiencing stasis dermatitis. It is likely related to venous insufficiency, given your age and occupation. This means the blood isn't flowing back up your legs efficiently, causing fluid to build up and leading to inflammation and skin irritation. We will need to run some tests to confirm, of course.
PATIENT: Stasis... what-now? Venous... insufficiency? Doctor, I'm sorry, I don't understand. Is that... bad? And what kind of tests? I just thought it was some bumps on my legs from work! Are you saying I need to stop working?
DOCTOR: No, Mr. Aluia, I am not saying you need to stop working immediately. However, prolonged standing can exacerbate the condition. As for the tests, we will need to perform a duplex ultrasound to assess the blood flow in your legs. It's a non-invasive imaging study. We'll also need some bloodwork to rule out other possible causes. Think of it as simply gathering more information. This will help us determine the best course of treatment. We can discuss options such as compression stockings and topical corticosteroids once we have the results. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Uh... compression stockings? Like, really tight socks? And bloodwork... that means needles, right? I don't like needles. Doctor, is this something serious? Will I need surgery? My wife will be so worried... I just want to get back to work, you know? I can't afford to be off my feet for too long.
DOCTOR: Mr. Aluia, please try to remain calm. It’s unlikely you will require surgery at this stage. The bloodwork is standard procedure to eliminate other possibilities. I understand your concerns, but it's important to get a proper diagnosis before jumping to conclusions. I'll order the tests now, and we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results in a week. We'll take it one step at a time. Now, is there anything else I can address for you today?
