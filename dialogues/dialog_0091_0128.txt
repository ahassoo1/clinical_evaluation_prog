DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Voner. My name is Dr. Talen Delacour. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Please, call me Lilliana. Um… well, my joints. They’re just… stiff. Especially in the mornings. It’s… not so good. I don't really know what else to tell you. It's just been happening more lately, I think.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Lilliana. It’s good to meet you as well. Stiffness in the joints, particularly in the mornings… I understand. To help me get a better understanding of what’s going on, could you tell me a little more about this stiffness?
PATIENT: Hmm. More about it… Well, it's mostly my hands and knees, I think. And my back a little. It feels… like when you've been sitting too long, but it doesn't really go away when I move. It takes a long time to loosen up. I used to just… push through it, but it’s harder now. I don’t know if that makes sense. Do you… need me to be more specific? I’m not good at explaining things, I’m afraid.
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense, Lilliana. You’re doing perfectly fine. It’s helpful to know it’s primarily in your hands, knees, and back, and that movement doesn’t provide immediate relief. That is very relevant information. To clarify, could you tell me approximately how long this has been going on – when did you first notice the stiffness?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s… a hard question. It’s been… a while. Years, I think. Not all the time, though. It comes and goes. But… maybe the last few years it's been more consistent? It’s hard to say exactly. My memory isn’t what it used to be. My husband… he always remembered things for me. I’m sorry, I'm not being very helpful, am I?
DOCTOR: You're being very helpful, Lilliana. It’s perfectly alright that you’re unsure of the exact timeframe. Many patients find it difficult to pinpoint when symptoms began. Knowing it's been present for years, with increasing consistency recently, is a good starting point. To get a better picture, when these symptoms are at their worst, how would you rate the pain on a scale of zero to ten, with zero being no pain and ten being the worst pain imaginable?
PATIENT: Oh, a scale… Hmm. Let me think. When it’s bad… it’s not like a sharp pain, it’s more of an ache. And it makes it hard to… do things. Maybe a… six? On a good day, maybe a three or four. But some mornings, getting out of bed… definitely a six. Sometimes even a seven. It’s not the worst pain, but it’s… bothersome. It just makes everything harder. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Lilliana. A six to seven on a bad day, and a three to four on a good day, with an aching sensation… I appreciate you quantifying that for me. Now, are there any other symptoms that accompany this stiffness and aching?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… Well, sometimes my hands feel a little swollen, I think. Not always, but when they’re really stiff. And… I get tired easily. Much more easily than I used to. I just put that down to getting older, mostly. And… sometimes I feel a little… warm, but I don't know if that's related. It could just be the weather. I really don’t know. I get confused easily too, but that’s… well, that’s just me, I suppose.
DOCTOR: I understand, Lilliana. The swelling in your hands, increased fatigue, and occasional feeling of warmth are all potentially relevant. And it’s good you mentioned the confusion, though we will explore that further later. To get a broader understanding, have you noticed any stiffness or pain in other joints, like your elbows, shoulders, or hips?
PATIENT: Oh… my elbows, sometimes. Not as bad as my hands and knees, though. And… my shoulders ache a little, if I reach up too high. But I just thought I was… getting old. Hips… no, not really my hips. I think. Maybe a little twinge sometimes, but nothing I’ve really paid attention to. I mostly notice it in my hands and knees. I do a lot of cooking, you see, and that makes my hands hurt. Is that… important?
DOCTOR: Yes, that is important, Lilliana. The fact that the symptoms are primarily in your hands and knees, with some involvement in your elbows and shoulders, and that cooking exacerbates the hand pain, is helpful information. Now, thinking about your overall health, do you have any other medical conditions that you've been diagnosed with?
PATIENT: Oh goodness. Let me think... Well, the doctor told me years ago I had… high blood pressure, I think. But I don't take any medicine for it. He said to watch my salt intake. And… I used to have a bad back, years and years ago, but it healed. Mostly. That's about it, I think. Nothing else that I can remember. I get a little… breathless sometimes, but I just put that down to getting older too. I don’t want to bother you with all this, I’m probably just rambling.
DOCTOR: You are not rambling at all, Lilliana. This is all very important information. High blood pressure, a history of back problems, and occasional breathlessness are all relevant. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for any reason?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think… No, I don’t think so. Not that I can remember. I had my tonsils out when I was a little girl, but that was… a long time ago. And… my husband, he had a hip replacement a few years before he passed away. But that was him, not me. No, I haven't had any surgeries or been in the hospital. Not that I remember, anyway. My memory isn’t very good, you see. Is that a problem?
DOCTOR: No, that is not a problem, Lilliana. It’s helpful to know you’ve not had any surgeries or hospitalizations. Now, could you tell me about your family history?
PATIENT: Oh, family history… Hmm. My mother had… arthritis, I think. In her hands. She had a lot of trouble with them. And my father… he had heart problems. He passed away when he was quite young. I don’t know much about their… specifics, I’m afraid. They didn’t really talk about things like that much. And my husband… his mother had something with her bones, but I can’t remember what it was. I’m not very good with these things, I’m afraid. Does that help?
DOCTOR: It does help, Lilliana. A family history of arthritis and heart problems is relevant. Now, could you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle… Oh dear. Well, I live alone now, since my husband passed. I mostly keep to myself. I do a lot of cooking, like I said. And I like to read. I don’t really… go out much anymore. I used to be very active, but… I don’t have much energy these days. I don’t smoke, and I don’t drink. I try to eat healthy, but… sometimes it’s hard. I mostly just try to take things easy. Is that… what you wanted to know?
DOCTOR: Yes, that is very helpful, Lilliana. It sounds like you lead a relatively quiet life, and maintain a healthy lifestyle overall. Finally, are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, I don’t take anything. Not even vitamins. I used to take something for my blood pressure, but the doctor told me to stop years ago. He said to just watch my salt. So, no, nothing at all. I don't really believe in taking a lot of medicine. Is that… silly? I just think it's better to try and get by on your own. I'm afraid I don't have much insurance either, so it's hard to afford things like that.
DOCTOR: No, that is not silly at all, Lilliana. Many people prefer to manage their health without medication when possible. And I understand your concerns about cost, especially with limited insurance. Okay, Lilliana, thank you for providing me with all of this information. It gives me a much clearer picture of what's been going on. It sounds like you've been dealing with joint stiffness and pain for a long time, which is impacting your daily life. Based on what you’ve told me, the symptoms, your family history, and the physical exam I’m about to perform, we need to explore some possibilities. I am leaning towards something like osteoarthritis, but we need to rule out other causes as well. Now, if you don’t mind, I’m going to do a quick physical exam of your joints to assess the range of motion, tenderness, and any signs of swelling. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh… osteoarthritis? Is that… bad? I don’t really understand all these medical terms. And… a physical exam? That sounds… well, I suppose it’s alright. As long as it doesn’t hurt too much. I’m a little worried it might be something serious, but… I suppose you’ll tell me if it is. Just… be gentle, please. My hands are very sensitive, especially in the mornings. And I don’t want to bother you with all my aches and pains.
DOCTOR: It's perfectly alright to be worried, Lilliana. It's my job to alleviate those concerns. Osteoarthritis is a common condition, especially as we get older. It involves the breakdown of cartilage in the joints, leading to pain and stiffness. It's usually not immediately serious, but it can be quite debilitating if left unmanaged. I will be very gentle, I assure you. We'll take things slowly, and you can tell me if anything is uncomfortable. I'll start by examining your hands, then move to your knees and other joints. I'll be looking for swelling, tenderness, and range of motion. I’ll be explaining what I’m doing as I go along, and will be recording my findings as we go. Alright, if you could please sit here on the examination table, we'll start with your hands. Could you extend your arms out in front of you, palms up?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Palms up… like this? Be gentle, please. I worry about falling, my balance isn’t what it used to be. And... my hands are a little cold today, if that makes a difference. I try to keep them warm, but... it's hard. I don't know if you need me to hold anything or… just tell me what to do. I'm a little confused, you see.
DOCTOR: Yes, exactly like that, Lilliana. Thank you. And don’t worry, I will be very gentle. I’ll support your arms, so you don’t have to worry about falling. And it’s helpful to know your hands are cold; that can sometimes affect the exam. Okay, I'm just going to gently feel around each of your joints. This will help me assess for any tenderness or swelling. Tell me if anything feels particularly painful. Hmm. I’m noticing some slight swelling around the knuckles of your hands, particularly on this side. And there is some tenderness when I apply pressure here. On a scale of zero to ten, with zero being no pain and ten being the worst pain imaginable, how would you rate that tenderness?
PATIENT: Oh, that… that’s a little sore. Not awful, but… definitely uncomfortable. Hmm… maybe a four? On a good day it's not there at all, but today… maybe a four. It's… a dull ache, more than a sharp pain. And it kind of radiates up my arm a little. I don't know if that makes sense. It’s the same on this hand too, but maybe a little less. I don’t know if I’m explaining this right. It’s hard to put into words.
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, Lilliana. You're explaining it very well. A four out of ten, with a dull ache radiating up your arm, and slightly less on the left hand… that’s very helpful information. Okay, I'm now going to gently move your fingers and wrists through their range of motion. Just relax your hands, and I'll do the work. Hmm. I'm noticing some stiffness when I move your wrists, and a slight grinding sensation – what we call crepitus – in several of your knuckles. Your range of motion is a little limited as well, particularly in this hand. Do you notice this stiffness and limited range of motion when you’re performing everyday tasks?
PATIENT: Oh… crepitus? That sounds… scary. Is that bad? And yes, definitely. It's so hard to open jars, or button my coat, or even just hold a cup of tea. Everything feels… tight and achy. It's especially bad in the mornings, like I said. I have to really force things, and it makes my hands hurt even more. It's getting harder and harder to do things for myself. It's… frustrating. I used to be so independent.
DOCTOR: Crepitus isn’t necessarily scary, Lilliana, but it is a sign of cartilage wear and tear. It's often associated with osteoarthritis, but it can also be caused by other conditions. It sounds like this is significantly impacting your ability to perform daily tasks, and that's understandably frustrating. Now, let's take a look at your knees. If you could please bend your knees, I'll gently feel around the joints to assess for any tenderness or swelling. Okay, how is that feeling?
PATIENT: Oh, my knees… they're not as bad as my hands, but they still ache. Bending them… That’s a little uncomfortable. Not terrible, but… I can feel it. It’s more of a deep ache, rather than a sharp pain. And yes, there’s definitely some swelling, especially on this side. It feels warm too, sometimes. I don’t know if that makes sense. It's worse when I've been standing for a long time, or if I've been walking too much. I try not to overdo it, but… sometimes I forget. It's just getting harder and harder.
DOCTOR: It makes perfect sense, Lilliana. A deep ache, swelling primarily in the right knee, and warmth, exacerbated by standing or walking… that's very helpful. Okay, let’s see how far you can bend your knees. Just go as far as comfortable. Hmm. I’m noticing some crepitus in both knees when you bend them, and a slight limitation in your range of motion, particularly on this side. Do you feel any grinding or clicking sensations when you move your knees?
PATIENT: Yes! That's exactly what it feels like! Grinding… and clicking. Especially when I first get up in the morning. It's… unnerving. It feels like something is loose in there. And sometimes, it just… catches. Like it's going to lock up. It hasn't happened yet, but… I'm afraid it will. It's just… a lot of discomfort. It's making it harder and harder to walk, and I'm afraid I'll fall. I used to love gardening, but… I can't do it anymore. It's just too painful.
DOCTOR: I understand, Lilliana. That grinding and clicking sensation, along with the fear of locking up, is certainly concerning. It sounds like this is significantly impacting your quality of life. Okay, based on the physical exam, your symptoms, and your medical history, it’s highly likely you’re experiencing osteoarthritis in your hands and knees. However, to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other potential causes, I’d like to order some blood tests and X-rays. The blood tests will help us assess for inflammation and rule out other conditions like rheumatoid arthritis. The X-rays will allow us to visualize the joints and assess the extent of cartilage damage. Are you comfortable with me ordering these tests?
PATIENT: Blood tests and X-rays… Oh dear. That sounds… serious. But… I suppose it’s better to know, right? If that's what you think is best, then yes. Yes, go ahead. I trust your judgment, Doctor. I just… I hope it’s not something terrible. And… how much will these tests cost? I don’t have much money, and I don’t have good insurance. I don't want to get a big bill. I’m worried about that. Is there any way to… keep the costs down?
DOCTOR: That's a very reasonable concern, Lilliana. It's perfectly alright to be worried about the cost. We'll do everything we can to keep it as affordable as possible. Let me see… the blood tests should cost around $150, and the X-rays around $200. Some labs offer financial assistance programs for patients with limited income, and we can explore those options for you. We also have a patient advocate who can help you navigate the billing process and potentially negotiate lower rates. I’ll write you a referral for the blood tests and X-rays, and I'll also provide you with information on the financial assistance programs and the patient advocate. Would you like me to go over the details of the tests with you now, and explain what to expect?
PATIENT: Oh, that would be wonderful, Doctor. Thank you. Yes, please. Tell me everything. What exactly will they be doing? And… will it hurt? I don’t like needles, and I’m afraid of… I don’t know… what they might find. Just… explain it to me as simply as possible. And thank you for helping me with the costs. I really appreciate it.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Lilliana. I'll explain everything as simply as possible. For the blood tests, a phlebotomist – a trained professional – will simply draw a small amount of blood from a vein in your arm. You may feel a brief pinch, but it shouldn't be painful. The whole process usually takes just a few minutes. We'll be looking at several different markers in your blood to assess for inflammation and rule out other conditions. For the X-rays, you'll simply stand or sit in front of a machine that takes images of your hands and knees. It’s completely painless and doesn't involve any radiation exposure. The images will allow us to visualize the bones and cartilage in your joints and assess the extent of any damage. The results typically take a few days to come back. Once we have them, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them in detail and develop a treatment plan. In the meantime, I recommend continuing to rest your joints, avoiding activities that exacerbate your pain, and applying ice or heat as needed. We can also discuss some over-the-counter pain relievers that may help alleviate your symptoms. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Yes, that does make sense. A little pinch for the blood, and a picture for the X-ray… It doesn’t sound too bad. But… what if they find something terrible? What if I need surgery? I’m really scared, Doctor. I’m an old woman, and I don’t want to go through all that. I just want to be able to live comfortably, and take care of myself. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: It's perfectly alright to be scared, Lilliana. It's natural to worry about the unknown. And no, wanting to live comfortably and take care of yourself is not too much to ask. Let’s not jump to conclusions. The vast majority of people with osteoarthritis do not require surgery. In fact, many people can manage their symptoms effectively with conservative treatments like physical therapy, medication, and lifestyle modifications. If the X-rays do show significant damage, we’ll discuss all of your options in detail, and we’ll make a decision together. Surgery is always a last resort. For now, let’s focus on getting the tests done and seeing what the results show. We’ll take things one step at a time. I'm here to support you every step of the way. Do you have any other questions or concerns right now?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. You’ve explained everything very clearly, Doctor. I’m still scared, but… I feel a little bit better knowing that you’re here to help me. And thank you for being so patient with me. I worry a lot, and I’m not very good at explaining things. I appreciate your kindness. I suppose I should schedule the tests, then? When is a good time to come back? And… where do I go? I don’t want to get lost.
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Lilliana. It’s my pleasure to help. And please, don’t worry about explaining things. You’ve done a wonderful job. Alright, let’s schedule the tests. The lab is just across the street, at 123 Main Street. You can go anytime Monday through Friday between 8:00 am and 5:00 pm. You don’t need an appointment. Just tell them Dr. Delacour sent you. The X-ray facility is a little further away, at 456 Oak Avenue. They require appointments, so I’ll schedule that for you now. How about Wednesday at 10:00 am?
PATIENT: Wednesday at 10:00 am sounds good. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been so helpful. I really appreciate everything you’ve done for me today. I think… I think that’s all. I’m going to go home now and… try not to worry too much. Thank you again, Doctor. And… goodbye.
DOCTOR: It was my pleasure, Lilliana. Please, don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before your appointments. And don't worry too much. We’ll take things one step at a time. Take care of yourself, and I’ll see you on Wednesday. .
PATIENT: .
