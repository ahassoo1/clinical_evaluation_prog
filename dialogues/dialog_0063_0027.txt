DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Altine. I am Dr. Jules. Now, please, tell me what brings you in today. I have a rather full schedule, so if we could be concise, that would be appreciated.
PATIENT: Concise, you say? Fine. It's this… burning. Happens mostly after I eat. Food just… comes back up. Not violently, mind you. Just a little. It's bothersome, that's all. And frankly, a waste of a perfectly good meal.
DOCTOR: “Burning,” you say. After meals. And a… regurgitation of food. Hmm. How long has this been occurring, Mr. Altine?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… it's been… well, since last winter, I suppose. Maybe a bit longer. Honestly, I don't keep track of these things. It wasn’t constant then, just now and again. But it’s been more frequent lately. Probably since that Polish sausage festival… though I doubt that's the cause. Good sausages, those were.
DOCTOR: A sausage festival, you say. While I appreciate your… culinary enthusiasm, Mr. Altine, we must focus. "More frequent lately." Can you quantify that for me?
PATIENT: Quantify? What am I, an accountant? Look, it used to be maybe once a month, if that. Now? Now it's… well, after most dinners. Sometimes even with lunch. It's… unpleasant. And it stains the good tablecloth. That's what really bothers my wife, you understand.
DOCTOR: Right. So, roughly after most dinners and sometimes lunch, with a noticeable increase in frequency. Do you experience any other symptoms with this… regurgitation?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Like what? I don't feel sick, if that's what you mean. No fever, no chills. Maybe a bit of… discomfort in my chest, afterwards. Like a fullness. But I'm a big man, I eat a lot. Fullness comes with the territory. It’s not pain, mind you. Just… noticeable.
DOCTOR: “Noticeable fullness.” And no actual pain, you state. Do you experience any difficulty swallowing?
PATIENT: Difficulty swallowing? No, no. Food goes down just fine. Always has. I’m not choking on anything, if that’s what you’re getting at. I enjoy a hearty meal, as I said. A man needs his sustenance. It's just… it doesn't stay down. And frankly, I'm getting tired of picking bits of pierogi off the carpet.
DOCTOR: Very well. No difficulty swallowing. And this occurs with solid foods and liquids?
PATIENT: Well, mostly solids, to be honest. Though last week, a bit of tomato soup came back up. But that was a particularly… thin soup. Probably too much liquid. I prefer something with a bit more… body, you see. Like a good stew. The soup was my wife's doing, bless her heart, but it just wasn’t… substantial enough. Does that make sense? I’m not a doctor, I’m just telling you what happens.
DOCTOR: It does, Mr. Altine, though we are attempting to gather pertinent medical information, not a critique of your wife's culinary choices. So, primarily solids, with a rare instance of a thinner liquid. Now, do you experience any heartburn, or a burning sensation in your chest before the regurgitation occurs?
PATIENT: Heartburn? Now that you mention it… yes. A bit of a… warmth. Not terrible, but noticeable. It usually starts after I’ve been eating for a bit. Then the… fullness. Then the… unfortunate return of the meal. It's all rather unpleasant, really. And it's been happening more and more, as I’ve told you repeatedly. I'm not sure what you need to hear to understand that.
DOCTOR: Right. Heartburn preceding the fullness and regurgitation. Now, Mr. Altine, I'm going to need to perform a brief physical examination. It will involve listening to your heart and lungs, and palpating your abdomen. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Palpating? You’re going to poke my stomach? Look, I'm a large man, Dr. Jules. I don't particularly enjoy being poked. But if you must… just be gentle, alright? And please, don't expect to find anything. I assure you, everything is perfectly… functional. Though a bit upset, lately. Fine. Do what you need to do, and let’s get this over with. I have things to attend to.
DOCTOR: Very well. Please lie back on the examination table. I will listen to your heart and lungs first. Heart sounds are regular, rate is within normal limits. Lungs are clear. Now, I am going to gently press on your abdomen. Please tell me if you experience any pain or discomfort. There is some mild tenderness in the upper abdomen, near the sternum. No guarding or rebound tenderness.
PATIENT: Tenderness? Well, that's not surprising. I told you I wasn't feeling myself lately. It's all this… coming up. It’s probably upset something in there. Honestly, Dr. Jules, I'm not a medical expert, but it seems rather obvious what the problem is. My stomach isn't happy. Now, are you going to give me something for it, or are we going to continue this… poking? Because I really haven't got all day.
DOCTOR: It appears you may be experiencing symptoms consistent with gastritis, or potentially gastroesophageal reflux disease. However, we cannot make a definitive diagnosis without further investigation. I would like to order a few tests. A complete blood count to rule out any underlying infection, and an upper endoscopy to visualize your esophagus and stomach. Does that sound acceptable, Mr. Altine?
PATIENT: Endoscopy? You want to… look inside my stomach? With a camera? Absolutely not. Absolutely not at all. I have no interest in having a camera shoved down my throat. No. I’m perfectly capable of telling you what’s wrong. I eat too much, my stomach gets upset, and things come back up. It’s common sense! Blood count, fine. But no cameras. No poking around. I'll just… try some antacids. My wife has some. I'm sure that will do the trick. Honestly, Dr. Jules, sometimes the simplest solution is the best. Now, can I go? I have a pierogi craving that needs attending to. .
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Altine. I respect your decision. However, I must advise you that without a proper diagnosis, we cannot rule out more serious conditions. If your symptoms worsen, or you experience any bleeding, severe pain, or difficulty swallowing, please seek immediate medical attention. I will order the blood count as you requested. Here is a prescription for a proton pump inhibitor. Take one tablet daily, before breakfast. If your symptoms do not improve within two weeks, please schedule a follow-up appointment. And please, Mr. Altine, consider a more bland diet. Perhaps fewer sausages. You may go. .
