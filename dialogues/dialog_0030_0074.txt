DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Steines. My name is Dr. Quicksey. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Mornin', Doctor. Just Venna is fine. Well, my blood pressure's been actin' up, that's what brought me. My regular doctor said I oughta come see somebody 'bout it, so here I am. Hope you don't mind a visit from an old woman.
DOCTOR: Not at all, Venna. I’m happy to see you. It takes courage to seek medical attention at any age, and I assure you, your concerns are very important. Could you tell me a little more about what you mean by “actin’ up”?
PATIENT: Well, it mostly just feels… heavy, sometimes. Like a weight in my head. And my daughter, bless her heart, she keeps tellin' me I get real quiet when it’s bad. I don’t always notice, but she does. Mostly happens when I'm bakin', if I'm honest. Lots of standin' and fussin', I reckon that ain't helpin'.
DOCTOR: Okay, a heavy feeling and your daughter noticing you become quieter, particularly when you’re baking. That’s helpful information. Do you happen to know what your blood pressure readings have been recently?
PATIENT: Readin’s? Oh dear… I think my daughter wrote some down somewhere. She's always tryin' to keep track of things for me. Let me see… Here it is, I think. Says… 150 over 90. And then a few days later it was 145 over 85. Something like that. Numbers ain’t my best friend, you know.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Venna. Those numbers are a bit elevated, yes. Normal blood pressure is generally considered to be below 120/80. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to check your blood pressure myself, if that's alright. And then we can talk a little more about your overall health. Do you have any other symptoms you’ve been experiencing, like dizziness, blurred vision, or chest pain?
PATIENT: Alright, go ahead and check it. I trust you. Hmm… dizziness, not really. But my eyesight has been gettin' a bit blurry lately, especially when I'm workin' with the tiny sprinkles. And sometimes, when I walk up the steps to my porch, I get a little short of breath. Not a lot, but enough to notice. Chest pain… no, thankfully, never had that.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. Blurred vision and shortness of breath with exertion are important things to mention. Your blood pressure is 152 over 88 right now. That confirms what your daughter recorded. I'm also going to listen to your heart and lungs, just to get a baseline. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Alright, go ahead. Heart and lungs… sounds good. My grandpa always said a good listenin' ear was the best medicine. He was a medicine man, you know. Cherokee, through and through.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful about your grandfather, Venna. Traditional knowledge is incredibly valuable. Your heart sounds a little strong, but I don’t hear any murmurs or irregularities at this time. Your lungs sound clear, though you do have slightly labored breathing, which may be related to the shortness of breath you mentioned. I’d also like to check your pulse and reflexes, and perhaps take a look in your ears and throat. Is that agreeable to you?
PATIENT: Alright, check away. Pulse and reflexes… sounds fine to me. Ears and throat too, if you think it's needed. I ain’t scared of a little lookin' around. Been poked and prodded plenty in my ninety years! Just… be gentle, alright? Old bones, you know.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I will be as gentle as possible. Everything looks reasonably good. Your ears are clear, and your throat is a little dry, but no signs of infection. Now, could you tell me a bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: Medical history… Hmm. Let me see. I had the flu real bad when I was a little girl, nearly didn't make it. And I broke my arm when I was bakin' a pie – tripped over the cat, silly thing. Other than that… not much. I've always been pretty healthy, all things considerin'. No diabetes, no heart trouble 'til recently, and never had any surgeries. I take a little somethin' for my arthritis, that's about it. And a daily aspirin, like the doctor told me to.
DOCTOR: That's helpful to know, Venna. No major medical issues, a broken arm, and you're currently taking medication for arthritis and a daily aspirin. Do you know what medication you take for arthritis, and what the dosage is?
PATIENT: Oh, land… now you're askin' things! My daughter handles all that. Let me see… Here it is… Naproxen, 500 milligrams, twice a day. That's what she tells me, anyway. I just take what she gives me. She's a good girl, always lookin' out for me.
DOCTOR: That’s good, Venna. Naproxen is a common medication for arthritis. Do you have any allergies to medications or anything else, like foods or pollen?
PATIENT: Hmm… allergies… not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anythin'. I eat just about anythin' put in front of me, bless my soul. Maybe a little heartburn sometimes when I eat somethin' spicy, but that's it. Pollen… well, I sneeze a little in the spring, like everybody else, but it ain't never laid me up in bed. I reckon I'm pretty lucky that way.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Venna. No known allergies. Now, could you tell me a bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle… Well, at ninety years old, it ain't much of a lifestyle! Mostly I stay home, bakin' and watchin' television. My daughter brings me groceries and takes me to the doctor. I used to garden a lot when my husband was still around, but it's too much for me now. I don’t smoke, never have. And I only drink a little wine with dinner sometimes, just a glass or two. Mostly just tryin' to take it easy these days.
DOCTOR: That sounds very reasonable, Venna. So, no smoking, limited alcohol consumption, and mostly a quiet lifestyle at home. Based on what you’ve told me, and my examination today, your elevated blood pressure is the primary concern. The blurry vision and shortness of breath could be related, and we need to investigate further. I'd like to order some blood work and a urine test to get a better understanding of your overall health. I'd also like to get an EKG to check your heart function. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Sounds sensible. Tests and such… alright, go ahead and do what you think is best. Blood work, urine test, EKG… I trust your judgment, Doctor. Just… try not to poke too many holes in me, alright? Old skin tears easy, you know.
DOCTOR: I promise, Venna, I’ll be as gentle as possible. We'll take our time. I’ll also write you a prescription for a blood pressure medication to start, a low dose of lisinopril. It's important to get your blood pressure under control to prevent any serious complications. And I'm going to recommend you follow up with a cardiologist, just to get a specialist’s opinion. Would you like me to explain any of these things in more detail?
PATIENT: Lisinopril… alright. And a heart doctor, huh? Well, if you think it's best. I reckon I'm gettin' too old for all this fussin'. Explain it a little, maybe. What's this medicine do, exactly? And what's a cardiologist gonna do, poke around in my heart with a stick?
DOCTOR: Lisinopril is a medication that helps to relax your blood vessels, which makes it easier for your heart to pump blood and lowers your blood pressure. Think of your blood vessels like hoses - if they're tight, it takes more effort to push water through them. Lisinopril helps to widen those hoses, so your heart doesn't have to work so hard. As for the cardiologist, they won’t poke around in your heart with a stick! They’re heart specialists. They may want to do an echocardiogram, which is a non-invasive test that uses sound waves to create a picture of your heart. It doesn't involve any needles or incisions. They might also recommend a stress test, where you walk on a treadmill while they monitor your heart function. It will help to get a better picture of your heart health. Do you have any questions about any of that?
PATIENT: Hoses… I like that. Makes sense. And no stick, that's good. Sound waves, alright. That don't sound too bad. Stress test… well, walkin' on a treadmill at my age, that might be the stressful part! I reckon I understand, mostly. My daughter's pretty good at explainin' these things too, so I can ask her if I get confused. When do I need to see this heart doctor? And what about the blood work? Where do I go for that?
DOCTOR: That’s great, Venna, and I’m glad your daughter is a good resource. I’ll write you a referral to Dr. Ramirez, a cardiologist at the clinic in town. His office will contact you to schedule an appointment. It's usually within a few weeks, but you can let them know if you have any urgent concerns. As for the blood work, you can go to the lab right across the street. I’ll give you a lab requisition form with specific instructions. They’ll draw a small sample of blood and send the results back to me. I should have them within a few days. Here are the forms, and a printout summarizing the medication instructions. Please call my office if you have any questions or experience any side effects from the lisinopril. I also recommend you avoid salt intake as much as possible, it can raise blood pressure. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: Alright, lots of papers… I’ll have to give these to my daughter. Dr. Ramirez, lab across the street, no salt… I think I got it. No, Doctor, I think that's all for now. You’ve been real patient with an old woman. Thank you for takin’ care of me. I appreciate it. I suppose I'll be seein' you again soon. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Venna. It was a pleasure meeting you. Please don’t hesitate to contact my office if you need anything at all. And remember, listen to your body and don’t be afraid to ask questions. Have a good day, and please give my best to your daughter.
