DOCTOR: Good morning, Mirriam. It's lovely to meet you. I’m Dr. Latisia Finco. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you as well. Well, it’s these hiccups. They just won’t stop. Been going on for… goodness, feels like a week now. Not painful, just… irritating, you know? And constant.
DOCTOR: Yes, I can imagine that would be quite frustrating. A week of constant hiccups… Alright. Can you tell me a little more about them?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think. They started… right after I had a lovely lunch with my daughter, actually. We went to that new cafe downtown, the one with the fancy sandwiches. I had a tuna melt and a big glass of iced tea. Nothing seemed unusual at the time. Then, a little while later… hic… they started. And they haven’t really let up since. I’ve tried holding my breath, drinking water upside down… all the usual things. Nothing seems to work.
DOCTOR: Okay, a tuna melt and iced tea… and then the hiccups started shortly after. And you've tried some of the common home remedies without success. Do you recall anything else unusual about that lunch?
PATIENT: Unusual? Hmmm… well, the cafe was very busy. Lots of people. And it was quite warm in there, I remember feeling a little flushed. Oh! And my daughter reminded me just yesterday that I was laughing a lot – she was telling me a funny story about her cat. Does that sound like it could be something?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s helpful. Warm environment and a good laugh… those can sometimes be triggers. And it’s good to know it started so closely after the lunch. Now, besides the hiccups themselves, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… Let me see. No, not really. I haven't felt sick or anything. No fever, no tummy trouble. Just… the hiccups! I’m sleeping okay, eating okay… I just feel a bit tired, I suppose, from being interrupted all the time. It’s more annoying than anything, but it’s starting to wear me down.
DOCTOR: Alright, no other symptoms – just the persistent hiccups and a bit of fatigue. I see from your chart you don't have a history of any major medical conditions. Are you currently taking any medications or do you have any known allergies?
PATIENT: No major conditions, that’s right. And no, I don't take any regular medications. Just a little something for my arthritis when it flares up, but that's all. And no allergies, not that I know of. I've always been pretty lucky that way. I used to help my husband in his garden, so I’m used to a bit of everything – pollen, dirt, the whole lot! Didn't bother me none.
DOCTOR: Okay, no regular medications, no known allergies, and a little something for arthritis as needed. Let’s do a quick physical exam, just to rule out anything obvious. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and have a look at your throat. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s perfectly alright, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. Go right ahead. It’s probably nothing, but it’s good to be sure, isn't it?
DOCTOR: Alright, everything sounds clear here, lungs are good and heart rhythm is regular. Your throat doesn’t seem irritated or swollen. Blood pressure is 130/80, which is a little elevated, but not concerning at your age. I don’t notice any obvious signs of what might be causing the hiccups. Now, sometimes hiccups can be caused by something simple, like irritation of the diaphragm. But given how long they’ve been going on, we might want to run a few tests just to be on the safe side. Would you be okay with a blood test to check your electrolyte levels, and possibly a chest X-ray?
PATIENT: Oh, okay. Tests… alright. If you think it’s best, then yes, let’s do them. I’d rather be safe than sorry. Electrolytes and a chest X-ray… sounds good. Will they be uncomfortable? I don’t mind a little poke, but I don't like being stuck in those big machines.
DOCTOR: The blood test will be just a little poke, you're right, and shouldn't be too uncomfortable. As for the chest X-ray, it’s very quick. You’ll just stand in front of a plate and I'll ask you to take a deep breath. No lying down or anything complicated. It doesn’t require any special preparation. We'll send you to the lab right away. I’ll also write a referral for a gastroenterology consult, just in case it turns out to be something related to your digestive system. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Oh, okay. That doesn't sound too bad. Just a quick breath… I can manage that. And a visit with a stomach doctor… alright. Seems sensible. If you think it’s worth checking, then yes, let’s do it. I just want these hiccups to stop. It’s driving me a bit crazy, you know? Do you think it could be serious? I’m not wanting to worry my daughter.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, and it's good you're thinking of your daughter. Most of the time, hiccups are benign and resolve on their own, or with simple treatments. However, because yours have persisted for a week, we're just being thorough to rule out anything more serious. The tests will give us a clearer picture. It’s unlikely to be anything extremely serious, but it's always best to investigate when something isn't resolving as expected. We’ll get the results back quickly, and I’ll call you with the findings as soon as they’re available. I'm writing a prescription for a medication called baclofen. It’s a muscle relaxant sometimes used to help stop hiccups. It's not always effective, but it's worth a try while we're waiting for the test results. We’ll start with a low dose, and you can increase it if needed, following the instructions on the label. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: Baclofen, you say? A muscle relaxant… Hmm. Never taken anything like that before. Okay, I'll take it as prescribed. I’m always a bit wary of new medications, but I trust your judgment, Doctor. What kind of side effects should I be looking out for? And is it okay to take it with a cup of tea?
DOCTOR: That's a very good question. Baclofen can cause drowsiness, dizziness, and sometimes muscle weakness. It’s important to be careful when driving or operating machinery while you’re taking it. You might also feel a little lightheaded when you stand up quickly, so take your time. And as for the tea… it's generally okay to take baclofen with a cup of tea, but avoid excessive amounts of caffeine, as that could worsen any potential side effects like anxiety or restlessness. I'll also give you a handout with more detailed information about the medication, including a list of potential side effects and drug interactions. Do you have any other questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. That all sounds… manageable. A little drowsiness is better than constant hiccups, I suppose. And I’ll be careful with the caffeine. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly, Doctor. You’ve put my mind at ease a bit. I appreciate you taking the time to listen and run these tests. Hopefully, it's just a little something simple.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mirriam. I'm glad I could help put your mind at ease. We’ll get those tests done and hopefully, we’ll have some answers soon. Just remember to follow the instructions on the handout and don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns. The nurse will come in shortly to escort you to the lab. Have a good day, and please, try to relax. And hopefully, those hiccups will be gone before you know it. .
PATIENT: Thank you again, Doctor. You too. I’ll see you when the test results come in.
