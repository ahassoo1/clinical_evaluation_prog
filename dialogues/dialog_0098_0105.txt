DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kochubey. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Bombara. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Uh… well, I’m here about getting surgery. For my weight, you know? I think it’s… a pre-surgery check-up? It’s all a bit fuzzy, honestly. My wife mostly handled setting everything up.
DOCTOR: Alright, a pre-surgical evaluation for weight loss surgery. Yes, that makes sense. It is often helpful to have a check-up beforehand. And it's perfectly alright if details are a bit unclear – we can sort everything out together. Just to be sure I have the right information, are you planning on having a specific type of weight loss surgery?
PATIENT: Um… I really don't know, Doctor. I think it had something to do with…staples? Or maybe bypassing something? My wife mentioned a name, but it slipped my mind. I just know she said it was the safest option, and… well, I trust her. I'm not very good with remembering these kinds of things. Sorry.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all, Mr. Kochubey. These things can be overwhelming, and it's good you have someone helping you. Let me see if I can pull up the details of the surgery scheduled through our system… Ah, yes. It looks like you are scheduled for a Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass with Mr. Henderson. Is that right?
PATIENT: Roux-en-Y… Henderson… yeah, that sounds right! That’s the name my wife said. Henderson. He's a surgeon, right? I haven’t actually met him yet, just talked to him on the phone quickly, I think. It was all very fast. Is he… good? Sorry, that probably sounds silly.
DOCTOR: Not silly at all, Mr. Kochubey. It’s perfectly reasonable to want to know about your surgeon. Mr. Henderson is an excellent surgeon, very experienced in bariatric surgery. He has a good reputation here at the clinic. Now, let’s focus on this pre-surgical evaluation. To get a good picture of your overall health, could you tell me a little bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: Okay, good. That makes me feel a bit better. My medical history… hmm. I don’t really… have much, I think? I haven’t been to the doctor in… a long time, honestly. I usually just try to push through things. I had… the usual childhood stuff, I guess - chickenpox, maybe? Nothing serious. I think I broke my arm once when I was a kid. I haven’t had any major illnesses or surgeries before this, that I remember anyway. I do have… high blood pressure, my wife tells me. She's always on me about it. But I don’t take anything for it.
DOCTOR: Alright, so generally good health, childhood illnesses, a history of high blood pressure… and you aren’t currently taking any medications for it. That’s good to know. Do you happen to know what your blood pressure readings typically are, or when it was last checked?
PATIENT: No, I don't, Doctor. I really don’t. My wife usually handles all that. She has a little machine at home, I think, but she doesn't usually tell me the numbers, just says it's "a little high" and tells me to watch my salt. I'm really bad with numbers, you see. It all just… goes in one ear and out the other. Sorry again. I feel like I’m not being very helpful.
DOCTOR: You’re being perfectly helpful, Mr. Kochubey. It’s alright if you don’t remember specific details. We can get the information we need. It’s more important that you’re here today so we can make sure you’re healthy enough for surgery. Let's move on to some other questions, then. Have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I haven’t. Not that I remember, anyway. Like I said, I haven’t really needed to go to the doctor much. Just the broken arm when I was a kid, and that wasn’t a surgery, just a cast. I think. My wife might remember more details, she has a better memory than me. I’m not sure about anything else. This is all a little overwhelming, to be honest. I just want to feel better, you know? That’s why I’m doing this surgery.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Kochubey. It is a big step, and it's perfectly normal to feel overwhelmed. We'll take things one step at a time. Alright, let’s talk about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, diabetes, high blood pressure, or cancer?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a tough one. My family… well, we don’t really talk about health stuff much. It’s not really part of our culture, you know? I know my father had… something with his heart, I think. He passed away when I was young. And my mother… she has diabetes, I think. But I don’t really know much about it. We don’t keep track of these things. Sorry. I wish I could be more helpful. It's just… I wasn't raised to think about these things. It's like, you just deal with it when it happens, and don't worry about it beforehand.
DOCTOR: I appreciate you sharing that with me, Mr. Kochubey. It’s helpful to understand your background. So, a history of heart issues in your father and diabetes in your mother. We can work with that. Now, thinking about your lifestyle… do you smoke or use tobacco in any form?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, never. I don’t smoke. My wife… she used to, a long time ago, but she quit years ago. I’ve always been against it. It's bad for you, you know? I try to stay as healthy as I can, even if I… struggle with my weight. I try to eat well, but it's hard. And I don’t drink much either. Maybe a beer with dinner sometimes, but that's about it.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear, Mr. Kochubey. No tobacco use is excellent. And occasional alcohol consumption is generally not a concern. Now, let's talk about allergies. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not that I know of. I haven't had any bad reactions to anything. I eat pretty much everything. My wife sometimes makes me try new foods, even if I’m not sure about them. I haven’t ever had to go to the hospital for an allergic reaction or anything like that. I think I would remember that, right? I guess I'm just not an allergic person. It’s another thing I don’t really worry about.
DOCTOR: That's good to know, Mr. Kochubey. No known allergies. Let’s move on to medications. Are you currently taking any prescription or over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing. Like I said before, I don’t really take anything. My wife keeps telling me I should take something for my blood pressure, but I haven’t gotten around to it yet. I don’t like taking pills, you know? I just… avoid it. I try to manage things on my own. I eat healthy when I can, and try to walk a little bit. I guess I'm just stubborn. I don’t want to rely on medications if I don't have to. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It makes perfect sense, Mr. Kochubey. You prefer to manage things naturally, if possible. Alright. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical exam, if that’s alright with you. Just to get a baseline reading and make sure everything looks good before your surgery. We'll start with checking your blood pressure, pulse, and listening to your heart and lungs. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds… okay. I guess it makes sense to check everything. I’m a little nervous, to be honest. I haven’t been to the doctor in a long time. But if you think it’s necessary, then go ahead. Just… be gentle, okay? I don't like pain. And try not to take too long, if you don’t mind. My wife is waiting in the car.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Kochubey. I’ll be as gentle as possible, and we won’t take long. I understand you’re nervous, and I’ll explain everything as we go. Okay, just relax your arm for me. Your blood pressure is 160 over 95. A bit elevated, as your wife mentioned. Pulse is 88 and regular. Your heart sounds are regular, but I do hear a slight murmur. It’s not immediately concerning, but we’ll want to investigate further. Lungs are clear. Your abdomen is soft, but there's some fullness. Overall, everything seems stable, but the elevated blood pressure and murmur are things we need to address before your surgery.
PATIENT: Murmur? What’s a murmur? Is that… bad? I don’t understand. And what does “address” mean? Does that mean I can’t have the surgery? My wife is going to be so disappointed. I just want to feel better, you know? I thought this surgery was supposed to help me, not make things more complicated. I’m starting to get really worried now. Is there something seriously wrong with me?
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Kochubey, let's take a deep breath. A murmur is just an extra sound your heart makes when blood flows through it. It doesn’t automatically mean there’s something seriously wrong, but it does mean we need to investigate it further to understand what's causing it. "Address" simply means we need to find out more information before proceeding with surgery, to make sure it’s safe for you. It doesn't necessarily mean you can’t have it, but we need to be cautious. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to order an EKG – that’s a simple test to record your heart’s electrical activity – and an echocardiogram, which is an ultrasound of your heart. This will help us determine the cause of the murmur and if it will affect your surgery. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: EKG… echocardiogram… those sound… scary. Ultrasounds aren’t so bad, my wife had one when she was pregnant, but the EKG… is that painful? Will it take a long time? I just want to get this over with. And what if they find something bad? What if I can’t have the surgery at all? My wife… she’s been so hopeful. I don’t want to disappoint her. This is all so overwhelming, Doctor. I wish I hadn’t come in. Maybe I’m just not meant to have this surgery.
DOCTOR: Mr. Kochubey, it’s perfectly normal to feel overwhelmed right now. These tests are not scary, I promise. An EKG is completely painless – it involves placing small stickers on your chest to record your heart’s electrical activity. It takes just a few minutes. The echocardiogram is also non-invasive; a technician will use a probe on your chest to create images of your heart. It's important to remember we aren't looking for bad news, we're simply gathering information to ensure your safety and the best possible outcome. Many people have these tests, and it doesn't necessarily mean there’s a problem. Let’s focus on taking things one step at a time. First, we’ll get these tests done. Then, we’ll discuss the results and determine the best course of action. I will be here with you every step of the way. Would you like me to call your wife and explain this to her?
PATIENT: Yes, please. That would be… really helpful. I can’t explain it to her, I get too flustered. And she’ll want to know everything, every little detail. She’s very… thorough. Maybe you can tell her what the tests are for, and what to expect. And… and if it looks bad, maybe she can help me make a decision. I just… I don’t want to disappoint her. She’s been so supportive, she deserves the best outcome. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very patient with me. I really appreciate it.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Kochubey. That’s what I’m here for. I’m happy to explain everything to your wife. “Hello, Mrs. Kochubey?
