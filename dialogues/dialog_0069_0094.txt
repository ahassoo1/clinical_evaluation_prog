DOCTOR: Good morning, Airam. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Andraca. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me a bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Um… good morning. I think… my husband told me to come. Something about… learning things? I work with metal, you know. Sheets. Big sheets. It’s… hard work. I don't really feel sick or anything.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It sounds like your husband is concerned about your work and potential health effects, and you're here to discuss that. That's very thoughtful of both of you. Just to clarify, when you say you work with metal sheets, could you tell me a little more about what you do with them?
PATIENT: What do I… do? Ugh. I cut them. And… bend them. And sometimes… join them together. With… things. Machines. And… sparks. Lots of sparks. It's noisy. Very noisy. And… dusty, I guess. I wear a mask sometimes. My husband buys them for me.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you’re cutting, bending, and joining metal sheets, using machines that create sparks and noise, and it generates dust. You wear a mask sometimes, but not always. That gives me a better picture. To understand what might be going on, and to make sure we cover everything, let's go through a few questions. First, how long have you been doing this type of work?
PATIENT: Long…? A long time. Maybe… ten years? Or more? I don’t really… keep track. It’s just… work. Before that… I did other things. Not important things. Just… jobs. My husband, he likes that I have a job now. It’s steady.
DOCTOR: Okay, about ten years or more. That’s helpful. And it’s good that you have steady work. Now, thinking about those ten years, have you noticed any changes in your health since you started this work?
PATIENT: Changes…? Hmm. Let me think. My hands… they ache sometimes. More than they used to. And… I cough. A little. But everyone coughs, right? Especially when it's… dusty. I don't think it's anything special. I just… take some medicine. The red one. My husband gives it to me.
DOCTOR: Okay, so some aching hands and a cough you’ve attributed to the dust. And you take a red medicine your husband provides. To help me understand the cough better, could you describe it?
PATIENT: Describe…? It’s… a cough. A normal cough! You know, like when you have a cold. Sometimes it’s dry. Sometimes… it has stuff. A little. Not a lot. It's… annoying, I guess. It doesn’t keep me up at night or anything. I just… clear my throat a lot.
DOCTOR: Okay, a cough that sometimes produces a little bit of mucus, and you clear your throat frequently. That's helpful. Now, let's talk about the aching hands. Is it just in your hands, or does it affect other joints as well?
PATIENT: Just my hands, mostly. And my wrists, a little. It’s… when I’m using the machines. The big cutters. They… vibrate. A lot. It feels… tingly. And then it aches. Like I used too much strength. I rest them. And then it goes away. Usually.
DOCTOR: Okay, aching and tingling in your hands and wrists, especially when using the vibrating machines, and it improves with rest. Do you experience any numbness or weakness in your hands or fingers?
PATIENT: Numbness…? Weakness…? I don't… I don't think so. Maybe… sometimes my fingers feel… cold. But it's cold in the shop sometimes! It’s not… always warm. I wear gloves, when I remember.
DOCTOR: Okay, so occasionally cold fingers, but you're not sure if it's related to your work. You wear gloves sometimes. Now, let's briefly go through some other things, just to make sure we're not missing anything. Have you noticed any changes in your breathing?
PATIENT: Breathing…? Like… shortness of breath? Not really. I mean, I get tired after a long day. It’s hard work, you know? But… I don’t have trouble… walking up stairs or anything. My husband worries about everything. He says I should… slow down. But I need the money.
DOCTOR: Okay, no shortness of breath, just fatigue from hard work. Your husband is concerned about you slowing down, which is understandable. Have you experienced any chest pain, or a persistent sore throat?
PATIENT: Chest pain…? No. Never. Sore throat…? Sometimes. But that’s just… from the dust, I think. It’s scratchy. Like something’s stuck. I drink tea. Hot tea with honey. That helps a little.
DOCTOR: Okay, no chest pain, just occasional scratchy throat from the dust, relieved somewhat by tea with honey. Now, one last quick question before we move on to a physical exam. Have you noticed any changes in your skin?
PATIENT: Skin…? Hmm. It’s… dry, I guess. From the dust. And sometimes I get… little cuts. From the metal. But I wash them. With soap. My husband tells me to be careful. He worries a lot about infections.
DOCTOR: Okay, dry skin with occasional cuts from the metal, which you wash. Alright, Airam, thank you for answering all those questions. It sounds like you’ve been doing physically demanding work for a long time, and there are a few things we should check out. Would you be comfortable if I did a quick physical exam?
PATIENT: Exam…? What will you do? I don't like being poked and prodded. I just wanted to learn things, not… be a patient. My husband said this doctor was good. He said you wouldn't… waste my time.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Airam. I definitely don't want to waste your time. The exam will be fairly quick and straightforward. I'll listen to your lungs, check your heart, and examine your hands and wrists. I’ll also take a look at your throat. It will help me understand if any of your symptoms might be related to your work environment. I’ll explain everything as I go, and you can stop me at any time if you’re uncomfortable. Would you like me to proceed with the exam?
PATIENT: Fine. But be quick. And don't poke too hard. My hands are important. I need them for work. And… tell me what you’re doing. Don’t just… surprise me.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I will explain everything as I go, and I’ll be as gentle as possible. First, I’m going to listen to your lungs with this stethoscope. It helps me hear how well you’re breathing. Take a deep breath in… and out… good. And again… Your breathing sounds… relatively clear, but I do hear some slight wheezing. That could be due to a number of things, and we'll need to investigate further. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart.
PATIENT: Wheezing…? Is that bad? My husband told me I should see a specialist if I started wheezing. He worries about my lungs. He used to work in a factory, you know. He says the dust… gets in your lungs. Don’t tell him I told you that. He thinks I’m strong.
DOCTOR: It's good that your husband is looking out for you, and that he has experience with factory work. Some wheezing can be a sign of a lung problem, which is why we need to look into it. But it doesn’t automatically mean something is seriously wrong. Many things can cause wheezing, like a mild allergy or even a recent cold. Your heart sounds regular. Now, let’s take a look at your hands and wrists. I notice some mild swelling in your wrists, and some redness on your knuckles. Do you feel any pain when I do this?
PATIENT: Ouch! That hurts a little. Especially here… It’s always sore here. I think… from twisting the metal. My husband says I need to use more… machines. Less hand work. But the machines are expensive. And… I don’t like them as much.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see. This area is quite tender to the touch. It feels like there might be some inflammation here. This could be related to repetitive motion, like twisting the metal. It’s a common condition called De Quervain's tenosynovitis. Does the pain get worse when you grip things or twist your wrist?
PATIENT: De… what-something? That’s a long word. And… yes. It hurts when I… grip things. Like… when I’m using the pliers. Or… when I’m opening jars. My husband has to open the jars for me sometimes. He says I’m getting weak. But I’m not! I just… have sore hands. It's the metal. It's hard work.
DOCTOR: De Quervain's tenosynovitis is inflammation of the tendons on the thumb side of your wrist. It’s common in people who do a lot of repetitive hand motions, like gripping and twisting. It sounds like that’s very likely what’s going on in your case. Now, let me quickly take a look at your throat. Your throat is a little red, but there's no significant swelling. That could just be from the dust irritating it. Okay, Airam, that completes the exam. I have a few ideas about what might be going on, and I’d like to discuss some options with you.
PATIENT: Options…? Like… medicine? Or… do I have to stop working? My husband will be so happy if I stop working. But I need the money. And I like my job. Even if my hands hurt sometimes. What kind of options? Tell me quickly, please. I have things to do.
DOCTOR: I understand you're concerned about stopping work, and we’re not at that point yet. We have a few options we can explore. First, the slight wheezing I heard could be due to irritation from the dust, or a mild allergic reaction. I’d like to recommend a simple breathing test, called spirometry, just to get a better idea of how your lungs are functioning. We can do that here at the clinic. Second, the pain in your wrists sounds like De Quervain's tenosynovitis. We can try a few things to manage that. I recommend a wrist splint to support your wrist, especially when you're doing repetitive motions. We can also discuss some over-the-counter pain relievers, like ibuprofen or naproxen, to help with the inflammation. Finally, I’d like to talk about ways to minimize your exposure to dust at work. Do you have access to a good quality dust mask?
PATIENT: Dust mask…? Yes. I have one. But it’s… uncomfortable. And it makes it hard to breathe. My husband buys them for me. He says I should wear it all the time. But I don’t. It makes my glasses fog up. And I can’t see. Then I’ll cut myself. Splint…? Like… a cast? Will I have to stop working? I need to make money. My husband will be so happy if I stop working but then we won’t be able to pay the bills. This is complicated.
DOCTOR: It is complicated, and I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly. A splint won’t be like a full cast, it’s a removable support to help stabilize your wrist and reduce the strain on the tendons. You can still work with a splint, but it will help to prevent further irritation. Regarding the dust mask, I understand it’s uncomfortable and fogs up your glasses. Perhaps we can look at a different type of mask, one that fits better and allows for better ventilation. There are also anti-fogging sprays you can use for your glasses. To get a better understanding of your lung function, I do recommend the breathing test, just to rule out any underlying issues. It’s a quick and painless procedure. For now, let’s focus on managing the wrist pain. I can show you how to properly apply a wrist splint, and we can discuss some exercises to strengthen your wrist muscles. Would you like me to proceed with the breathing test, and show you how to use the splint?
PATIENT: Okay… fine. The breathing test first. Then the splint. But if it makes my hands worse, I’m stopping. My husband will be so happy. And if it takes too long, I have things to do. Please be quick. And explain everything. Don’t just… poke and prod.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I will explain everything as we go, and we'll take it slow. I understand your concerns and will respect your time. Okay, this is the spirometry machine. It’s a breathing test that measures how much air you can inhale and exhale, and how quickly you can do it. I’m going to ask you to take a deep breath in through your mouth, and then blow out as hard and as long as you can into this mouthpiece. It will take a few tries. Are you ready?
PATIENT: Okay… I guess so. It looks… complicated. And… I don’t want to get dizzy. My husband gets dizzy easily. And I have to go pick up groceries later. And I need to make dinner. Please be quick. This looks… hard.
DOCTOR: It’s not too hard, I promise. And we’ll take breaks if you need them. I’ll be right here the whole time. I just want to get a quick snapshot of your lung function. Okay, take a deep breath in… and blow out as hard and as long as you can. Don’t worry about how it sounds, just blow! Good! That was great. Now, let’s do it two more times to make sure we get a consistent reading. Take another deep breath in… and blow! Excellent! That’s all we need. Let’s take a look at the results. Okay, the results are back. Your lung function is slightly reduced, which could be due to irritation from the dust, or a mild allergic reaction. It's not severe, but it’s something we need to keep an eye on. Now, let's move on to the wrist splint.
PATIENT: Reduced…? Is that bad? My husband always says I should see a specialist. He says dust is very dangerous. And… if it's reduced, does that mean I have to stop working? Splint… okay. But I have small hands. Will it fit? And I need to be able to use my tools. I can’t just… sit around. And what if it gets dirty? I need to finish the metal work for Mr. Henderson. He’s a good customer. Please be quick, please. I don’t want to worry my husband.
DOCTOR: “Reduced” doesn’t automatically mean you have to stop working, Airam. It just means there’s a slight decrease in your lung capacity, and it's something we want to monitor. We can discuss this with a specialist if you’d like, but for now, we can try some simple measures to improve your lung health and see if that helps. Regarding the splint, don't worry, we have several sizes. Let’s find one that fits comfortably and allows you to use your hands. It should support your wrist without restricting your movement completely. We can adjust it to ensure a comfortable fit. And don’t worry about it getting dirty. It’s made of durable material that can be wiped clean. We can also provide a few extra to keep on hand. Let’s try this one. Can you bend your wrist?
PATIENT: It’s… tight. And it feels… strange. I can’t move it as easily. What if I drop something? I need to be careful with the tools. And… it makes my hand feel… numb. Maybe… it’s too tight? My husband always says I should listen to my body. He says I need to be careful. I don't want to hurt myself.
DOCTOR: You’re right, it does feel a bit tight. Let’s loosen it up a bit. It shouldn’t be so restrictive that it cuts off your circulation or causes numbness. How does that feel now?
PATIENT: Better… a little. But it still feels… awkward. And I’m worried I’ll accidentally bump into something. I work in a small space. And I need to be able to grip the metal firmly. Maybe… a splint isn’t a good idea. It’s too much trouble. I just want to be able to work. And I don't want to worry my husband. He gets anxious enough as it is.
DOCTOR: You’re right to listen to your body, Airam. If the splint feels too restrictive or uncomfortable, it’s not going to be helpful. It's more important to prioritize your comfort and safety. Perhaps we can explore some other options. We can try some over-the-counter pain relievers to manage the discomfort, and I can show you some gentle exercises to strengthen your wrist muscles and improve your range of motion. We can also discuss ways to minimize your exposure to dust at work. Would you like to try those options instead?
PATIENT: Yes… please. Pain relievers and exercises… that sounds better. And… maybe some tips for the dust. But not a mask. I can’t wear a mask. My glasses fog up. And I can’t see. My husband will be happy if I don’t have to wear a mask. He worries about me getting hurt. He’s a good man. But he gets anxious about everything.
DOCTOR: That sounds like a good plan, Airam. We can definitely focus on pain relievers and exercises, and I can provide you with some tips to minimize dust exposure. We won't push the mask if it's not comfortable. For the pain, I recommend an over-the-counter anti-inflammatory like ibuprofen or naproxen. Follow the dosage instructions on the label. And for exercises, there are a few simple stretches and strengthening exercises you can do to improve your wrist mobility and strength. These exercises are best done a few times a day, and it's important to listen to your body and stop if you feel any pain. As for the dust, I recommend keeping your work area as clean as possible, and using a damp cloth to wipe down surfaces regularly. You can also try using a fan to circulate the air and keep the dust from settling. And, of course, avoiding prolonged exposure to dust is always a good idea. Does that sound manageable?
PATIENT: Manageable… I guess so. But I’m not very good with… computers. And I have a lot of work to do. And I always forget things. Maybe… I can write it down. And my husband can help me remember. He’s good with… details. And he worries about me. He’ll want to know all this. Can you… write down the exercises? And the instructions for the pain relievers? And the tips for the dust? Just so I don’t forget anything. My husband will be happy.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Airam. I'm happy to write everything down for you. Here you go. This includes everything we discussed. It also has some helpful websites and resources if you'd like to learn more. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all. You’ve been very helpful. And patient. Even though I forget things. And I’m not very good with… computers. My husband will be happy. He always wants me to… take care of myself. And you gave me some good ideas. Thank you. I should probably go. I have to pick up groceries and make dinner. And my husband will be wondering where I am. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Airam. I’m glad I could help. Remember to listen to your body, and don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. And please, encourage your husband to come in with you for your next checkup. It’s always good to have someone there to support you. It was a pleasure meeting you, and I wish you all the best. Have a good evening, and please, take care.
PATIENT: Thank you! You too!
