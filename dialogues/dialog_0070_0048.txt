DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Lason. My name is Dr. Abady. It's a pleasure to meet you. I see you’re here today. Could you tell me what brings you in?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Abady, you said? Well, it's about these… spells, I suppose you'd call them. My wife, she worries, keeps saying I’m not myself. Frankly, she often exaggerates, but this time… even I have to admit something's off. It’s like… moments where I just… lose track. Not all the time, mind you. Just… here and there.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Lason. It's good that you're seeking medical attention, and it's wise of your wife to encourage you to come in when she notices changes. These “spells,” as you call them, losing track of things… can you tell me a little more about what that feels like?
PATIENT: Feels like… well, like a skipped record. You know, like the needle jumps and you hear the same bit twice. Except it's not music, it’s… thoughts. Or, not thoughts exactly. It's more like… knowing I should know something, but the word… the name… it's just… gone. Then, usually quick as anything, it pops back into my head. But it’s unsettling. And it happens with simple things, too. Like forgetting what I went into a room for. It's not like… a big memory gone, just… little gaps. Annoying gaps, if you ask me. And I do know what's going on most of the time, it’s just… frustrating.
DOCTOR: I see. So these are more fleeting moments of… difficulty finding words or recalling recent events, rather than larger memory lapses. And it's primarily recent memory, it seems, things you’ve just done or been thinking about?
PATIENT: Precisely. Not like I forget my grandchildren's names or where I live, thank goodness. It's…recent things. Like yesterday, I was telling Mrs. Lason about the tile job I finished, and I completely blanked on the customer's name! Old Man Hem, that’s it! But it took me a good five minutes to get it. Five minutes! I used to remember names like that just…automatically. And it's not like I'm distracted, either. I was focused on the conversation, thinking about the details of the job. It’s just… odd.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Lason. That's very helpful. And it sounds quite frustrating, especially when you're typically so sharp. Now, let's get a bit more of your medical history to help understand what might be going on. Have you experienced anything like this before, or is this a new development?
PATIENT: New. Absolutely new. Never in my life. I’ve always had a good head on my shoulders, always been able to recall things. Even when I was working those long days, hot sun, tiring work…never lost my focus. This started, oh… maybe three, four months ago? Gradually got worse. At first, it was just occasionally misplacing tools, now it's… well, you've heard me. And I haven't hit my head or anything. No falls, no bumps. Just… aging, I suppose. Though I've always thought I was aging pretty well, if you don't mind me saying so.
DOCTOR: No, please, do share! It’s important to understand your baseline. So, no head trauma, and this developed gradually over the last three to four months. Okay. Now, are you experiencing any other symptoms along with these memory lapses?
PATIENT: Hmm…let me think. My wife says I've been… quieter. Less inclined to chat, which is…unusual. I always enjoyed a good conversation, sharing stories. She also says I get irritated easily, little things bother me more than they used to. Not like yelling or anything, just… a shorter fuse, I suppose. And…I don’t know if this is related, but I’ve been feeling a bit…off balance sometimes. Not dizzy, exactly. Just… unsteady on my feet. Especially when I stand up quickly. And, and… this is probably nothing, but I seem to be sleeping more. Like needing an extra hour or two in bed.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s quite a bit of useful information, Mr. Lason. Quieter, shorter fuse, some unsteadiness, and increased sleep. I’m noting all of this. Now, let's talk about your past medical history. Do you have any chronic health conditions, like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, I've been pretty fortunate. Always ate well, worked hard, didn't spend much time sitting around. I had a bit of a problem with my blood pressure a few years back, but it’s been managed with medication for a long time. The doctor, Dr. Phan, he keeps a close eye on it. Says I'm doing well. Other than that…just the usual aches and pains of getting older, you know? Nothing serious. No diabetes, no heart trouble, never been in the hospital for anything major. And I try to stay active, still do some tile work when I can, though not as much as I used to. My wife insists I take it easy.
DOCTOR: Okay, so managed hypertension, with regular follow-up with Dr. Phan. That’s good to know. Now, have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Let me see… There was a hernia operation years ago, probably… oh, 20 years or so. Nothing else. Just the hernia. Simple enough. No complications, recovered quickly. I was back at work in a week. They didn't need to keep me around long. I’m a strong man, you see. Or, was a strong man. Still fairly sturdy, but not like I used to be.
DOCTOR: Alright, no other surgeries. Let's move onto family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – things like Alzheimer's disease, dementia, stroke, or heart disease?
PATIENT: Hmm… now that's a tough one. My mother…she had some problems with her memory towards the end of her life, but we never really knew what it was. Just…old age, they said. She lived to be 92, though. A good long life. My father, he died of a heart attack when he was fairly young, maybe 60s. And my younger brother, he had a stroke a few years back, but he recovered pretty well, thankfully. Other than that…not that I recall. My family wasn't big on talking about health problems, if you know what I mean. Preferred to just…get on with things.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Lason. It’s common for families to not discuss health matters openly. So, some potential memory issues in your mother, heart disease in your father, and a stroke in your brother. Let’s talk about your social history. Do you currently smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Never smoked a day in my life. Disgusting habit, if you ask me. I used to enjoy a glass of wine with dinner occasionally, but I've cut back considerably in the last few years. Just a glass, now and then. And recreational drugs? Heavens, no! I’m a Cambodian man, Doctor. We work hard, we respect our bodies. No need for such nonsense. Always been a teetotaler, really. Just a bit of wine to relax, and not very often.
DOCTOR: Alright, minimal alcohol use. Lastly, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies. Not to food, not to bee stings, not to anything. I've always been pretty lucky that way. Dr. Phan, he’ll confirm it, I’m sure. Always been able to take any medication he prescribes without a problem. Though I prefer to avoid them when I can, if you know what I mean. Pills always have side effects, don't they?
DOCTOR: Yes, many do. Thank you for that comprehensive information, Mr. Lason. It's very helpful. Now, I'd like to do a brief physical examination to get a better understanding of your current condition. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. Do whatever you need to do. I trust your judgment. Just let me know if anything feels… uncomfortable. I'm not a delicate man, but I do prefer a gentle touch. Don't go poking around too much!
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Lason. I will be as gentle as possible. First, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Then I’ll check your blood pressure and pulse. Afterwards, I will perform a brief neurological exam, checking your reflexes, balance, and coordination. Finally, I’ll take a look in your ears, nose, and throat. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear bilaterally. Blood pressure is 148/82. Pulse is 72 and regular. Reflexes are 2+ and symmetrical. Balance is slightly impaired, requiring some support to maintain stability. Coordination is slightly diminished with finger-to-nose testing. Ears are clear, no signs of infection. Nose is clear. Throat appears normal. Okay, Mr. Lason. Your heart and lungs sound good. Your neurological exam is generally normal, but your balance and coordination are slightly diminished. That could be related to the symptoms you’ve been describing. I'd like to order some blood work to rule out any underlying medical conditions. Would you be willing to do that?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. Anything you think is necessary. I trust your professional opinion. Blood work, you say? Is it going to be a lot? I'm not fond of needles, to be honest, though I’ve had my share over the years. And will it take long to get the results? I have a tile job scheduled next week, need to make sure I'm in good shape for that.
DOCTOR: Not a large amount, Mr. Lason. A standard blood panel, including a complete blood count, electrolytes, kidney and liver function tests, thyroid function, and a vitamin B12 level. It's fairly routine. And yes, needles are involved, but the phlebotomist is very skilled, and it should be relatively quick and painless. As for the results, it typically takes 2-3 business days for the lab to process them. We’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them in detail once they are available. In the meantime, I’d also like to recommend a cognitive screening test. It’s a simple, non-invasive assessment that can help us evaluate your memory and thinking skills. It’s not a definitive diagnosis, but it can provide valuable information. Would you be open to taking that test today?
PATIENT: A cognitive test, you say? Hmph. I suppose, if you think it’s necessary. Though I pride myself on my memory, as I’ve told you. Still, I don’t want to refuse assistance if it helps. Is it… complicated? Will I need a pencil and paper? I’m not very good with tests, to be honest. Always preferred practical work to sitting in a classroom. But go ahead, if you insist. Just make it quick, alright? I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Not at all complicated, Mr. Lason. It's a series of simple questions and tasks, like recalling a list of words or drawing a clock. It should take about 10-15 minutes, and we can do it right here in the examination room. No pencils or paper necessary – I will guide you through the entire process. It’s just a tool to help us gather more information. Alright, Mr. Lason. Thank you for your patience. The results of the cognitive screening test show some mild impairment in short-term memory and executive function. This is consistent with the symptoms you’ve been describing, as well as the findings from the neurological exam. Based on the information we’ve gathered today – your medical history, physical examination, and cognitive screening test – I suspect you may be experiencing Mild Cognitive Impairment, or MCI. It’s a condition that can cause subtle changes in memory and thinking skills, but it doesn't necessarily mean you have dementia or Alzheimer’s disease. However, it’s important to rule out other potential causes and monitor your condition closely.
PATIENT: MCI… you mean like… getting old? I knew something was off, but to give it a name… it doesn't sit well with me. I feel fine, mostly. Just a few forgetful moments. Mrs. Lason worries too much. She always said I'd get something, always predicting the worst. But dementia? Alzheimer's? Those are terrible things. You’re sure it’s not… something else? I don't want to spend my days… not knowing who anyone is. My father… he didn't end well. I don't want that. What does this mean for me? And what can we do about it? You said monitor it? Monitor what, exactly?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns completely, Mr. Lason. It is unsettling to hear a diagnosis like MCI, and your fear is perfectly valid. Let me assure you, an MCI diagnosis does not automatically mean you will develop dementia or Alzheimer’s disease. Many people with MCI live full and productive lives for years without experiencing significant decline. “Monitor” in this case means regular check-ups, including cognitive assessments, to track any changes in your memory and thinking skills. We'll also want to address any potential contributing factors, such as high blood pressure, vitamin deficiencies, or sleep problems. To rule out other possible causes, I'd like to order a brain MRI. This imaging test can help us identify any structural abnormalities or other issues that may be contributing to your symptoms. It’s a painless procedure, although it does require lying still for about 30-45 minutes. There are also some lifestyle changes that may help slow the progression of MCI, such as regular exercise, a healthy diet, social engagement, and mental stimulation. I can refer you to a neurologist who specializes in cognitive disorders. They can provide a more comprehensive evaluation and develop a personalized treatment plan. Would you be open to those referrals?
PATIENT: An MRI… lying still for nearly half an hour? That doesn't sound appealing, Doctor. I’m not very good at staying put. But if you insist… alright, fine. I’ll do it, but I want it over with quickly. And a neurologist? Another doctor? This is getting complicated. I already have enough appointments as it is. What will they do that you can’t? More tests, I presume? As for exercise… I try to stay active. Tile work is strenuous, you know. And I eat well, mostly. Mrs. Lason makes sure of that. Though she does try to force too many vegetables on me. So, what’s the best-case scenario here? If this is just MCI… what can I expect? Will I… forget everything eventually? And will it… change me? I don’t want to become a burden to my wife. That's my biggest fear.
DOCTOR: I appreciate your willingness to undergo the MRI, Mr. Lason. It’s a valuable tool, and we’ll do everything we can to make it as comfortable as possible. As for the neurologist, they are specialists in cognitive disorders. They can provide a more in-depth evaluation and develop a tailored treatment plan, including medication options if necessary. They can also monitor your condition closely and provide support and guidance. Now, regarding your concerns about the best-case scenario… Many people with MCI experience only mild and stable symptoms. They can continue to live fulfilling lives, maintaining their independence and enjoying their hobbies and relationships. The progression of MCI is highly variable – some people remain stable for years, while others experience gradual decline. With early detection and appropriate management, including lifestyle changes and, if necessary, medication, we can help slow the progression of MCI and maximize your quality of life. It's important to remember that you are not alone in this, and there are resources available to support you and your wife. I’d like to schedule the MRI for next week. I will also provide you with referrals to a neurologist and a support group for people with cognitive impairment and their caregivers. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Alright, alright. Schedule the MRI, give me the referrals… get it over with. But I’m still skeptical. It all seems… a bit much, honestly. A support group? I don't need pity from strangers. I’m a Cambodian man, Doctor. We handle our problems ourselves. But… perhaps a neurologist isn't a bad idea. Someone to explain things… in simple terms. And maybe, just maybe, they can tell me if this is all… in my head. So, what are the chances… that it is just in my head? That it’s stress, or something else? Mrs. Lason has been worried about me lately… maybe that’s affecting things. And one more thing. If this gets worse… what kind of help will I need? Will I need… someone to take care of me? I don't want to be a burden, like I said. And what about Mrs. Lason? She’s not getting any younger either. This is… a lot to take in.
DOCTOR: It's perfectly understandable to feel overwhelmed, Mr. Lason, and your skepticism is valid. It is a lot to process. You're right, it’s possible that your symptoms are related to stress, anxiety, or other factors. That’s why it's important to rule out all potential causes before arriving at a diagnosis. The neurologist will conduct a thorough evaluation to determine the underlying cause of your symptoms and develop a personalized treatment plan. As for what kind of help you might need if things worsen… that's a difficult question to answer at this stage. It depends on the severity of your symptoms and how quickly they progress. It's possible that you might need assistance with daily tasks, such as cooking, cleaning, or managing medications. You might also benefit from cognitive therapy to help maintain your thinking skills. There are many resources available to support you and Mrs. Lason, including home healthcare services, assisted living facilities, and respite care. We can discuss these options in more detail if necessary. It’s also important to remember that Mrs. Lason is not alone in this. She can benefit from support groups and counseling to help cope with the challenges of caring for someone with cognitive impairment. Let's focus on getting the MRI scheduled and seeing the neurologist. Once we have more information, we can develop a plan to address your concerns and maximize your quality of life. I will also provide you with information about local resources and support groups. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Alright. Do what you have to do. Get the MRI… and the neurologist. I’ll… cooperate. But don't expect me to be happy about it. And… maybe the support groups. For Mrs. Lason, if nothing else. She does worry too much. Just… promise me you won't sugarcoat anything. Tell me straight. If this is serious… I want to know. I’d rather face the truth, however unpleasant, than be led on. I’m a simple man, Doctor. Tile work, family… that’s all I need. Don’t take that away from me. That’s all I ask.
DOCTOR: I promise you, Mr. Lason. I will always be honest and straightforward with you, even when the truth is difficult to hear. You deserve nothing less. I understand that tile work and family are the most important things in your life, and I will do everything I can to help you maintain those connections. I've scheduled the MRI for next Tuesday at 9:00 AM. The radiology department will contact you with instructions on how to prepare. I’ve also provided referrals to two neurologists in the area – Dr. Chen and Dr. Ramirez. They both specialize in cognitive disorders and have excellent reputations. I will also give you information about local support groups for people with cognitive impairment and their caregivers. We’ll schedule a follow-up appointment for two weeks from now to discuss the results of the MRI and your consultation with the neurologist. In the meantime, please don’t hesitate to contact my office if you have any questions or concerns. I know this is a lot to process, Mr. Lason. But you are not alone in this, and I’m here to support you every step of the way.
