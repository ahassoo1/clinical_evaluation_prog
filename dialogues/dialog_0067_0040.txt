DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Espinueva. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Pfennig. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Well, to be frank, it’s my side… my flank, really. It's been giving me trouble on and off for a while now. And then, seems like I get a water infection quite often too. It's a bit bothersome, to say the least.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Flank pain and frequent urinary infections. Let’s talk about both of those. When you say "on and off," about how long has this flank pain been happening in total?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think… on and off… it's been… oh, goodness. I suppose at least a year, maybe a little longer? It comes and goes, you see. Not constant, thankfully. But when it does come, it's a sharp pain, right here… It’s hard to say exactly, because some times it's just a dull ache, and I ignore it, thinking it will pass. But it keeps coming back.
DOCTOR: Okay, a year or so of intermittent flank pain, varying from a sharp pain to a dull ache. And you said it’s on your side – which side specifically?
PATIENT: Mostly my right side, Doctor. Though sometimes I feel it a bit on the left too, but it's much more frequent and worse on the right. It’s… difficult to describe. It's not always in the exact same spot, either. Sometimes higher up, sometimes a little lower. It's a bit all over, really, on that right side.
DOCTOR: Alright, mostly right-sided, intermittent pain for about a year, varying in location and intensity. And you mentioned frequent urinary infections. How often would you say you're getting those?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… it used to be every couple of months, maybe. But lately, it feels like more often. Perhaps every six weeks or so? Sometimes a bit sooner. It's… a nuisance, really. And I don’t particularly enjoy going to the doctor for them, if I'm being honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, so increasing frequency of UTIs, now roughly every six weeks. I understand not wanting to come to the doctor frequently, but it’s good you’re letting me know about this pattern. Now, when you have these UTIs, what symptoms do you experience?
PATIENT: Well, the usual, Doctor. A burning sensation when I… go to the bathroom. And a bit of a… urgency, you see? Like I need to go right now. And sometimes, a bit of discomfort down low. Not always, but when it’s bad, definitely. And the water… it's often cloudy, if you understand what I mean. Not a pleasant topic, I know.
DOCTOR: No, not at all. Thank you for being so open with me. Burning with urination, urgency, some lower discomfort, and cloudy urine—those are all typical UTI symptoms. Now, have you had a fever or chills with any of these infections?
PATIENT: Hmm… a fever, now that you mention it… I don't recall ever having a high fever. Perhaps a little warm, sometimes, but nothing that made me feel really unwell. And chills… not that I remember, no. I usually just feel a bit tired and… achy, generally. Nothing drastic. It’s hard to recall exactly with each one, you see. They all blur together a bit.
DOCTOR: Okay, no high fever or chills, just some tiredness and achiness. And the infections are blurring together a bit in your memory. That's perfectly understandable. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any other medical conditions – diabetes, high blood pressure, kidney problems, anything like that?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, I was told, years ago now, that I have… what was it? Polycystic Kidney Disease. That's what they called it. It was explained to me, but I'm an old man, you see, and things go in one ear and out the other. Something about lots of little cysts on my kidneys. I think that's what causes the trouble, really. I see a specialist for it from time to time, but mostly just get regular check-ups. Is that what this might be related to, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Okay, Polycystic Kidney Disease. That certainly helps explain some things. Thank you for letting me know. And yes, it's very likely related to both the flank pain and the recurrent UTIs. The cysts can cause pain and increase your risk of infection. Do you recall who your specialist is, and when was your last appointment with them?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… his name is… Dr. Patel, I believe. A very nice man. He's at the hospital, the main one in town. And the last appointment… oh dear. That was… some time ago now. Probably a year and a half, maybe two years? It’s been a while. I haven’t been feeling particularly well, so I haven't wanted to bother him with it. I thought it might just be a part of getting older, you see. Perhaps I should have come sooner.
DOCTOR: Okay, Dr. Patel at the hospital, last seen about a year and a half to two years ago. I understand not wanting to bother him, but it's good you're seeing me now. Now, just to get a complete picture, can you tell me about any medications you're currently taking?
PATIENT: Well, let me see… mostly just things for my blood pressure, Doctor. I take… amlodipine, I think it’s called. And… losartan. Yes, those two, every day. And sometimes, when my water infection flares up, I’ll take antibiotics that the doctor prescribes. But I'm not on anything regularly for the kidney trouble itself, if that makes sense. Mostly just those two blood pressure tablets.
DOCTOR: Okay, amlodipine and losartan for blood pressure, and antibiotics as needed for UTIs. And no regular medication for the PKD itself. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not that I know of. I’ve been pretty lucky, thankfully. Never had any reactions to anything, as far as I recall. I can eat most things, and I haven't had any trouble with medications. Though I don't particularly like taking pills, if that counts! But no allergies, no.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Thank you for that information. Now, I'd like to do a brief physical exam, if that's alright. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and I'll also gently feel your abdomen to see if we can pinpoint the source of the flank pain. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly alright. Go right ahead. I’m used to doctors poking and prodding, you see. Just let me know if you feel anything… concerning. I’m happy to help in any way I can.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Espinueva, I’m listening to your heart and lungs now. Everything sounds clear so far. Blood pressure is 142/88. A little elevated, but not drastically so. Now, I’m going to gently feel your abdomen. Does this cause any pain here on the left?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not on the left. Just a bit tender there… But nothing too bad. It’s more when you press here… That’s where it really hurts. It’s a sharp pain when you push, then it sort of radiates around my back a bit. It’s not constant, mind you, just when you press on it.
DOCTOR: Okay, tenderness to palpation in the right flank, with radiation around the back. That’s consistent with what you’ve described. I’m also noting some mild guarding, which means your muscles are tensing up when I press on it. Percussion is normal – no tenderness to percussion. Bowel sounds are present in all four quadrants. Based on this exam, and your history, I suspect your flank pain is related to your Polycystic Kidney Disease, possibly with an associated kidney infection. However, to rule out other possibilities and confirm this, I’d like to order some tests. Would you be agreeable to a urine analysis and a blood test to check your kidney function and look for signs of infection?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds very sensible. I’m happy to do whatever tests you think are necessary. I just want to get to the bottom of this, you see. I trust your judgment. Urine analysis and a blood test… yes, please. Hopefully they will tell us what's going on.
DOCTOR: Okay, excellent. I’ll write the orders for those tests now. The lab is just down the hall, and they'll be able to draw your blood and collect a urine sample. It’s best to drink plenty of fluids before your urine sample, just to make sure we have enough. Once the results are back—usually within a couple of days—we can discuss them and create a plan. In the meantime, I recommend continuing to drink plenty of fluids and avoiding strenuous activity. If you develop a fever, chills, or worsening pain, please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think you’ve explained everything very clearly. Plenty of fluids, avoid strenuous activity, and go to the emergency room if things get worse… I can remember that. Thank you very much for your time and attention. I feel much better just knowing we’re getting this sorted out. I appreciate your kindness. I’ll go and do the tests now.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Espinueva. You’re very welcome. I’m glad I could help. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns. And let’s schedule a follow-up appointment for a few days after the test results come back, so we can discuss them in detail. You take care now. And please remember, if you develop a fever, chills, or worsening pain, go to the emergency room right away. Have a good day.
