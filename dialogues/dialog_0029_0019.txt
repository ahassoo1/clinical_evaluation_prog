DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Carlotta. I'm Dr. Chora. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Hmm... well, my wife and I... we are thinking about... a baby, maybe? She wants one. I think it is good. But we are... older now. I want to make sure everything is okay, you know? For the baby, and for her. I forget things easily, so... maybe you can help us check?
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Carlotta. That's a very thoughtful thing to do, getting things checked out before trying to start a family, especially considering your age and your concern about memory. We want to make sure everything is as healthy as possible. So, to start, let's talk a little bit about your current health. Have you been seeing a regular doctor recently?
PATIENT: Yes, I have a doctor. But… not very often. Maybe… last year? For a check-up. I mostly stay busy with my work. I make little things, you know? Metal and plastic. Not much trouble with my health, usually. Just… getting old, I think. My bones sometimes ache. Is that important?
DOCTOR: Okay. And do you have any specific health concerns right now besides the aches?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No, not really. I get tired sometimes, but everyone gets tired, yes? My wife says I snore very loud, but that is not my problem, is it? I eat okay, I think. She cooks good food. I try to walk a little bit every day, but… sometimes I forget. What kind of things are you looking for, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Well, we want to make sure you're generally healthy enough for the stresses of potential parenthood, and that there aren't any underlying issues that could affect your ability to conceive or the health of a baby. We also want to rule out anything that might be contributing to your forgetfulness. Now, regarding the snoring... sometimes loud snoring can be a sign of something called sleep apnea, which can affect your health. Do you feel tired even after getting what you think is enough sleep?
PATIENT: Sleep apnea? I don't know what that is. Tired… yes, sometimes. But I always feel a little tired. It is just… old age, maybe? My wife says I stop breathing sometimes when I sleep. She shakes me to wake me up. Is that… bad? I do not remember feeling more tired than usual. Just… always a little bit. I am sorry I forget things so easily.
DOCTOR: Okay. That's important information, Mr. Carlotta. Your wife's observation about you stopping breathing is definitely something we need to look into further. Sleep apnea can cause daytime fatigue, and it's also linked to other health problems. Let's move on to some other questions, just to get a clearer picture. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, heart problems, or anything else?
PATIENT: High blood pressure… I think the doctor told me that once, a long time ago. But it went down, I think. He gave me some pills. I do not take them anymore. Diabetes? No, I do not think so. My wife would know. She is good with remembering things like that. Heart problems… no. I walk and work with my hands. I feel okay. It has been a long time since I was very sick. But I am not so young anymore, Doctor. That is what I worry about.
DOCTOR: Alright. We can try to confirm those diagnoses with your previous medical records. Just to be thorough, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. When I was a boy, I broke my arm. A long time ago, in Somalia. They fixed it. And… when I came to this country, I had to have some shots, but that is not a surgery, is it? I was in the hospital for a few days when my wife was born, but that was just to visit her. Nothing serious, you understand. I mostly stay healthy. It is just… getting older, and I want to be sure we can have a healthy baby. Is that okay to ask?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Carlotta, that’s a perfectly reasonable thing to ask. And we’ll do everything we can to help you figure that out. Now, let’s talk about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, diabetes, cancer, or any other serious illnesses?
PATIENT: Family history… hmm. That is difficult. My family… in Somalia, many people died young, from… sickness. But I do not know what kind of sickness. It was a long time ago, and we did not have doctors like here. My mother… she had some trouble with her heart, I think. But she died a long time ago. My father… he was strong. He worked very hard. I do not remember any big sicknesses in his family. It is hard to remember, you understand. Everything is so far away now.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Carlotta. It’s difficult to recall family history when it’s so distant. Let's move on to something a bit different. Do you currently take any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I do not take any pills. Not anymore. I used to take something for my blood pressure, but the doctor said I did not need it anymore. I drink tea sometimes, and my wife gives me vitamins, but that is all. She says it is good for me. But I do not remember what kind of vitamins. Just… little pills. Nothing serious, you understand?
DOCTOR: Okay. And do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I do not think so. I eat many different things. My wife cooks all kinds of food. Sometimes my nose gets a little stuffy, but that is just the dust, I think. I do not get sick from food, or pills, or anything. I am lucky, maybe? I do not remember being allergic to anything. But I am getting old, so maybe my allergies are gone? It is hard to remember, you understand.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Carlotta. To get a better sense of your overall health, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. Just a basic check of your heart, lungs, blood pressure, and a few other things. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That is okay. Whatever you need to do. I trust you. I just want to make sure everything is alright. For the baby, and for my wife. I am a little nervous, but I am ready. Lead the way.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you could please step on the scale for me, we’ll start with your weight. Alright, your weight is 96 kilograms, and your height is 164 centimeters. Your blood pressure is 140/90, which is a little elevated, and your pulse is 78. Your respiratory rate is 16, and your temperature is 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit. Your heart sounds are regular, but I do detect a slight murmur. Your lungs are clear, but there’s some mild wheezing. Your abdomen is soft, and I don't feel any tenderness or masses. Your reflexes are normal. Overall, your physical exam is relatively normal, but the elevated blood pressure and slight heart murmur warrant further investigation. We'll need to do some blood work and potentially an EKG to get a clearer picture.
PATIENT: Blood work? EKG? What are those? Is something wrong, Doctor? My blood pressure is high? I do not feel sick. I just want to make sure we can have a healthy baby. Is that still possible?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Carlotta, let's take things one step at a time. Blood work is just a simple test where we take a small sample of your blood to check things like your cholesterol, blood sugar, and kidney function. It helps us see how your body is functioning overall. An EKG, or electrocardiogram, is a test that measures the electrical activity of your heart. It can help us identify any potential heart problems. Your blood pressure is a little higher than we'd like, but it doesn’t necessarily mean there’s something seriously wrong. It could be due to stress, or other factors. That's why we want to do these tests to get a better understanding of what’s going on. And as for having a healthy baby… it’s still absolutely possible. We just need to make sure you’re in the best possible health before trying to conceive. The tests will help us determine if we need to make any adjustments to your lifestyle or medications. Do you have any questions about the tests themselves?
PATIENT: Tests… okay. I do not like tests, but if you think it is important… yes, I will do them. What about the… the snoring? My wife says I stop breathing. Is that related to the blood pressure, or the heart? And… will the tests hurt? I am a little afraid, Doctor. I just want to be sure everything is okay for the baby.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Carlotta. It's perfectly normal to be anxious about tests. They shouldn't hurt at all. The blood work will just be a quick prick of a needle, and the EKG involves placing some sticky pads on your chest to measure your heart's electrical activity. It’s completely painless. And yes, the snoring – what your wife describes – is likely related to something called sleep apnea, which can often be linked to high blood pressure and heart problems. Sleep apnea happens when you stop breathing for short periods during sleep. It can put a strain on your heart and affect your blood pressure. It’s good that your wife noticed it, as it's something we need to investigate further. We'll need to do a sleep study to confirm the diagnosis. This involves monitoring your breathing patterns overnight while you sleep. It's usually done at a specialized sleep center. For now, let’s focus on getting the blood work and EKG done. Once we have the results, we can discuss the next steps, including the sleep study, and determine the best course of action for you and your wife. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Sleep study… overnight? I do not like that. But… if it is important for the baby… yes. I will do it. I just… I am a little scared, Doctor. I am an old man. Maybe my body is not so strong anymore. Will it take long to get the results from the tests? And… will it be expensive? I have Medicare, but…
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns completely, Mr. Carlotta. It's perfectly normal to feel anxious about these things. The sleep study is usually done in a comfortable setting, and there will be technicians monitoring you throughout the night to ensure your safety. It's not as scary as it sounds. The blood work results usually come back within a few days, and the EKG results are available almost immediately. The sleep study results may take a bit longer, perhaps a week or so, as they need to be reviewed by a specialist. As for the cost, Medicare should cover most of the costs for the blood work, EKG, and sleep study, but there may be some out-of-pocket expenses depending on your plan. We have a billing department that can help you understand your coverage and any potential costs. They can also work with you on a payment plan if needed. Let's focus on getting the tests scheduled first. I'll write you a referral for the blood work and EKG, and I'll give you the contact information for the sleep center. We'll take things one step at a time, and I'll be here to guide you through the process every step of the way. Does that sound like a plan?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… good. One step at a time. I trust you. I just… I want to be a good father. For my wife. And for the baby. Please, just help me make sure everything is alright. Write me the papers for the tests. And the number for the sleep place. Thank you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Carlotta. That's my job, and I'm happy to help. Here are the referrals and the sleep center’s number. Don’t hesitate to call my office if you have any questions or concerns, before or after the tests. We'll discuss the results as soon as they’re available and create a plan that works for you and your wife. We'll get through this together, Mr. Carlotta. And I wish you and your wife all the best. .
