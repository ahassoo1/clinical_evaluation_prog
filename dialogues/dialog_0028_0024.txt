DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Sayar. I'm Dr. Memmolo. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Right. Well, thank you, Doctor. It’s… a bit of an odd request, actually. I need a letter confirming I’m able to fly. My insurance, Medicare, is asking for one before they’ll cover a trip to visit family. It’s a long story, but essentially they want to be sure I'm healthy enough for it.
DOCTOR: A letter… for flying. Yes. Well, Medicare and their… requirements. I suppose it's not entirely unreasonable. Though usually, this sort of thing is handled by your primary care physician. Are you established with someone regularly?
PATIENT: No, I’m not. My husband… he always took care of all that. He passed away last year, and… honestly, I haven’t really gotten around to finding a new doctor yet. I just figured since you're a general practitioner, maybe you could help with this letter? It's just a formality, I think. I’m fairly healthy, all things considered.
DOCTOR: “Fairly healthy.” Right. Well, "fairly" is subjective, isn’t it?
PATIENT: Yes, it is. I mean, I don’t have any major conditions. No heart problems, no lung issues, nothing like that. I exercise when I can, and I eat reasonably well. I had a check-up about five years ago, and everything was normal then, though I understand that doesn't mean much now. I just… I really need this letter to be able to travel and see my sister. It’s important.
DOCTOR: Five years is… a considerable amount of time, Ms. Sayar. We really should establish a baseline, even for a simple letter. I suppose we can do a quick assessment. Just to be thorough. Let’s start with your current symptoms. Anything at all bothering you – fatigue, shortness of breath, chest pain, dizziness?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. Truly. I feel… normal. Maybe a little tired sometimes, but who isn't? That's just life, I think. No dizziness, no chest pain, and my breathing is fine. I walk up the stairs just fine, no problems. I really don’t think there’s anything medically concerning. Can we just… fill out the form? I have a copy of what Medicare needs, if that helps.
DOCTOR: “Think” is the operative word, isn't it?
PATIENT: Look, Doctor, I understand you need to be thorough. But I'm telling you, I feel fine. I'm not trying to deceive anyone, I just… I don't enjoy going to doctors. My husband handled all this, and it's been difficult adjusting. Is there a standard form you use for these travel clearances? If so, I can try to answer the questions as accurately as possible. Perhaps that will be sufficient?
DOCTOR: Very well. I suppose we can attempt that route, though I still maintain a basic examination is… prudent. Let's start with your past medical history. Have you ever been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No, never. Not even as a child. I've always been very lucky with my health. Just the usual childhood illnesses, nothing serious. I broke my arm once when I was little, but that's it. No surgeries, no chronic conditions, nothing. I really do think I'm a very healthy person. I wouldn’t be trying to fly if I wasn’t, you know? I just need this letter.
DOCTOR: Alright. Past surgical history… none. Good. Now, family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think. My mother had high blood pressure, I believe. And my grandfather… on my father’s side, he had diabetes. But that was a long time ago. No heart disease, no cancer, nothing like that that I'm aware of. My sister is perfectly healthy, too. We’ve always been a pretty healthy family, all things considered. It’s another reason I don’t understand why Medicare is being so difficult.
DOCTOR: Social history. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: No, never. My husband smoked, but I always made him go outside. I’ve never touched a cigarette in my life. I do enjoy a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, but nothing excessive. Just one or two glasses, maybe three on special occasions. I wouldn’t say I drink heavily at all.
DOCTOR: And how often would you say "sometimes" is, Ms. Sayar?
PATIENT: Oh, Doctor. Really? Most nights, with dinner. Sometimes I skip a night or two, but generally, yes, most nights I have a glass of wine. It helps me relax. It's not a problem, I assure you. I'm not an alcoholic. I’m just being honest. It’s a habit, more than anything. A small one. Is this relevant to being able to fly? I thought we were doing this for a travel clearance?
DOCTOR: It could be relevant. Alright. Last question for the history portion. Any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, none that I know of. I haven’t taken any medication regularly in years. I took some over-the-counter pain relievers for a headache a few times, but nothing serious. No allergic reactions, no rashes, no breathing problems. I'm very careful about what I put into my body. I really don't think there's anything medically significant I'm forgetting. Honestly, I feel like I'm being interrogated. Can we please just get to the letter?
DOCTOR: Very well. Since you insist you are in perfect health... and despite my professional reservations... we will proceed. I'm going to quickly auscultate your lungs and listen to your heart. Just to confirm what you are telling me. Do not tell me you’re short of breath if you are. I simply wish to hear what is happening. Is that understood?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Perfectly understood. Just… please hurry. I have a lot to do today. And yes, please. Hurry. I am perfectly capable of sitting still, and I assure you, I am not short of breath. Let’s just get this over with.
DOCTOR: Lungs are clear bilaterally. Heart sounds… regular. Alright. Blood pressure is 130/80. Pulse is 72. Seems… adequate. Now, let me see that form.
PATIENT: Here. It’s all the information they need, I believe. Just a statement confirming I’m able to travel. I’ve filled it out as accurately as possible. Honestly, I’m surprised it's taken this long for something so simple. I’m really grateful for your time, Doctor. I hope you can approve it quickly. I’m eager to visit my sister.
DOCTOR: There. Consider it… provisionally approved. I’m signing off stating you appear fit for travel. But, given your limited medical history and my… concerns, I strongly recommend you establish care with a primary care physician immediately. Is there anything else?
PATIENT: No. No, that’s all. Thank you so much, Doctor Memmolo. I really appreciate your help. And… I will consider finding a primary care physician. Thank you again. Have a good day. .
DOCTOR: You too. .
