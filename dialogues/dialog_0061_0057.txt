DOCTOR: Vinaka vakalevu, Chellsea. It’s lovely to meet you. I’m Dr. Kimm. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: It is very kind of you to say so, Doctor. Well, it’s… it’s about the cancer. I was told to come speak with you about it. I don’t really know where to start.
DOCTOR: Okay, Chellsea. That’s perfectly alright. It’s completely understandable to feel overwhelmed. We'll take it one step at a time. I see here you were recently diagnosed with cancer. Can you tell me a little bit about what the doctor who diagnosed you told you?
PATIENT: Um… okay. It was Doctor… Miller. He said it was… in my chest. Something about a growth. He said I needed to see someone for… treatment, and my insurance said to come here. I’m sorry, I don’t remember much else. It was a lot to take in, and honestly, I was mostly just… scared. He didn't explain things very well, I don’t think.
DOCTOR: That’s completely understandable, Chellsea. It is a lot to process, and it’s okay not to remember everything. Dr. Miller, okay. So, a growth in your chest… do you know what kind of growth he suspected, or what part of your chest it was in?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think he said what kind. He just said “growth.” And it was… I think on the left side. Not too far in, but… I don’t know anatomy very well. He pointed, but I mostly remember being worried about my husband at the time. He was sick too, you see. I wasn't really listening, I guess.
DOCTOR: Okay, left side of the chest. And you were understandably preoccupied with your husband’s health. That makes perfect sense. It's easy to miss things when you have a lot on your mind. To get a better picture of what’s going on, can you tell me about any symptoms you've been experiencing?
PATIENT: Well… it hasn’t really felt like anything, to be honest. No pain, not really. Maybe a little tired sometimes, but I thought that was just… everything. And I’ve lost a little weight, but… I haven’t been eating much lately, either. It’s hard to explain.
DOCTOR: Okay, no pain, some fatigue, and unintentional weight loss. And the weight loss… roughly how much weight have you lost, and over what period of time?
PATIENT: Oh, um… let me think. Maybe… ten pounds? Over the last couple of months, I think. It’s hard to say exactly. I don't weigh myself often. And it’s not like I’ve been trying to lose weight. I just… don’t have much of an appetite.
DOCTOR: Okay, about ten pounds over the last couple of months. And you haven’t been actively trying to lose weight. Has anything else changed recently?
PATIENT: Not really. I mean… my husband passed away a few months ago. That was… a big change. Everything feels different now. I’ve just been trying to… get by.
DOCTOR: I am so very sorry for your loss, Chellsea. That is a tremendous change, and it’s understandable that you’re focusing on getting through each day. It sounds like you've been through a lot recently. Let’s shift gears a bit. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. It was… sudden. No, I don’t think I have any allergies. I can eat anything, and I haven’t ever had a reaction to any medicine. I don't take anything regularly, either. Just… what the doctor gives me when I’m sick.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies and no regular medications. That’s good to know. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and feel around in your chest area. Just to get a better sense of things. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that is perfectly alright. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. I just… want to know what’s going on. I’m a little nervous, but… I trust you.
DOCTOR: Vinaka, Chellsea. Thank you for trusting me. Okay, deep breath in… and out… excellent. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear, but I’m going to palpate your chest now, just to feel for any abnormalities. Do you feel any tenderness here?
PATIENT: No, that doesn’t hurt. It doesn’t feel… different, either. Just… your hand. I don’t really feel anything unusual. It just feels like… being touched.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. No tenderness. I’m going to check your lymph nodes as well, just to see if there’s any swelling. Again, just let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. I don’t feel any noticeable swelling in your neck or armpits, but I’ll check your groin now.
PATIENT: No, those don’t hurt either. Nothing feels… off. I don’t think I’ve ever had anything wrong with my lymph nodes before. I used to get sick a lot as a kid, but… not lately. I don’t feel any lumps or anything.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. No palpable swelling in your groin either. Alright, Chellsea, thank you for letting me examine you. Based on what you’ve told me and the exam, it sounds like there's something going on in your chest that needs further investigation. Given your recent diagnosis from Dr. Miller, we need to figure out what kind of growth it is, and whether it has spread. I’d like to order a chest X-ray and a CT scan. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. An X-ray and a… CT scan. Okay. Will those tell you what kind of growth it is? And… will they hurt?
DOCTOR: Yes, those scans will give us a much clearer picture of the growth. The CT scan will give us a detailed look at the size, shape, and location of the growth, and help us see if it’s spread to other areas. The X-ray will give us a general overview. As for pain, the X-ray doesn’t involve any pain at all. The CT scan involves a small amount of radiation, but it's a very low dose, and the scan itself is painless. You'll just lie on a table while the machine takes pictures. We'll also need to do some blood work to get a better understanding of your overall health. Would you like me to explain anything further about these tests?
PATIENT: No, that sounds… alright. No pain. That’s good. Blood work is fine too. I don’t mind. So, the CT scan will… take pictures? Of the inside of my chest? Will I have to… drink anything special for it? Or hold still?
DOCTOR: Yes, exactly. The CT scan will take detailed pictures of the inside of your chest. You won't need to drink anything special for it, but it’s very important that you hold very still while the machine is taking the pictures. The whole process usually takes about 15-20 minutes. We’ll schedule those tests for you right away, and then we’ll review the results together. In the meantime, if you experience any new symptoms, such as shortness of breath, persistent cough, or chest pain, please contact the clinic immediately. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… very good. Fifteen minutes. I can hold still for fifteen minutes. And I will call if anything changes. Thank you, Doctor. You've explained everything very clearly. I feel… a little less scared now.
DOCTOR: I'm glad to hear that, Chellsea. That’s my goal – to make sure you understand everything that’s going on, and to help you feel as comfortable as possible. I’ll have my nurse schedule the X-ray and CT scan for you right away. We’ll get those results back within a few days, and then we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. Here’s a pamphlet with some information about cancer and our clinic resources. Do you have any questions for me before we finish up?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. Thank you again, Doctor Kimm. You've been very kind. I appreciate you taking the time to explain things so carefully. I'll just… wait for the nurse, then.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Chellsea. It was my pleasure. I’ll let my nurse know you’re ready, and she’ll be in shortly to schedule your tests and answer any other questions you might have. Take care, and please remember, you’re not alone in this. Vinaka vakalevu.
PATIENT: Vinaka vakalevu to you as well, Doctor.
