DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Swaby. I’m Dr. Versace. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s a bit difficult to explain… I’ve been having some trouble with my speech, lately. It just… doesn't feel right. It’s like I’m slurring my words sometimes, and it’s worrying me. I’m not sure when it started, exactly. It comes and goes, you see.
DOCTOR: Slurring speech… comes and goes. Alright. Can you describe when it happens?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s… a tricky one. It doesn’t seem to be tied to anything specific, really. Sometimes it’s worse when I’m tired, I think… but then other times I’ll be perfectly fine even after a long day at work. Work is construction management, by the way. It's… physical. I don’t know if that has anything to do with it. Honestly, I’ve been trying to keep track, but it’s hard to pinpoint a pattern. It just… happens. Do you understand what I mean?
DOCTOR: Construction management… physically demanding. Yes, I understand it’s difficult to pinpoint. So, it’s not consistently linked to fatigue, but sometimes is worse when tired. Has anything else changed recently?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Not that I can recall, no. My husband and I have been… quite settled, really. No big changes at home, no new medications… oh! Actually, now that I mention it, I did bump my head a few weeks back. Just a little one, on a low beam at the site. Didn’t think much of it at the time, felt alright after a few minutes. Could that be it? I don't even remember the exact date… sometime in July, I suppose.
DOCTOR: A head injury… in July. Even a minor one. Alright. And you’ve noticed no other symptoms accompanying this speech issue?
PATIENT: No, not that I’ve noticed. No headaches, dizziness, or anything like that. Just the… the slurring. Sometimes it feels like my tongue is a bit heavy, but that might just be me being silly. I honestly can’t remember if it's gotten worse or not, or if it's just my imagination. I'm really sorry I can't be more helpful! It's just... everything feels a little fuzzy lately. Is Medicare alright with covering this visit, by the way? I wouldn't want there to be any issues with payment.
DOCTOR: Medicare should cover this visit, given the neurological symptom. We’ll confirm with billing, of course. Now, regarding your speech… Let’s do a quick neurological exam, shall we?
PATIENT: Alright, that sounds sensible. A neurological exam. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgement. Just… please don't mind if I stumble over my words a bit during it. It's a bit embarrassing, but I'm trying to stay calm. Where do we begin?
DOCTOR: Very well. First, I’ll check your cranial nerves. Follow the light with your eyes – don’t blink – and look left, right, up, and down.
PATIENT: Alright, I can do that. Left… right… up… down… Is this alright? I hope I'm not making a mess of it. It feels a little strange concentrating on not blinking, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Good, good. Eye movements appear normal. Now, I'm going to ask you to say a few things. Can you tell me what today’s date is?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Today’s date… Hmm. Let me think… It’s… August… the 2nd, I believe? 2025, yes. Though I must confess, I had to really think about that. I’m usually better with dates. My husband usually keeps track of everything.
DOCTOR: August 2nd, 2025. Adequate. Now, can you say “Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers” as quickly as you can, and as clearly as possible?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Peter… Piper… picked a peck of pickled peppers… … Peter… Piper… picked a peck… of… pickled… peppers. Oh dear, that was awful, wasn’t it? I’m terribly sorry. It’s much harder than it sounds. It feels like my tongue is… tripping over itself.
DOCTOR: Yes, there is some dysarthria present. Now, I'd like to check your strength and reflexes. Please extend your arms out to the sides, palms up.
PATIENT: Alright. Like this, Doctor? It feels a bit… wobbly, if I’m honest. I do a lot of lifting at work, you see, so my arms are usually quite strong. But they do feel a little tired today. Is that alright? Should I try to hold them up for longer?
DOCTOR: Yes, hold them as you are able. Adequate strength, reflexes normal. Given your history of a head injury, and the presence of dysarthria, I am concerned about possible neurological involvement. I'm going to order an MRI of your brain to rule out any structural damage. It's the most prudent course of action.
PATIENT: Oh. An MRI? That sounds… rather serious, doesn’t it? Is it… is it something to be worried about? I mean, it was just a little bump on the head. But… an MRI… Will it be covered by Medicare, Doctor? And… what exactly will it be looking for? I appreciate you being thorough, of course, but I'm getting a bit… anxious, to be honest.
DOCTOR: An MRI will provide a detailed image of your brain. It is the most definitive way to determine if there’s any damage from the head injury, or another cause for your symptoms. It doesn't necessarily mean something is wrong, but we need to investigate. Medicare should cover it, but we’ll confirm. We’ll be looking for signs of swelling, bleeding, or other abnormalities. I'm also going to refer you to a neurologist for a formal evaluation. It’s best to have a specialist weigh in. In the meantime, avoid any strenuous activity, and if your symptoms worsen—particularly if you experience headaches, dizziness, vision changes, or weakness—go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I understand. No strenuous activity… watch for worsening symptoms… emergency room if needed… and an MRI and a neurologist. It's… a lot to take in, but I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly. I suppose it's better to be safe than sorry. Would the neurologist be covered by Medicare as well, do you think? I just… I worry about the costs, you see.
