DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Licano. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Vodzak. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Um… well, it’s this tiredness. Just… really tired all the time. It’s been going on for… a while now, I guess. Honestly, I can’t really put a date on it. It just is. It’s… annoying. Can we just get this over with quickly? I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Licano. We’ll do our best to get to the bottom of this as efficiently as possible. “Tired all the time” can mean a lot of different things, though. Could you tell me a little more about how you're tired?
PATIENT: How… well, not like I haven’t slept. I sleep okay, I think. It’s just… when I wake up, I still feel… drained. Like I ran a marathon in my dreams or something. And it doesn’t get better throughout the day. Everything feels like… a lot of effort. Even simple things. I don’t have the energy for… well, anything, really. Is that… helpful? I don't know what else to say.
DOCTOR: Yes, that is helpful, thank you. It sounds like this is more than just a lack of sleep, and that it’s impacting your daily life. When you say it feels like everything is a lot of effort, are there any specific activities that are particularly challenging?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… Everything, really. Even getting dressed sometimes. Cooking is awful. I used to love to cook. Now… forget about it. And… visiting friends. Just the thought of going out and being with people… it’s just… too much. I mostly stay home now. My husband… he would always… Oh. Never mind. It's hard to explain. I just don't feel like doing things anymore.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like this tiredness is really affecting your quality of life, and that's concerning. It's good you're telling me about this. Now, let's try to get a better picture of what might be going on. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the tiredness?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Um… let me think… Sometimes I feel a little achy, like I have a mild flu. Not a fever, just… achy. And… I’ve been forgetting things lately. Small things, mostly. Where I put my keys, what I was going to buy at the store… That sort of thing. Oh! And sometimes I get a little dizzy. Not often, but it happens. It’s all… fuzzy, to be honest. Hard to remember specifics. Is this important?
DOCTOR: Yes, all of that is important information, thank you. The aches, forgetfulness, and occasional dizziness… those are all things we need to consider. Do you find that the dizziness is related to any specific movements, like standing up quickly?
PATIENT: Oh, maybe. I think so, yes. When I stand up too fast sometimes, I feel a little… whooshy. Like everything is spinning for a second. It doesn’t last long, but it’s… unpleasant. I just try to move slowly. It’s easier that way. My husband… he always said I moved too fast. Oh. Sorry. I'm rambling.
DOCTOR: You’re not rambling at all, Ms. Licano. It's helpful for me to hear everything you're experiencing. The dizziness with standing is certainly something to note. Now, let's talk a little about your medical history. Do you have any medical conditions that you've been diagnosed with in the past?
PATIENT: Um… let me think. I had… high blood pressure, I think. Years ago. But I was on medication for it, and I think it was under control. And… arthritis, maybe? In my hands. Not bad, though. Just a little stiffness. I’m not really sure, honestly. It was a long time ago, and I don't remember all the details. My husband always took care of the doctor stuff. He kept all the records. I just… went along. Is that bad?
DOCTOR: It's not bad at all, Ms. Licano. Many people rely on their partners to help manage their healthcare. We'll do our best to get a clear picture of your medical history. Do you remember what medications you were taking for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. No, I really don’t. A little white pill, I think? Maybe two little white pills? It was a long time ago. I just took them every day, like I was supposed to. I don't remember the name. It was… something complicated, I’m sure. My husband… he had a whole system for it. Pill boxes and everything. It’s all… gone now. Can we just skip this part? It’s making my head hurt.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Licano. It’s okay if you don’t remember specific details. We can certainly move on. Let’s talk about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family, that you are aware of?
PATIENT: Um… my mother had… heart problems, I think. And my father… he had something with his memory, when he got older. Like… not being able to remember things. Like me, now. But I don't know what it was called. And my brother… he was always healthy as a horse. Never sick a day in his life. Is that helpful? I'm not very good at this, I'm afraid. It’s all so vague.
DOCTOR: It is helpful, Ms. Licano, and you’re doing just fine. Heart problems and memory issues in your family are important to know. Now, I'd like to ask about your social history. Do you smoke or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Oh, no, never smoked. Not even tried it. And I used to drink a little wine with dinner sometimes, but not anymore. Not since… well, not since my husband passed away. It just doesn't taste good anymore. I mostly drink water now. Boring, I know. Can we hurry this up? I have a… a garden to tend to. When I have the energy, that is. It’s all… a mess right now.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's perfectly okay to want to move things along. Now, just a couple more questions. Do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I've never had a reaction to anything. Not ever. I mean, I might be allergic to something, but I haven’t discovered it yet. I don’t really pay attention to those things. My husband always took care of that too. He’d always ask the doctor, and… well, you know. Is this the last question? I’m really starting to feel tired again.
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Licano, that was the last question. Thank you for your patience and honesty. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical exam, if you don’t mind. It will just involve checking your blood pressure, listening to your heart and lungs, and a quick neurological assessment to check your reflexes and balance. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh. That sounds… tiring. But alright, I suppose. As long as it doesn't take too long. And please be gentle? I bruise easily. My husband… he always said I was a delicate flower. Let's just get it over with. The faster, the better.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Licano. We’ll take it slowly and be as gentle as possible. Your blood pressure is a little elevated today, but that can be common when feeling anxious or stressed. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs with my stethoscope. Just breathe normally. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs sound clear. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes and balance. Could you please sit on the edge of the examination table, and I'll ask you to do a few simple things?
PATIENT: Alright. Anything to get this over with. Just… tell me what to do. And please, be quick about it. My legs are starting to feel wobbly. I feel… faint.
DOCTOR: Okay, just extending your arms like that is fine. You have a very slight tremor, which can be normal, but we'll keep that in mind. Now, could you please stand up slowly, and I'd like to check your balance?
PATIENT: Oh… whoa… I… I don't like this. I feel… really dizzy now. Please… can I sit down? I think I'm going to fall. I know I'm going to fall. This is… awful. I just want to go home.
DOCTOR: Whoa, easy now, Ms. Licano. Yes, absolutely, please sit down. That's perfectly alright. Your blood pressure is a bit higher and you're feeling unsteady. Your blood pressure is quite elevated. And given the dizziness and the tremor, I'm a little concerned. I’m going to order some blood work to check your electrolytes, kidney function, thyroid levels, and a complete blood count. I also want to order an EKG to check your heart rhythm. And just to be safe, I’d like to order a CT scan of your brain to rule out any structural issues. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: A… a CT scan? Is that… serious? What’s wrong with me? I just feel tired! And achy! And forgetful! Now you want to put me in a… a machine? My husband… he always said I worried too much. Oh… I just want to go home. I don’t want any machines. I don't want to know what's wrong. I just want my husband. Please… can I just see a different doctor? This is… too much. .
DOCTOR: Ms. Licano, I understand you're feeling overwhelmed and frightened. It’s okay to be scared. We’re not trying to frighten you further, but given your symptoms – the fatigue, dizziness, forgetfulness, elevated blood pressure, and slight tremor – it’s important to rule out any serious underlying causes. The CT scan is just a precaution, to give us a clearer picture of what’s going on. We won't do anything you’re not comfortable with, but I strongly recommend it to ensure we’re providing you with the best possible care. I’m going to be honest; based on what you've told me, and what I've found during the exam, there are several possibilities we need to investigate. It could be something relatively minor, but it's also important to rule out anything more serious. I think a referral to a neurologist would be a good next step, and they can discuss the CT scan and other tests with you in more detail. Would you like me to arrange that for you?
