DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Stoegbauer. My name is Dr. Lessie Solero, and it's a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. Please, call me Emiliano. Yes, well… it’s my foot. It’s been bothering me for a while now. There’s a sore, a bad one, and it won’t get better. It hurts when I walk, you see.
DOCTOR: Okay, Emiliano. I understand. A sore on your foot that’s been causing you pain when you walk. That certainly sounds uncomfortable. To get a better understanding of what's going on, could you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Yes, uncomfortable is a good word. It’s on the bottom of my foot, near my toes, I think. It started small, like a little cut, maybe from a stone in my slipper. But it just… got bigger. Now it’s red and sometimes it weeps a little. And like I said, walking is hard. I try not to put too much weight on it. It's been like this for maybe… a month? Hard to say exactly, time goes so fast.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Emiliano. A month is helpful to know. So, it started as a small cut, possibly from a stone, on the bottom of your foot near your toes, and has grown, becoming red and sometimes draining. You're avoiding putting weight on it because of the pain. To clarify, when you say “weeps,” does that mean it's actively bleeding, or is it more of a clear or yellowish fluid?
PATIENT: Oh, no, not bleeding, Doctor. Not really. It’s… wet. Like when you have a little scrape and it… you know… oozes a little? A clear fluid, mostly. Sometimes it’s a little yellowish, like weak tea. It's not a lot, but enough to bother my sock. I change my socks often, of course. Don't want any trouble with that.
DOCTOR: Okay, "wet" with a clear or yellowish fluid, like a scrape. And you’re being careful to keep it clean and change your socks frequently – that’s excellent. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms along with the sore?
PATIENT: Hmm… other symptoms… let me think. Well, my legs, sometimes they feel… funny. Not always. Like tingling, maybe. And they get tired easier than they used to. And… oh! My vision is a little blurry sometimes. Just a little, but it’s there. I thought it was just my old eyes getting older, you know? I have trouble seeing things far away now. I've always needed glasses, but it seems worse lately.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Emiliano. That’s helpful information. Tingling and fatigue in your legs, and some blurry vision. We'll need to explore those a little further. Just to be clear, is the blurry vision in both eyes, or just one?
PATIENT: Both eyes, Doctor. Not all the time, but mostly both. And it's not like I can’t see anything, it's just… not as sharp as it used to be. Especially far away. Reading is still okay, mostly. I like to read the newspaper, you know? Keep up with things. But the TV… I have to sit closer now.
DOCTOR: Okay, both eyes experiencing blurry vision, more noticeable with distance. And you’ve noticed you need to sit closer to the television. Thank you. Now, let's talk a bit about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any health conditions, like diabetes, heart problems, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Well, the doctor told me years ago I have… the sugar sickness, they called it. Diabetes. I try to eat right, but it’s hard. And I take the pills he gave me. Every day. Been doing that for a long time now. Other than that… not much. Just old age, I suppose. A little arthritis in my hands, but nothing too bad.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Emiliano. It’s good you're managing your diabetes with medication and diet. And arthritis in your hands – I understand. Do you remember the name of the medication you’re taking for diabetes?
PATIENT: Oh dear… that’s a good question. The name… it escapes me. It's a little white pill, I think. I get it every month from the drugstore. The doctor told me what it was, once, but I don't have a good memory for names anymore. I just know to take one every morning with my breakfast. I can show you the bottle, if that would help? It’s in my bag.
DOCTOR: Yes, please, if you wouldn’t mind, showing me the bottle would be very helpful. While you're looking for that, could you tell me about any surgeries you’ve had in the past?
PATIENT: Here it is. It says… Metformin. That’s the name. And… surgeries… let me think. Years ago, I had my appendix taken out when I was a young man. And I had a cataract in my left eye, they fixed that, a few years back. That’s about it, I think. Nothing else. Mostly just bumps and scrapes over the years, nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Emiliano. Metformin is good to know. And the appendectomy and cataract surgery are noted. Now, regarding your family… are there any medical conditions that run in your family – things like diabetes, heart disease, or cancer?
PATIENT: Hmm… that's a hard one. My mother, she had… the sugar sickness, too. Diabetes. She was sick for a long time before she passed. And my father, he had a bad heart. He passed away when I was young. I don't know much about my grandparents, they lived far away. My sister, she was healthy as a horse, always strong. I don't remember anyone else having anything too bad. It’s been a long time, you see. It’s hard to keep track.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Emiliano. Diabetes and heart disease in your family are important to know. Before we move on, let’s talk about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, no, Doctor. Not me. Never smoked a day in my life. My mother didn't allow it in the house, and I just never started. And no alcohol, not much. Maybe a little sip of wine at Christmas sometimes, but that’s about it. And definitely no… those other things. I'm a simple man, you see? I like my garden, and my family. That's enough for me.
DOCTOR: That’s very good to hear, Emiliano. Now, finally, are you allergic to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I've eaten all sorts of things over the years, and never had a bad reaction. And I’ve taken many pills, from many doctors. Never had any trouble. I sometimes get a little itchy from mosquito bites, but that’s about it. Nothing serious, you see? I’m a pretty simple man, like I said. Don’t have any fancy allergies.
DOCTOR: Alright, Emiliano, thank you for sharing all of that information with me. That gives me a good understanding of your medical background and current health status. Now, I would like to take a look at your foot. If you don't mind, could you please remove your shoe and sock so I can examine it?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. Whatever you need. There you are. Be careful, it's a little tender.
DOCTOR: Okay, Emiliano. I see the sore here on the bottom of your foot, near your toes. It is red and inflamed, and there's some swelling. I also see a small amount of drainage. It looks like the skin is broken, and there’s some exposed tissue. Does this area feel particularly tender when I touch it?
PATIENT: Ouch! Yes, Doctor, that’s it. Very tender there. Like a hot needle, almost. And around it too, a little bit. It’s not just the sore itself, it’s the whole area around it. Hurts when I put any weight on it, of course. That's why I'm walking so slow. It’s been getting worse, you see? Especially in the last week. I tried to ignore it, but it's just too much now.
DOCTOR: I understand, Emiliano. It sounds very painful. And I appreciate you describing the sensation as a hot needle – that helps me understand the nature of the pain. I'm concerned about the possibility of an infection, given the redness, swelling, and drainage. And because you mentioned you have diabetes, that increases your risk of complications from foot wounds. I'd like to check the circulation in your foot and your sensation to make sure that the nerves are functioning properly. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. Circulation… nerves… okay. I trust your judgment. I've always been a little worried about my feet, with the sugar sickness. It's good to check those things, I suppose. Just be gentle, please.
DOCTOR: Alright, Emiliano. I’m checking to see if you can feel the vibration and light touch here. Can you tell me if you feel this when I touch you here?
PATIENT: Hmm… not really, Doctor. I feel… something, maybe. Like a little buzzing, but it’s not sharp. It's not like when you poke me with a pin. It’s… faint. Like a little tickle. And here… no, I don’t feel much at all. Just a little pressure, maybe. It’s hard to explain. My feet feel… numb, sometimes. Like they're wrapped in cotton. It’s been getting worse lately, you see? That's why I worry. It’s hard to tell if I’ve hurt myself, if I can’t feel things properly.
DOCTOR: Thank you for being so honest, Emiliano. That's very helpful. The decreased sensation you're experiencing is concerning. It indicates possible nerve damage, which we call neuropathy. This is a common complication of diabetes. Now, I’m going to check the pulses in your foot to assess the circulation. I’m feeling for a strong pulse here and here. I’m detecting a somewhat weak pulse in your foot. This, combined with the decreased sensation, suggests there may be some reduced blood flow. This is something we need to take seriously.
PATIENT: Oh dear. That doesn’t sound good, Doctor. Weak pulse… reduced blood flow… Is that bad? Will I lose my foot? I’ve heard stories… about people with sugar sickness losing toes and feet. That’s what I worry about, you see? I like to garden, and I need my feet for that.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Emiliano. It’s perfectly natural to be worried when you hear stories like that. However, please don’t panic. We are catching this early, and that's very important. We have many ways to manage your condition and prevent complications. Losing a limb is not inevitable. The weak pulse and reduced sensation are warning signs that we need to be more aggressive in managing your diabetes and taking care of your feet. Right now, it means we need to prevent an infection from worsening. I believe you have a developing foot ulcer with potential for infection, and neuropathy with decreased circulation. I want to order some blood tests to check your blood sugar levels, kidney function, and for signs of infection. I'd also like to get an X-ray of your foot to see if there's any underlying bone infection. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds… sensible. Blood tests, X-ray… whatever you need. I want to get better, you see? I don't want to lose my foot. Just… tell me what I need to do. And… will it hurt? Will the tests hurt?
DOCTOR: Okay, Emiliano. That’s good to hear. The blood tests will involve a small blood sample taken from your arm, and the X-ray is painless. It simply involves standing or sitting while a machine takes an image of your foot. It doesn’t involve any needles or radiation that will harm you. While we’re waiting for the test results, it’s crucial that you stay off your foot as much as possible. Absolutely no walking unless absolutely necessary, and even then, very carefully. I'm going to have the nurse clean and dress the wound. We will need to keep it clean and covered to prevent infection. I’m also going to prescribe you a strong antibiotic to start right away, just in case. I also need to strongly emphasize the importance of checking your feet every single day for any signs of redness, swelling, blisters, or sores. Even a tiny cut can become a big problem. Do you feel comfortable learning how to do a proper foot exam?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I can learn. I want to learn. I promise I will check my feet every day, if you show me how. And I will stay off my foot as much as I can. No walking unless I have to. And the medicine… I will take it, just like you said. I want to get better, you see? I just… worry sometimes. It’s hard to take care of myself, all alone. My wife, she passed away last year. She used to take care of my feet… and everything else.
DOCTOR: I understand, Emiliano. Losing your wife must be incredibly difficult, and it’s perfectly normal to feel overwhelmed when you're used to someone taking care of you. We will work through this together. I will make sure you have all the support you need. Let’s focus on learning how to take care of your feet now. The nurse will be in shortly to clean and dress the wound, and I'll have her show you how to do it. But I’ll also demonstrate now. First, wash your feet with warm water and mild soap. Make sure to dry them thoroughly, especially between your toes. Then, carefully inspect your feet for any cuts, blisters, redness, or swelling. Use a mirror if you have trouble seeing the bottoms of your feet. Look for any unusual changes, even small ones. And most importantly, if you notice anything concerning, contact me immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Wash with warm water, dry well, look for cuts and redness. And use a mirror if I have to. Contact you if I see something wrong. It sounds… doable. But what if I can’t tell if something is wrong? What if it just looks a little different? I’m old, you see. My eyes aren’t what they used to be. And… what if it hurts? Will it always hurt? I worry about the pain… more than anything else.
DOCTOR: That’s a very good question, Emiliano. And it’s important to address your concerns about pain. It's perfectly normal to be unsure about what constitutes a change, especially with decreased vision. That’s why I want you to err on the side of caution. If you’re at all concerned about anything, even if it seems minor, please contact me immediately. Don't hesitate. As for the pain, it’s likely you'll experience some discomfort for a while, especially as the wound heals. The antibiotics should help reduce inflammation and infection, which will lessen the pain. We can also discuss pain management options if the pain becomes unbearable. We have several medications and therapies that can help. For now, let’s focus on keeping the wound clean and protected. We’ll monitor your progress closely, and I will adjust your treatment plan as needed. I also want to refer you to a podiatrist – a foot specialist – for ongoing care. They can provide specialized wound care and help prevent future complications. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. A podiatrist… that sounds good. Anything that will help. Clean and protected… monitor the wound… and someone to look at my feet… That's good. I appreciate you taking the time, you see? You don't know how much this means to me. I guess… I’ll wait for the nurse now? And… the tests? What happens next?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Emiliano. I'm glad I could provide some reassurance. You've taken the first and most important step - seeking help. Yes, the nurse will be in shortly to clean and dress the wound and show you how to do it yourself. She'll also explain the blood tests in more detail. They’ll draw a small sample of blood from your arm, and the results will be available within a few days. I’ll contact you as soon as they’re back to discuss them. The X-ray will be done shortly after the blood tests. It’s a quick and painless procedure. The technician will simply take an image of your foot. Once we have the test results, we’ll have a better understanding of the situation and can develop a more targeted treatment plan. I’ll also schedule an appointment with the podiatrist for you. In the meantime, please remember to stay off your foot as much as possible, keep the wound clean and protected, and contact me if you have any concerns. Do you have any questions for me right now, before the nurse arrives?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think… I think that covers everything. You explained it all very clearly. I’m just… tired now. It’s been a long morning, worrying about my foot. I’ll wait for the nurse. Thank you again, Doctor. You’ve been very kind. I think… I’m ready now. Ready to try and get better. .
DOCTOR: That’s excellent to hear, Emiliano. Rest assured, we’ll do everything we can to help you on your journey to recovery. Don't hesitate to reach out if anything comes to mind. I’ll have the nurse come in right away. Get some rest, and we’ll take things one step at a time. .
