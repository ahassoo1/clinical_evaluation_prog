DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Paske. I'm Dr. Donate. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s this tiredness. Daytime tiredness, mostly. I’ve been using one of those machines at night – a CPAP, I think it’s called – for a while now, and it should be helping, but I’m still dragging myself through the day. It's just… exhausting.
DOCTOR: Hmm. A CPAP, alright. And you've been using it for how long now?
PATIENT: Let me think… It must be… close to two years now. Maybe a little more. The doctor back in the city – before I moved out here – he’s the one who prescribed it. He said I stopped breathing a lot when I was sleeping. Doesn't seem possible, but that’s what he said!
DOCTOR: Right, sleep apnea. And you said it should be helping… so, were you consistently using it when you first got it?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, very consistent at first. I was really good about it. Every night, without fail. I wanted it to work, you know? But… well, habits are hard to keep up, even good ones. There were a few times I forgot it when I traveled, and… honestly? Sometimes it’s just uncomfortable. The mask, mostly. It feels… claustrophobic. I try to use it as much as I can now, but it’s probably not every night. I’d say… four or five nights a week, maybe? It varies.
DOCTOR: Okay. Four or five nights a week. And you’ve noticed the tiredness is worse on the nights you don't use it?
PATIENT: Yes, definitely. It’s a noticeable difference. The next day is just… sluggish. Hard to concentrate, you know? And I feel like I’m nodding off all the time. Even just sitting and reading. It's not dangerous, not yet, but it's… irritating. Especially because I like to keep busy. I still teach a class at the community college, you see, and it's hard to be sharp when you’re fighting to stay awake.
DOCTOR: Alright. And besides the tiredness, are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. My wife – well, my ex-wife, now – used to complain about my snoring. A lot. But that was before the machine, of course. And… I wake up with a dry mouth sometimes. A little bit of a headache, too, in the mornings. Nothing terrible, just… annoying. And I suppose I get a little bit more irritable than I used to. But honestly, at my age, who isn’t irritable?
DOCTOR: Alright. Dry mouth, occasional headaches, and some irritability. Do you notice any swelling in your legs or ankles?
PATIENT: Swelling? No, not that I’ve noticed. I look at my legs every now and then, just to make sure everything's alright, but they seem normal. I don’t have any trouble with my shoes being tight or anything like that. I do walk a little bit most days, if that makes a difference. Just around the neighborhood, nothing strenuous.
DOCTOR: Okay. And are you having any chest pain, shortness of breath, or palpitations?
PATIENT: Palpitations? No, no chest pain or anything like that. My heart feels… normal. I get a little breathless if I climb a lot of stairs, but that's just getting old, I suppose. I haven’t had any sort of fluttering or anything unusual with my heartbeat, thankfully. I worry about my heart, you know, but it hasn’t been giving me any trouble, at least not that I’ve noticed.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's talk about your medical history. Do you have any other medical conditions that we should be aware of?
PATIENT: Well, let me see… I had high blood pressure for a while, but it’s been under control with medication for years now. And I had my gallbladder removed, oh, must be twenty years ago. Other than that… not much, really. I’ve been pretty lucky, all things considered. No diabetes, no arthritis… just the usual aches and pains of getting old. I try to eat reasonably well, and I don’t smoke. Never have. My mother always warned me about smoking. She was very strict about that.
DOCTOR: Okay, controlled hypertension and a cholecystectomy twenty years ago. And you don’t smoke. What medications are you currently taking, if you don’t mind me asking?
PATIENT: Not a problem at all. Let me see… I take lisinopril for the blood pressure, 20 milligrams every day. And I take a baby aspirin, 81 milligrams, just as a preventative measure. My doctor suggested that a few years back. Oh, and sometimes, if I can't sleep, I take a Tylenol PM. But that's only occasionally. Maybe once or twice a week, if I'm really restless. I have a list here, actually. Let me hand it to you. It’s a bit crumpled, but…
DOCTOR: Alright, thank you. Lisinopril, aspirin, and Tylenol PM as needed. Now, any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, thankfully, no allergies. I’ve never had a reaction to anything, as far as I know. My wife used to try all sorts of new foods on me – she was a bit of a gourmet cook – and I never had any problems. I’m pretty lucky that way. I do get itchy sometimes if I'm out in the garden, but that's probably just the plants. Nothing serious, I assure you.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Now, let's talk about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Let me think… My father had heart trouble, I believe. He had a heart attack when he was in his sixties. And my mother had high blood pressure, like me. My sister… she had some sort of arthritis, I think, but I don't know much about it. She didn’t talk about it much. And that's about it, really. Nothing major that I know of. My family wasn’t much for talking about their ailments, you know? They believed in suffering in silence.
DOCTOR: Right. Heart trouble in your father, hypertension in your mother. And finally, let's talk about your social history. Do you drink alcohol or use tobacco?
PATIENT: No, I don’t drink alcohol. Never really liked it, to be honest. And as I said before, I don't smoke. Never have. I live alone now, since the divorce. I keep busy with my teaching, and I volunteer at the local library a couple of times a week. Mostly shelving books, things like that. I enjoy reading, of course. It’s a good way to pass the time. I have a few friends I see now and then, but nothing regular. Mostly just catch up over coffee.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Paske. So, we’ve covered quite a bit. You’ve been using a CPAP for two years, but not consistently, with continued daytime tiredness. You have controlled hypertension and a cholecystectomy. You're on lisinopril and aspirin. No allergies. Family history of heart trouble and hypertension. And you don’t smoke or drink. Let’s do a quick physical exam. I'd like to check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and take a look in your throat. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly fine, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I’m happy to cooperate. I haven't had a proper check-up in a while, so it’s probably a good idea. Just let me know what you need me to do.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is a little elevated today, 148 over 86. We’ll keep an eye on that. Heart sounds are regular, but there's a slight murmur. Not overly concerning, but something to note. Lungs are clear. Throat looks normal, no significant redness or swelling. No swelling of the thyroid. Alright, Mr. Paske. Everything seems relatively normal, but your blood pressure is a bit high, and there's a slight heart murmur. Given your continued tiredness despite CPAP use, and the elevated blood pressure, I’d like to order a few lab tests. A complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a thyroid-stimulating hormone level. And I’d also like you to have an EKG to evaluate the heart murmur further. How does that sound?
PATIENT: That sounds… thorough, Doctor. Which is good. I appreciate you taking the time to look into everything. Yes, the tests sound fine. An EKG… is that something uncomfortable? I’ve never had one before.
DOCTOR: No, an EKG is very simple and painless, Mr. Paske. We’ll just put some sticky pads on your chest, arms, and legs, and it records the electrical activity of your heart. It doesn't hurt at all. Just lies flat for a few minutes. We can also look at your CPAP data, if you have access to it. That will give us a better understanding of how consistently you are using it. Do you have the data readily available, or do we need to contact your previous doctor for that information?
PATIENT: Yes, I think I can access the data online. The machine came with an app for my phone. I haven’t checked it in a while, to be honest, but I’m pretty sure it’s still there. I can log in when I get home and send you a screenshot, if that’s alright? And sending a screenshot sounds a lot easier than getting my old doctor involved!
DOCTOR: Alright, a screenshot would be perfect. And we’ll get the lab orders sent to the lab right away. Once we have the results, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and determine the best course of action. In the meantime, try to check your blood pressure a couple of times a day, if you can, and record the readings. And while we’re waiting on the results, let's try to improve your CPAP adherence. Even using it a few more nights a week can make a difference. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, I think you’ve covered everything very thoroughly, Doctor. Checking my blood pressure and trying to use the machine more consistently sounds sensible. I’ll do my best. Thank you for taking the time to listen to me, and for not dismissing my tiredness as just "getting old". I appreciate that. I’ll get that screenshot sent over as soon as I can. .
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Paske. You’re very welcome. I’m glad I could help. And don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. Have a good day.
