DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Szmyd. I am Dr. Blim. Now, let’s not waste any time, shall we?
PATIENT: Morning. Blim, you say? Is that… Dominican? Not many Dominicans where I come from. Anyway, yes, yes. I’m here… new to the area, you know? Medicare sent me. Old age, I guess. What do you want to know?
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Szmyd, it is. And while your geographical observations are… noted, I assure you my origin is irrelevant to your medical care. Medicare, of course. Efficient as ever. Let’s begin with why you are here today. Be precise, if you would. I have other patients waiting. What specific complaints have brought you in for an examination?
PATIENT: Complaints? Well, I do feel a bit… old. Is that a complaint? I work with the faces, you know? Makeup. Theatrical things. Makes people look… better. But I feel… not so good, lately. Little aches and pains. Nothing serious, I hope. It’s just… getting harder to see the details. The little lines. Very important lines.
DOCTOR: "A bit old," is not a diagnosis, Mr. Szmyd. And "little aches and pains" is equally unhelpful. Let’s try a structured approach. When did you first notice these “aches and pains?
PATIENT: Structured… Oh, it's been… a while. Months, maybe? Honestly, time gets away from you. It’s all a blur of faces and powder. I think… after the last show. Big production. Lots of glitter. Probably strained something. Back, maybe? Or shoulder. They all hurt, if I think about it too much.
DOCTOR: "A blur of faces and powder" is not a timeframe, Mr. Szmyd. We need specifics. Was there a particular incident during this "big production" that caused the pain?
PATIENT: Incident… Hmm. Not exactly an incident. The costumes were heavy, very elaborate. Lots of lifting. And Svetlana, my assistant… she’s strong, but not careful. She bumped into me a few times. Pushing things around. Didn’t mean to, I’m sure. But it wasn't… gentle. Maybe that? It’s all a bit of a mess in my head.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let's move on from this… anecdotal recollection. You mentioned difficulty with details, specifically "lines." Are you referring to visual impairment?
PATIENT: Impairment… Is that… bad? No, not bad, just… blurry. Like looking through old glass. I used to be able to see everything. Every little wrinkle, every tiny freckle. Now… not so much. Makes my job harder. People pay me for details, you see? It’s important. Very important.
DOCTOR: Right. Blurry vision. And this has been happening… concurrently with these aches and pains?
PATIENT: Yes, I think so. They sort of… came at the same time. The aching and the blurriness. After the show, like I said. I thought it was just tiredness, at first. Old age, you know? But it hasn't gone away. It's just… getting worse, slowly. Maybe I need new glasses? I have a pair, but… they don't seem to be helping much.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let’s review your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any chronic conditions?
PATIENT: Chronic… Hmm. Let me see… I had something, a long time ago. Back in Russia. Something with my… stomach, I think. But it was… fixed. They gave me pills. It was a long time ago. Before I came here. And my blood pressure, maybe? The doctor said it was a little high. But I don’t remember much about it. Old age, you know? Things get… lost.
DOCTOR: "Lost" is not a helpful medical term, Mr. Szmyd. Do you currently take any medications?
PATIENT: Let me see… ah, yes. This. The little white pills. For the… pressure. And something for my… joints, maybe? It’s all a bit of a mess. Svetlana keeps track of it, mostly. She’s good with the details. I take one in the morning, and one at night, I think. Maybe two of the white ones. It’s hard to remember.
DOCTOR: Adequate. Now, any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No, I eat everything. Russian food, American food… I’m not a picky man. I used to be allergic to Svetlana’s cooking, but she improved. No, no allergies. Never had any. Unless… Dust? Maybe. I get a little… sneezy when there’s a lot of glitter. But that’s not an allergy, is it?
DOCTOR: Glitter is… noted. Now, Mr. Szmyd, let’s proceed with a brief physical examination. I need to assess your range of motion, reflexes, and, of course, your vision. Please follow my instructions carefully. If you would, please lie down on the table, face up.
PATIENT: Lie down? Like a sick man? I don't like lying down. Makes me feel… weak. But… alright. If you insist. Just be gentle, alright? My back isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: “Hmm,” “Tenderness here. And here.” “Limited range of motion in the lumbar spine.” “Possible muscle strain, likely exacerbated by repetitive movements and improper lifting technique.” “Tenderness in the rotator cuff. Limited range of motion, but not severely restricted.” “Read the smallest line you can see, please.”
PATIENT: Ow! Careful! Yes, that’s sore. Always sore, really. I told you about the lifting. Svetlana… she’s strong, but… no finesse. Repetitive movements… that's the makeup, you see? All the little strokes. And the shoulders, all the holding of the lights. Let me see… Is that an 'E'? No… maybe a 'P'? Everything’s blurry. I can see the big letters, but the small ones… This is hopeless. My eyes aren’t what they used to be.
DOCTOR: "Visual acuity significantly diminished. Requires further evaluation." “I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs now.” “Heart sounds normal. Lungs clear to auscultation.” “Based on my examination, I suspect a combination of musculoskeletal strain and age-related decline in vision. The pain is likely due to the repetitive movements and improper lifting technique, while the vision loss requires a more comprehensive assessment.” “I’m going to order a complete blood count, a basic metabolic panel, and a referral to an ophthalmologist for a thorough eye exam.”
PATIENT: Blood count? What for? I feel fine, mostly. A little sore, a little blurry… that’s all. And an… ophthalmologist? Is that someone who fixes eyes? I just need new glasses, I think. All these tests… it seems a bit much. I don't like needles. Is there a needle involved?
DOCTOR: "Mr. Szmyd, a complete blood count and basic metabolic panel are standard procedure to rule out any underlying medical conditions that may be contributing to your symptoms. It's… responsible medical practice." "And yes, a blood draw is required. A small one. It's barely noticeable." "Regarding the ophthalmologist, a comprehensive eye exam is essential to determine the extent of your vision loss and identify any underlying pathology. New glasses may alleviate some symptoms, but they will not address the root cause." "I will write you a prescription for the blood tests and a referral to Dr. Evelyn Reed, a highly respected ophthalmologist in the area."
PATIENT: Fine, fine. Blood tests and… that eye doctor. But if it's all just to tell me I need new glasses, I’m blaming you. Dr. Reed, you say? Is she… expensive? Svetlana handles the insurance, but... We're not rich, you know. I just want to feel better. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: “Dr. Reed is a covered provider under Medicare, so your out-of-pocket expenses should be minimal. However, I cannot provide financial advice. You will need to verify coverage with your insurance provider.” “I have ordered the blood tests. The lab is located on the second floor of this building. Please schedule an appointment with Dr. Reed as soon as possible. And Mr. Szmyd, I suggest you consider modifying your lifting technique and taking frequent breaks to prevent further strain.” “Do you have any further questions?
PATIENT: Lifting technique… Easy for you to say. It's a living. No, I don't think so. Just… try not to poke me too hard with the needle. And thank you… I guess. I should probably go find that lab.
