DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Schneer. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Giganti. It’s nice to meet you. Now, can you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good mornin’ to ya, Doctor. Giganti, is it? Nice to meet ya too. Well now… let me see… it’s me ears, I think. They ain’t what they used to be, that’s for sure. Things are just… muffled, ya know? Hard to hear folks talkin’. Not sure exactly when it started, just kinda… happened.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Schneer, I understand. You’re experiencing some muffled hearing in both ears. And you said this came on gradually, without a specific event that triggered it?
PATIENT: Gradually, yes. That sounds right. No big bang or nothin’. Just… less and less clear. My daughter, bless her heart, she's been tellin' me for months I need to get it checked out. She says I turn the TV up too loud. Probably is right, now that I think about it.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful to know. And it sounds like your daughter has noticed it as well. Now, can you tell me if the muffled hearing is constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. I think… mostly constant. Though sometimes, when it’s quiet, it seems a little better. But even then, it’s not like it used to be. I used to hear a pin drop, ya know? Now… not so much. I don’t pay much attention to it, to be honest. Just… livin’ with it, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Alright, mostly constant, with slight improvement in quiet environments. And you mentioned you used to have very sensitive hearing. Now, have you noticed any ringing, buzzing, or hissing in your ears at all?
PATIENT: Ringing… now that you mention it… maybe? It's hard to say. Sometimes I think I hear somethin', but I just figured it was the house settling, ya know? Old house. Lots of creaks and groans. Could be that. Never really paid it much mind. Is that somethin' I should be payin’ mind to?
DOCTOR: It's good you mentioned that, Mr. Schneer. Ringing, buzzing, or hissing – we call that tinnitus – can sometimes accompany hearing loss. It’s certainly something we want to explore. Now, have you ever been exposed to loud noises regularly – perhaps at work, or as a hobby?
PATIENT: Loud noises… well, now, that reminds me. I worked in a shoe factory for… oh, goodness, must’ve been forty years. All them machines, bangin’ and whirrin’ all day long. Wasn’t quiet, that’s for sure. Everyone wore earplugs, but… I don’t know if they did much good. It was a long time ago, though. A long time.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s very important information, Mr. Schneer. Forty years in a shoe factory with exposure to loud machinery. That certainly could be a contributing factor. Now, I'd like to ask a few more general questions. Do you have any history of ear infections?
PATIENT: Ear infections… let me think. I had somethin’ as a little boy, I think. Momma used to put warm oil in ‘em. That's all I really remember. As an adult… not that I recall. Never been one for gettin’ sick much, thankfully. Just… old age settin’ in, I reckon. That's what my daughter says, anyway.
DOCTOR: Alright, so a childhood ear infection, but nothing as an adult. Now, have you ever experienced any dizziness, balance problems, or a feeling of fullness in your ears?
PATIENT: Dizziness… sometimes. Not real bad, just a little unsteady when I stand up too fast. I figured it was just me gettin’ old. Happens to everyone, right? Fullness… hmm… sometimes my ears feel… plugged, I guess. Like when you're flyin' in a plane. But it doesn't last long. Nothing to worry about, I always thought.
DOCTOR: Okay, so occasional dizziness when standing, and a feeling of fullness in your ears sometimes. Now, I'd like to do a quick examination of your ears to get a better idea of what might be going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, sure, Doctor. Whatever ya need to do. I trust your judgment. Just let me know if it's gonna be uncomfortable. Never been one for fancy doctorin', but I suppose it's gotta be done.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I’m just going to take a look inside your ears with this instrument. It won’t hurt, but I might need to wiggle it around a little to get a good view. Alright, the right ear canal appears clear. The eardrum is slightly dull in appearance, but intact. Now, the left ear canal is also clear. The eardrum is similar to the right – slightly dull, but intact. I don’t see any signs of fluid or infection. Based on the examination, there doesn’t appear to be any obvious cause for your hearing loss, like a blockage or infection. However, the dull appearance of your eardrums suggests some fluid may be present. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to perform a quick hearing test – an audiometry – to assess the extent of your hearing loss. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: A hearin' test, huh? Sounds sensible. If ya think it'll help figure things out, then yes, go right ahead. I don't mind a bit of pokin' and proddin' if it gets to the bottom of things. Just tell me what I need to do. I'm an old man, Doctor. I've been through worse.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Alright, Mr. Schneer. We’ll just step into this soundproof booth for the hearing test. You’ll wear a set of headphones, and I’ll play a series of tones at different pitches and volumes. Your job is simply to indicate when you hear a tone – press the button when you hear something and release it when you don’t. It will take about 20-30 minutes. I'll be right outside the booth if you need anything. Are you ready to proceed?
PATIENT: Sounds simple enough. A button, eh? I can manage a button. Twenty to thirty minutes... I can sit still that long. Go ahead, Doctor. Let’s get this done. Just point me to the button, and I'll do me best.
