DOCTOR: Bula and good morning, Mr. Szmyd. I'm Dr. Kimm. It's lovely to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hmph. Good morning to you too. Kimm, you say? Okay. Well… I just moved here, see? New place. Doctor told me I needed to… to get checked out. Social thing, I think. Medicare, they said. Old bones, you know. Not much wrong, probably. Just… visiting.
DOCTOR: Okay, that makes sense. Welcome to the area, then! And thank you for coming in. "Old bones" is a common concern, and it's good you're getting things checked out. Just to be thorough, can you tell me a little more about why your previous doctor recommended a check-up?
PATIENT: Hmph. Previous doctor… that was… back in the city. A nice woman, I think. Everything is… blurry now, you know? She talked about… something with my hands. Said they were getting… stiff. I do makeup, see? For the theater. Lots of little movements. Maybe that’s it. I don't remember exactly why she sent me. Old age, I tell you. Everything gets… lost.
DOCTOR: I understand, things can definitely get lost in memory. So, the stiffness is mainly in your hands, and it’s affecting your ability to do detailed work with makeup for the theater?
PATIENT: Yes! Exactly. Little brushes, tiny things. Harder to hold steady now. Not like before. I used to be very good, you know? Best in the city, some people said. But… now? It’s… frustrating. Makes me slow down. And… sometimes, they ache. Not all the time, just… when I’m working.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. So, stiffness and aching in your hands, specifically when you're doing fine motor work like makeup application. And you've noticed this getting worse over time?
PATIENT: Worse? Hmph. Maybe. It’s… gradual, you know? Like a slow leak. Didn't happen all at once. One day, a little harder. Next day, a little ache. Now… I notice it more. I have to… concentrate harder. And sometimes… I drop things. Brushes, little pots of color. Very annoying. Makes a mess.
DOCTOR: Okay, that sounds like a gradual onset of symptoms. And it's affecting your ability to do your work, which is understandably frustrating. Besides your hands, have you noticed any stiffness or aching in any other joints – like your wrists, elbows, shoulders, knees, or ankles?
PATIENT: Hmph. Let me think… Wrists, maybe a little. Not like the hands, just… when I’m bending them a certain way. Knees, sometimes. Old knees. Always creaky, though. That’s just… age. Shoulders… no, not really. Elbows… no. Mostly just the hands and a little in the wrists. The knees are always complaining. I don’t pay them much attention.
DOCTOR: Okay, so primarily hands and wrists, with some occasional knee discomfort that you attribute to age. Have you noticed any swelling in your hands or wrists, or any redness or warmth?
PATIENT: Swelling? Hmph. Sometimes, maybe. Hard to tell. They look… normal, mostly. Old hands are puffy, you know? Never been much of a redness person. No warmth, no. They just… ache. And get tired. Working with little brushes all day… very tiring. I used to be able to do it for hours. Now… I need breaks.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no significant redness or warmth, mainly aching and fatigue in your hands. Do you have any other medical conditions that you're aware of, like diabetes, high blood pressure, or arthritis?
PATIENT: Arthritis? The doctor back in the city… she might have said something about that. Something ending in '-itis'. But… I forget. Old age, you know. High blood pressure… maybe? They gave me pills, once. But I stopped taking them. Made me feel… funny. Diabetes… no, I don't think so. I like sweets, but… no diabetes. Just old bones and tired hands.
DOCTOR: Okay, a possible mention of arthritis previously, and a history of being on medication for high blood pressure, which you discontinued due to side effects. Do you recall what those side effects were?
PATIENT: Hmph. Side effects… dizzy, I think. And… tired. Even more tired. Not good when you have to work with little brushes. Everything needs to be steady, you know? So, I stopped taking the pills. Doctor didn't seem to mind too much. Said I could… monitor it myself. Which I did. Mostly by… avoiding sweets. A little.
DOCTOR: Okay, dizziness and increased fatigue from the blood pressure medication, leading you to discontinue it and monitor things on your own with some dietary adjustments. That's good to know. Now, are you currently taking any medications at all, even over-the-counter ones like pain relievers or vitamins?
PATIENT: Hmph. Vitamins, yes. Old lady gave me some. Said it was good for the joints. Something with… glucosamine? Chondroitin? Something like that. A big bottle of pills. And sometimes, when the hands really ache, I take… ibuprofen. The little white ones. Not very often, though. Just when I need to work and can’t… concentrate.
DOCTOR: Okay, you're taking a glucosamine/chondroitin supplement and ibuprofen as needed for hand pain. And, just to complete the picture, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmph. Allergies? No, not really. I eat everything. I used to be… sensitive to dust. But that was when I was younger, working in the theater. Lots of old costumes, lots of dust. Now… I don’t notice it much. No medications, no foods… nothing. I’m a very… robust person. Old, but robust.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. That’s good. Alright, Mr. Szmyd, thanks for all that information. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam of your hands and wrists, just to get a better sense of what’s going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Hmph. Exam, you say? Fine. Get it over with. I have things to do, you know? Makeup doesn't apply itself. Just… be gentle. Old hands.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, I will be very gentle. Okay, I'm just looking at your hands now. I notice some mild swelling in the knuckles of both hands, and a few bony prominences. There’s some tenderness when I press here, on the back of your hands. And when I ask you to bend and straighten your fingers and wrists… there’s a slight limitation in the range of motion, particularly with bending your knuckles. It’s not severe, but it’s noticeable. I’m also checking your grip strength… which is slightly weaker than expected for your age. Now, do you feel any pain with any of these movements?
PATIENT: Hmph. Pain… yes, a little. When you bend them like that. A dull ache. Not sharp. Just… uncomfortable. And yes, a little when you squeeze. Not much. I used to have a very strong grip. Held everything steady. Now… it’s not the same. Old age, you know? Everything gets… weaker. And the knuckles… yes, they ache when it's cold.
DOCTOR: Okay, dull ache with bending and gripping, and increased discomfort in the knuckles with cold temperatures. I'm also checking the skin on your hands… everything appears normal, no redness or rashes. Alright, Mr. Szmyd, based on what you've told me and what I've found on the exam, it sounds like you may be experiencing early signs of osteoarthritis in your hands. It's a common condition, especially as we get older, and it involves the breakdown of cartilage in the joints, leading to pain, stiffness, and decreased range of motion. It’s good that you came in to get it checked out now, as we can start managing the symptoms and slowing down the progression. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Hmph. Osteo… what-itis? Sounds… complicated. Old age, you say? Just old age? I figured as much. Not much you can do about old age, is there? And… manage the symptoms? What does that mean? Pills? More vitamins? I don’t want to be… drugged up. I need steady hands.
DOCTOR: You're right, it is often a part of getting older. "Osteoarthritis" just means "joint inflammation." And you're also right to be cautious about medications. We don't necessarily need to "drug you up" at all. Managing the symptoms means a few different things. We can start with some simple things like hand exercises to help maintain your range of motion and strength, and over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen when you have discomfort. There are also topical creams you can use directly on your hands. We can also discuss adjusting your activities to avoid putting too much stress on your joints. The glucosamine/chondroitin supplement you're already taking might be helpful, although the evidence is mixed. I'd like to order some X-rays of your hands just to get a better look at the joints and confirm the diagnosis. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Hmph. Exercises… I suppose. Can’t hurt, I guess. And cream… better than pills. Topical, you say? Fine. Adjusting activities… that’s harder. Makeup doesn’t make itself, you know? X-rays… more poking and prodding? Fine. Get it over with. Just… be quick about it. And no funny business. I’ve seen enough doctors in my life.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, I understand. We’ll make it as quick and comfortable as possible. No funny business, I promise. Okay, I’m ordering the X-rays now. The technician will call you when they’re ready. In the meantime, I'm going to print out some information about hand exercises and topical creams, and a handout on osteoarthritis. We can also talk about some strategies for protecting your joints while you're working. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: Hmph. Questions… not really. Just… how long will this all take? X-rays, exercises, hand cream… I have a show next month. Need my hands steady. And… will this mess with my makeup? Can’t have flaky skin, you know. Very important.
DOCTOR: Those are very important questions! The X-rays should only take about 15-20 minutes. As for the exercises, they’re gentle and should take about 10-15 minutes a day. We’re aiming to improve your hand function, not worsen it. And the topical creams are designed to be absorbed into the skin and shouldn’t cause flaking. I recommend starting with a small amount to test it out. We'll review the X-ray results together when they're back, and we can adjust the plan if needed. If you do notice any irritation or flaking from the cream, stop using it and let me know. I also want to emphasize that we're starting this early, so we can manage the symptoms and hopefully prevent them from interfering with your work. Do you have any concerns about missing rehearsals or performances?
PATIENT: Hmph. Rehearsals… yes, a little. I’m the lead, you see. Can’t have me… slowing down. Performances… absolutely not. Can’t miss a show. I've got lines to say, makeup to apply. Very important. So… no slowing down. No missing shows. You understand?
DOCTOR: I absolutely understand. That’s very important. And my goal is to help you continue doing what you love without interruption. We'll work together to create a plan that fits your schedule and allows you to stay on top of your performances. I'm going to write you a note excusing you from physical activity if you need it, and I’ll also give you information on how to modify your makeup application technique to minimize stress on your hands. I'm also happy to discuss a referral to an occupational therapist if you'd like. They can provide more specialized exercises and techniques to help you manage your symptoms. Would you be interested in that?
PATIENT: Hmph. Occupational… what-now? Sounds… complicated. More appointments? More poking and prodding? No. No thank you. I can manage. I've been doing makeup for… a long time. I know what I'm doing. Just… give me the exercises. And the note. And let me get on with it. I have a show to prepare for.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. No problem at all. Here are the hand exercises, the information about osteoarthritis, and the note excusing you from strenuous physical activity. I've also included a website with some helpful tips on joint protection. The technician will call you when your X-rays are ready. We can schedule a follow-up appointment to review the results when you're available. Do you have any questions before you go?
PATIENT: Hmph. No. I think that’s all. Just… try not to keep me waiting too long. Shows don't rehearse themselves. And thank you. I suppose.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome. I’ll do my best. And break a leg! We'll see you soon. If anything changes or you have any concerns, please don't hesitate to call the office. Have a good day, Mr. Szmyd. .
PATIENT: Hmph. Goodbye. .
