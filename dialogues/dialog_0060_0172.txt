DOCTOR: Alright, Candice, have a seat. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Well, it’s… a social visit, I believe. My husband insisted. He worries so. New to the area, you see. Everything is so… different. Honestly, I don’t quite recall what needs discussing, but I suppose he made the appointment for a reason. Do get on with it, dear. I haven’t got all day.
DOCTOR: Well, that’s… unusual. Your husband brought you in because he's concerned, and you’re not entirely sure why?
PATIENT: Concerned is his default state, really. Always fussing. I’m perfectly healthy, as far as I know. Always have been. It’s probably just… adjusting. This town is… smaller than what I’m used to. And a lot of… things. I suppose he thinks a doctor’s visit will make me feel… settled? It’s rather silly, if you ask me. Is this going to take long?
DOCTOR: Right. Well, even if you feel perfectly healthy, it’s good to get a baseline check when you move to a new area. Just to be sure. And it's not silly at all for your husband to be concerned. We'll do a quick physical exam, just the basics – blood pressure, heart, lungs, that sort of thing. Then we can talk about any concerns you might have, even if they seem minor. Have you noticed any changes in your health recently?
PATIENT: Changes? Oh, goodness. At my age, everything changes. I forget things more easily, of course. That’s just… getting older. And my knees ache sometimes, but that’s nothing new. Honestly, I don’t bother the doctor with every little twinge. It’s all part of the… process. Is blood pressure terribly important? I always thought it was more of a… bother.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is important, Candice. It's a good indicator of overall health, and can tell us a lot about your heart and blood vessels. We need to check it to make sure everything's functioning properly. And forgetting things can be normal with age, but it’s good to rule out anything else that might be going on. Now, let's start with your weight and height, just for the record. Then we'll move on to blood pressure. Could you step onto the scale for me?
PATIENT: Oh, very well. Though I assure you, it’s unnecessary. I haven’t changed a pound in… decades. Still, if you must. Do hurry, dear.
DOCTOR: Alright, 145 pounds. And your height is… 196 centimeters, correct?
PATIENT: Centimeters? Goodness. I always thought I was… taller than most, but that seems rather… extreme. Are you certain? I always measured around six feet, perhaps a little less. This newfangled metric system is terribly confusing. I suppose you young people are accustomed to it, but it’s all a bother, honestly.
DOCTOR: There may be a slight error in the chart, Candice. We'll double-check that later. For now, let’s just focus on getting a general overview. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmm. Not that I'm aware of. I’ve taken medications when necessary, of course, but never had a… reaction. Though, I did once have a rather unpleasant experience with a tonic. Made me feel quite… unsettled. But that wasn't an allergy, I'm sure. Just a bad batch, most likely. Really, I’m a very robust person. Don't you think?
DOCTOR: Right. And are you currently taking any medications, prescription or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think. My husband gives me something for my… joints, sometimes. A small white pill. And I take a vitamin, occasionally. Though, I forget to most days. Honestly, I don’t bother with all those little pills. They don't seem to do much good. He fusses about it, naturally. He's convinced I need a strict regimen. Is this really necessary?
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you mind if I ask about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Past… medical history? Oh, dear. That's a bit much, isn't it? I've had the usual childhood illnesses, I suppose. Measles, mumps… the things one gets as a child. Nothing serious. And a rather nasty bout of… something when I was younger. But that was decades ago. Honestly, I don’t recall the details. It was all a very long time ago. Are you going to ask about everything?
DOCTOR: Just trying to get a complete picture, Candice. It’s helpful to know if you’ve had any major illnesses or surgeries in the past. For example, have you ever been hospitalized for anything significant?
PATIENT: Hospitalized… Oh. Well, there was that time, many, many years ago. A… complication. After the birth of my son. But it was nothing serious. They fixed it, and I was fine. Honestly, I try not to dwell on unpleasant memories. It was a very long time ago, and I'd rather not… relive it. Is this truly necessary for a social visit?
DOCTOR: It’s helpful to have the information, Candice, even if it was a long time ago. It can sometimes affect your current health. Okay. And what about family history?
PATIENT: Family history? Oh, goodness. That's a rather broad question, isn't it? My mother lived to a ripe old age, I believe. Though, I don’t recall the exact number. She was a… strong woman. My father… well, he had a weak heart, I think. But that was many years ago. Honestly, I wasn’t terribly close to either of them. It's all rather hazy, if you don't mind. I really don't enjoy these sorts of questions. It feels like… prying.
DOCTOR: Alright. And finally, could you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle? Oh, goodness. What does one say about a lifestyle? I enjoy reading, when I have the time. And I try to stay active, though my knees don't always cooperate. We live a quiet life, my husband and I. It's… peaceful. Honestly, it's all rather uneventful. Is this really going to make a difference? I'm perfectly capable of taking care of myself, you know.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, even if you feel perfectly healthy, it’s good to get a baseline check when you move to a new area. Let's just do a quick physical exam, just the basics – blood pressure, heart, lungs, that sort of thing. Could you please lie down on the examination table?
PATIENT: Oh. Very well. Though I assure you, it’s unnecessary. I haven’t felt unwell a day in my life. Still, if you must. Do hurry, dear. This is rather… undignified.
DOCTOR: Alright. Just listening to your heart now. Breathe normally for me. And now, I'm just listening to your lungs. Take a deep breath… and exhale. Heart rate is a bit irregular, and breathing sounds slightly diminished in the lower lobes. Blood pressure is 150/90. That's a little elevated.
PATIENT: Elevated? Oh, goodness. Is that… bad? I told you I was perfectly healthy! My husband will be beside himself. He always worries so. Honestly, I don’t understand all this… technical jargon. Is it something serious? And please, do tell me it’s not contagious. I haven’t got the energy for all that fuss.
DOCTOR: It’s not necessarily serious, Candice, but it's something we need to monitor. Elevated blood pressure can increase your risk of heart disease and stroke, but we can manage it with lifestyle changes and, if necessary, medication. And no, it’s not contagious. It’s not an infection. It's simply a measure of the force of your blood against your artery walls. I'd like to order some further tests, just to get a better understanding of what’s going on. A complete blood count, a basic metabolic panel, and a chest X-ray. Do you have any concerns about getting those done?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. More tests? Honestly, I'm starting to feel like a… specimen. My husband will be delighted, of course. He loves all this… medical attention. But I… I don’t particularly enjoy being poked and prodded. And a chest X-ray? Is that… safe? I’ve heard things… dreadful things… about radiation. Honestly, I think I’d rather just… rest. Is it absolutely necessary? I’m perfectly capable of taking care of myself, you know. Perhaps a cup of tea would be more beneficial.
DOCTOR: Candice, I understand your concerns, but these tests are important for ruling out any underlying issues that could be causing your elevated blood pressure and diminished breathing sounds. The chest X-ray uses a very low dose of radiation, and the benefits of getting a clear picture of your lungs far outweigh the risks. We need to rule out things like pneumonia or heart failure. I strongly recommend getting these tests done. It’s the best way to ensure your health and well-being. And it will give your husband peace of mind, which I’m sure he’d appreciate. I can arrange for them to be done at the clinic tomorrow morning. Would that work for you?
PATIENT: Oh… well. When you put it like that… I suppose you’re right. My husband will be beside himself if I refuse. He’s terribly… insistent. And I suppose a little peace of mind wouldn’t hurt. Though I still think it's all a bit much fuss. Very well. Tomorrow morning, then. But do try to be quick about it. I have… commitments, you know. And please, do make sure everything is… sterile. I’ve heard dreadful stories…
DOCTOR: Alright. I’ll have the nurse schedule those tests for you tomorrow morning. And I’ll make sure everything is sterile, as you requested. So, to recap: we’ve ordered some blood work and a chest X-ray to investigate your elevated blood pressure and diminished breathing sounds. Once we have the results, we can discuss the next steps. In the meantime, I recommend you continue to stay active, eat a healthy diet, and try to manage your stress. We'll also discuss some lifestyle modifications at your follow-up appointment. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Lifestyle modifications… Honestly. It all sounds terribly exhausting. No, I don’t think I have any… questions. Just… please, do hurry. I'm starting to feel quite faint. And do make sure the nurse is… gentle. I've always been a bit sensitive. Perhaps a glass of water would be in order? This whole ordeal has been rather… draining.
DOCTOR: Of course. I'll have the nurse bring you a glass of water right away. And I'll make sure she's gentle. We’ll get you scheduled for those tests, and we’ll follow up with you as soon as we have the results. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms – shortness of breath, chest pain, dizziness – please don’t hesitate to call the clinic. Do you have any other concerns before you leave?
PATIENT: No. I believe that is all. Honestly, it has been quite an ordeal. I simply wish to rest now. Tell my husband… that I’m fine. Perfectly fine. And please, do make sure the waiting room is… quiet. I haven’t the energy for all that chatter. Good day.
DOCTOR: Alright. The nurse will assist you. Have a good day, Candice. .
