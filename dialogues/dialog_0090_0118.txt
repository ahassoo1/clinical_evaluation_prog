DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Oriley. I'm Dr. Kur. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. As I understand it… well, someone informed me I require a… certification? It has to do with my profession, naturally. Honestly, the paperwork these days. It’s quite bothersome. I believe it involves my hearing, or perhaps my eyesight. I confess, I don’t recall the specifics.
DOCTOR: A certification… right. And this was suggested by whom, exactly?
PATIENT: Hmm… Now that is a difficult question. It was… an organization, I believe. Something to do with… maintaining standards. A younger man, quite insistent. I handle a great deal in my line of work, you see. Keeping track of every little regulation is simply beyond me at this point. Honestly, it all feels rather unnecessary.
DOCTOR: And what is your line of work, Mr. Oriley?
PATIENT: I am a healthcare practitioner, Doctor. A rather… specialized one, if I may say so myself. Though, details… they are becoming increasingly hazy. Let’s just say I ensure the… appropriate functioning of certain vital systems. It’s… technical. Very technical. And quite important, naturally. Though I find it rather rude to have to explain my profession.
DOCTOR: I apologize if my question was impolite, Mr. Oriley. However, understanding your profession is rather relevant when determining the necessity of a medical certification, wouldn’t you agree?
PATIENT: Relevant? Perhaps. Though I suspect a great deal of this is simply… bureaucratic overreach. I've been in the field for… a considerable length of time. I assure you, my capabilities are more than adequate. But if you must know… I deal with prosthetics. Advanced ones, mind you. It's… demanding work. Requires a precise understanding of anatomy, engineering, and a great deal of patience. Though, truthfully, the specifics escape me these days. It's the principle of the matter, Doctor. The constant need for… validation.
DOCTOR: Prosthetics. Alright. And this certification… is it specifically related to the fitting and maintenance of these prosthetics, or is it a more general medical examination?
PATIENT: Goodness, I haven't the faintest idea. They didn't explain it to me. Something about ensuring I can still… discern subtle variations in… pressure, I believe? And perhaps visual acuity for alignment. It’s all rather vague. Honestly, Doctor, I simply came because I was told to. I don’t understand why a perfectly capable professional needs to be subjected to such… scrutiny. It’s insulting, frankly. Do you have a schedule for how long this will take? I have several appointments this afternoon.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Oriley. Let's start with a basic physical exam, then. We’ll assess your vision and hearing, as you mentioned, and do a neurological screening to check your reflexes and sensation. It shouldn’t take too long. But I need a complete medical history first. Have you had any major illnesses or surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Major illnesses? At my age? A great many. Nothing of consequence, I assure you. A touch of influenza now and then, the usual aches and pains. Surgeries… yes, there was something involving my shoulder, decades ago. A rotator cuff, I believe. And a minor procedure on my knee. Nothing that would affect my… professional capabilities. Honestly, Doctor, I fail to see the relevance of all this. I'm a perfectly healthy man, despite my years. And I assure you, I have excellent reflexes. Would you like me to demonstrate?
DOCTOR: While I appreciate your enthusiasm, Mr. Oriley, a self-assessment isn't quite sufficient for medical documentation. And knowing your past medical history is relevant. It helps me understand any potential underlying conditions that might be contributing to… whatever issue prompted this certification request. So, let’s try this again. Specifically, have you been diagnosed with any chronic conditions, like diabetes, heart disease, or arthritis?
PATIENT: Chronic conditions… now you’re asking about things I haven’t considered in years. Let me think… My first wife’s mother had… something with her joints. Arthritis, perhaps? Dreadful condition. As for myself, I occasionally experience a bit of stiffness in the mornings. And my blood pressure… it sometimes fluctuates, but nothing to be alarmed about. I take a small pill now and then. A blue one, I believe. Honestly, Doctor, this is becoming quite tedious. Is it absolutely necessary to delve into such minutiae? I have a very busy schedule, you know. And frankly, my memory isn’t what it used to be. Perhaps a brief assessment of my practical skills would be more… illuminating?
DOCTOR: Mr. Oriley, with all due respect, a “brief assessment of practical skills” is not a substitute for a medical evaluation. You came to me seeking… validation for a certification. A certification that, based on your description, appears to be related to your physical and neurological health. Therefore, I need a complete medical history to determine if you are fit to continue your profession. Now, can you tell me the name of that blue pill you mentioned?
PATIENT: Oh, for goodness sake. This is utterly ridiculous. A blue pill… Honestly, Doctor, I have no idea. I simply take it when my… numbers are a bit high. My blood pressure, you see. The pharmacy delivers it, automatically. A small blue capsule. I assure you, it’s perfectly harmless. And frankly, I find your insistence on such trivial details rather… demeaning. I am a professional, Doctor. I have been practicing for decades. I do not need to be interrogated like a common criminal. Is there no way to simply… demonstrate my competence? Perhaps a practical examination involving a prosthetic limb? I could show you my work. It speaks for itself. .
DOCTOR: Mr. Oriley, I understand your frustration. However, I cannot, in good conscience, provide a medical certification without a thorough evaluation. And frankly, your reluctance to provide basic medical information is… concerning. I suggest you consult with another physician who may be more willing to accommodate your… preferences. However, I strongly advise you to prioritize a complete medical assessment, regardless of who you choose. It is in your best interest, and the best interest of your patients. .
