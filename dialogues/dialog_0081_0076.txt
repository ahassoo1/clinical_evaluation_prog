DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Aluia. I’m Dr. Paulino. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Please, call me Clarke. Well, it’s these bumps on my legs, see? On my shins. They’re red and…painful. Not all the time, but they bother me. Especially when I’m walking around, you know, doing things.
DOCTOR: “These bumps,” alright. And how long have you noticed these bumps on your shins, Clarke?
PATIENT: Hmm, that’s a good question. I think…maybe a couple of months now? It started with just one or two, and I didn't think much of it. Thought I bumped into something, you know? But then more kept showing up. It’s been getting a little worse lately, that’s why I figured I should get it checked.
DOCTOR: “A couple of months.” And are these bumps associated with any specific activity?
PATIENT: Specific activity? Not that I can think of. I work, you know, moving stuff around…boxes, materials. It’s pretty physical work, but I've been doing that for years. I haven't done anything different recently. Maybe…walking more? My wife and I try to take a walk every evening, but that's new only for a few months too. Does that count?
DOCTOR: Walking more… right. And would you describe the pain as… sharp, dull, burning?
PATIENT: It's not really sharp, Doctor. More like…a deep ache? Especially after I’ve been on my feet for a while. Like my shins are sore all the way through. And sometimes…they feel hot, yeah, kinda like burning, but not a bad burn, if that makes sense. Just…warm and uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: “Warm and uncomfortable.” Alright. And have you noticed any other changes to your legs – swelling, redness spreading around the bumps, any blisters or open sores?
PATIENT: No blisters, no sores, definitely not. No spreading, either. The red stays right on the bump. Sometimes the skin around it feels a little…tougher, maybe? Like it’s a bit thicker where the bump is, but not swollen. Just…different feeling. It’s hard to explain. I’m not good at describing things, sorry.
DOCTOR: "It’s alright, Clarke. I’ll need to examine your legs now. Please, if you could sit on the examination table and elevate your legs so I can get a better look.”
PATIENT: Okay, sure. No problem. Here you go. They're not easy to see sometimes, they kinda blend in with my skin, you know? I’ll try to keep them up.
DOCTOR: Hm. Yes, I see them. They are somewhat subtle. And I feel…increased firmness. Not a great deal of warmth to the touch. Are you experiencing any itching, Clarke?
PATIENT: No itching, Doctor. Not at all. Just the ache, like I said. And…sometimes they feel a little tender if I press on them too hard. Oh, that one’s a little sensitive, sorry.
DOCTOR: Right. And you said you work with boxes and materials?
PATIENT: Yeah, that's right. Mostly loading and unloading. I’ve been doing that work for…oh, goodness, almost 40 years now. It keeps me busy, that’s for sure. Sometimes I stand for hours at a time, you know? And it’s not always a smooth floor, either. Lots of concrete. Do you think that could have something to do with it?
DOCTOR: Well, concrete floors and prolonged standing can contribute to a variety of musculoskeletal issues. However, based on the appearance and palpation of these bumps, my preliminary assessment suggests these are likely shin splints – more specifically, chronic exertional compartment syndrome. It’s common in individuals with high activity levels, particularly those who experience repetitive impact. It's hardly a cause for alarm.
PATIENT: Shin…splints? Compartment…syndrome? I'm sorry, Doctor, I don't really understand. Is that…serious? Do I need to stop working? I kinda need the job, you know? And what do you even do about shin splints? Is it something I can just…rub on? I've always just rubbed things when they hurt.
DOCTOR: "Rubbing things," Clarke, with all due respect, this is a medical condition, not a simple bruise. Shin splints, or medial tibial stress syndrome, is inflammation of the muscles, tendons, and bone tissue around your tibia. Compartment syndrome, in this case chronic exertional, occurs when pressure builds up within the muscles, causing pain and discomfort. It's not immediately life-threatening, but it can become debilitating if left unaddressed. Stopping work entirely isn't necessarily required, but reducing impact activities is crucial. We’ll start with conservative management: rest, ice, compression, elevation – RICE. I’ll prescribe a course of anti-inflammatory medication to help manage the pain and reduce inflammation. Furthermore, proper footwear with adequate support is essential. I suggest orthotics. We'll monitor your progress. If symptoms persist despite these measures, further investigation – perhaps an MRI – will be necessary to rule out a stress fracture.
PATIENT: Okay…wow. That’s…a lot. Rest, ice, compression, elevation. RICE, right? And pills. And…what were those things again? Or…thotics? Are those like…special shoes? I've got some pretty old work boots, I guess…they're comfortable. I don't know about special shoes. And an MRI? That sounds expensive. I'm on Medicare, will that cover it? This is a little overwhelming, Doctor. I just wanted something for the pain.
DOCTOR: Yes, Clarke, RICE. And orthotics are shoe inserts – customized supports that help distribute pressure more evenly. They're not a matter of comfort, they’re a medical necessity in your case. Regarding the MRI, Medicare typically covers it if deemed medically necessary. We'll submit the appropriate documentation. However, let's not jump to conclusions. We’ll start with the conservative measures – rest, ice, compression, elevation, and the anti-inflammatory medication. I'll write you a prescription for naproxen. Take two tablets twice daily with food. Here’s the prescription. And here's a handout explaining shin splints and proper self-care. Follow these instructions diligently. Return in two weeks for a follow-up appointment. If your pain worsens before then, contact the office immediately. Do you have any other questions?
PATIENT: Okay…naproxen, two times a day. And…shin splint paper. Two weeks. I think…I think that’s all. It’s just…a lot to remember. I’m an old man, Doctor. My memory isn’t what it used to be. Maybe my wife can help me keep track of the pills. Thank you…I guess. I hope this works. I really don’t want to stop working.
DOCTOR: Very well, Clarke. Ensure strict adherence to the protocol. It's the most effective course of action at this stage. And try not to overexert yourself. You may get dressed now. .
