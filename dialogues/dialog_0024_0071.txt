DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Skarbek. I am Dr. Mutnick. Now, let’s get straight to the point. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s a bit of a complicated thing, really. A friend of mine... he's hoping to come to the United States, and I believe he needs some shots before he can get a visa. I’m trying to help him figure out what’s required, and I thought you might be the person to ask. I'm Karry Skarbek, by the way.
DOCTOR: A visa, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, sir. He's applying for… well, I don’t know the specifics, honestly. He’s mentioned needing to prove he’s healthy, and I understand vaccinations are a big part of that. He's from… let me think… Romania, I believe. A lovely country, from what I hear. I just want to make sure he doesn’t run into any trouble with the paperwork, you see. It can be a real headache, dealing with all that.
DOCTOR: Mr. Skarbek, with all due respect, I am a family physician. I treat patients. I don’t provide pre-immigration vaccination consultations for individuals who aren’t even here. It’s… quite frankly, a misuse of my time. Do you have a medical issue you need addressed today?
PATIENT: Oh. Well, goodness. I… I didn't realize. I apologize, Doctor. I just thought… seeing as how you’re a doctor, and he needs to see a doctor… I didn’t mean to cause any trouble. I suppose I assumed it was something you handled. I haven’t had much experience with this sort of thing. Perhaps you could point me in the right direction? Someone who does handle these sorts of questions? I really just want to help my friend, and I'm a bit lost.
DOCTOR: Look, Mr. Skarbek. The CDC website has detailed immigration vaccination requirements. That is where you should begin. Or, contact an immigration lawyer. They frequently have resources for this. I simply do not have the bandwidth to provide guidance on matters that do not concern my direct patients. Now, is there anything you are experiencing that requires my attention?
PATIENT: The CDC website, you say? Alright. I can certainly look into that. I'm not very good with computers, I confess, but I’ll ask a neighbor to help me navigate it. An immigration lawyer… that might be a good idea too. No, Doctor, nothing I’m experiencing at the moment. Just trying to be a good friend. Thank you for your time, and for pointing me in the right direction. I truly appreciate it. I didn't mean to take up too much of your day.
DOCTOR: Very well. If you develop any medical concerns, feel free to schedule an appointment. Have a good day, Mr. Skarbek.
PATIENT: Yes, sir. I will. Thank you again, Doctor. You have a good day as well.
DOCTOR: Good day. .
PATIENT:
