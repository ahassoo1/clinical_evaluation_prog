DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Komarov. I’m Dr. Chora. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it's about my eyes, really. They've been bothering me a lot lately with the sun. Anything bright, actually. It’s… hard to explain. Like, really uncomfortable, and sometimes I see spots. It started a few months ago, maybe around April?
DOCTOR: Okay, uncomfortable with bright light and seeing spots… started around April. Let’s try to narrow that down a bit. When you say uncomfortable, is that pain, burning, or just…sensitivity?
PATIENT: Hmm… not exactly pain, Doctor. It's more like… a really strong glare, even with sunglasses on. And it makes my eyes feel tired, like they’re straining. Burning is close, but it’s not a constant burn, just when it’s really bright. And yes, definitely strain. It feels like I've been staring at something for hours.
DOCTOR: Alright, glare, strain, and triggered by bright light – and it's not a constant burning sensation. Do you notice any difference in your vision when this is happening?
PATIENT: Yes, actually. Things get a bit blurry, especially after I’ve been in the sun for a while. And sometimes… it's hard to focus. Like when I'm trying to read something, the letters kind of swim around. It doesn't last long though, usually goes away after I’m out of the light.
DOCTOR: Okay, blurry vision and difficulty focusing after sun exposure. Have you had any changes in your vision before the sun exposure, like noticing things are generally less clear or more difficult to see even in normal lighting?
PATIENT: No, not really, Doctor. Everything’s been pretty normal before the light stuff starts. I wear glasses for reading, have for years, but the prescription hasn't changed recently, at least not that I know of. My last eye exam was… let me think… sometime last year, maybe February? They said everything was stable then.
DOCTOR: Alright, stable prescription as of February last year. And just to be thorough, has this been accompanied by any headaches, nausea, or any other symptoms besides the light sensitivity, strain, and blurry vision?
PATIENT: No, thankfully. No headaches or nausea. Just the eyes, really. Though... now that you mention it, I have been feeling a bit more tired lately, overall. But I thought that was just… life, you know? Being on my feet all day at work. I don’t know if that’s related. It’s been a long few months.
DOCTOR: Okay, increased overall fatigue as well. Let’s move on to some general medical questions then. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No known allergies at all. I've never had a reaction to anything, as far as I can remember. My wife… well, she had a few, but I don't. Just me, thankfully. She always remembered everything like that, though. I sometimes forget what I had for breakfast! But not allergies, no.
DOCTOR: Alright, no allergies. And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, nothing at all. I try to avoid taking anything if I can help it. Just water and a bit of tea, mostly. I don’t really believe in all those pills, if you know what I mean. I used to take something for my blood pressure a few years ago, but the doctor took me off it. That was… maybe five years ago? But that's it.
DOCTOR: Okay, no current medications, off blood pressure medication five years ago. Now, could you tell me a bit about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Well, nothing too exciting, Doctor. I had the usual childhood illnesses, you know, chickenpox, measles… nothing serious. I broke my arm once when I was a kid, fell out of a tree. But other than that… I had pneumonia a few years back, but I recovered fully. And… I had surgery for appendicitis when I was in my early twenties. That was pretty scary, but that's it, really. I've been pretty lucky, I think. My wife… she had a lot more problems, unfortunately.
DOCTOR: Okay, childhood illnesses, pneumonia, and appendectomy. Now, regarding family history—do you have any family members with eye problems, like glaucoma, macular degeneration, or cataracts?
PATIENT: Hmm… that's a good question. My mother… she wore glasses when she got older, but I don’t know what exactly was wrong with her eyes. She just said her vision got blurry. My father, he had diabetes, but I don’t think it affected his eyes. He did have a lot of problems with his feet, though. And… my wife's mother had cataracts, I think. But that's all I can really remember. It's… hard to keep track, you know? They lived back home, and we didn’t talk as often as we should have.
DOCTOR: Okay, mother with blurry vision, diabetes in father, cataracts in wife's mother. And finally, just a couple of social history questions. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, none of that. Never smoked a day in my life, and I don't drink. Not a fan, really. And definitely no drugs. I work hard, and I like to keep things simple. Just tea, water, and a bit of quiet when I can get it. I work at the dental office, you know, so I see enough of that during the day.
DOCTOR: Alright, no smoking, alcohol, or drugs. Okay, Mr. Komarov, thank you for that information. Let's do a quick examination of your eyes, if that's alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds good. Whatever you think is best. I’m ready when you are. Just let me know if there’s anything I need to do.
DOCTOR: Okay. Could you look straight ahead for me, please?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, looking straight ahead. Is the light bright? It's… a little uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. I'm trying to get a good look at your pupils and retina. Alright, I'm noting some mild redness in both eyes, and your pupils are reacting normally to light, but they are slightly constricted. I'm going to check your visual acuity now. Can you read the letters on this chart, starting with the top line?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, I can try. Let's see… uh… is that an 'F'? No, wait… 'P'? Yes, I think it's 'P'. It’s a bit blurry, honestly. I'm not sure about the next ones.
DOCTOR: Okay, I'm noting a reduced visual acuity. You're about 20/30 in your right eye and 20/40 in your left eye. Let me check your peripheral vision now. Can you tell me when you see my finger in your side vision?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, I’m focusing straight ahead. Uh… I see it now! On the left. And… now the right? Yes, I see it on the right too. It's… faint, though. And I have to really concentrate to see it. It's not like it just pops out, you know? Like there’s a shadow around the edges.
DOCTOR: Okay, I’m noting some slight constriction in your peripheral vision. Now I will test the muscles that move your eyes. Follow my penlight with your eyes, without moving your head, please. And now the other eye. Alright, your extraocular muscles seem to be functioning normally. One last thing, I am going to check the pressure in your eyes. This will feel like a slight pressure on your eye, but it shouldn’t be painful. Just relax and look straight ahead.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. Relax and look straight ahead… That was a bit uncomfortable, yes. But I'm trying to relax. Just let me know when you're done. It just feels…squishy.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Komarov, all done. Your intraocular pressure is slightly elevated in both eyes—around 22 mmHg in the right eye and 24 mmHg in the left. Normal is usually between 10 and 21 mmHg. Okay, based on everything—your symptoms, the examination findings, and your medical history—it appears you may be experiencing early signs of glaucoma. The elevated intraocular pressure, constricted pupils, slightly reduced visual acuity, and constriction in your peripheral vision are all consistent with that. The redness is likely due to the pressure. Now, I want to be very clear, this is a preliminary assessment. I need to order some further tests to confirm this diagnosis. I want to get you in for a visual field test and a Gonioscopy. That's where they will examine the drainage angle of your eyes to see how well fluid is draining.
PATIENT: Glaucoma…? Is that… serious, Doctor? I mean, I just thought my eyes were getting tired. And my vision blurry with the sun. What does this mean? And those tests… are they painful? I don't like things poked and prodded, you know. My wife... she didn’t like those tests either.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Komarov. It's natural to be worried when you hear a diagnosis like glaucoma. It is a serious condition, but it’s often very manageable, especially when caught early, which, thankfully, seems to be the case with you. Essentially, glaucoma damages the optic nerve, which is crucial for vision. The elevated pressure in your eyes is putting stress on that nerve. If left untreated, it can lead to vision loss. However, with treatment—usually eye drops or, in some cases, laser surgery—we can lower the pressure and slow or even prevent further damage. Regarding the tests—the visual field test is painless. You just look straight ahead and press a button when you see a light. It takes about 30 minutes. The Gonioscopy involves a special lens placed briefly on your eye after numbing drops are applied. You might feel a little pressure, but it's generally not painful. It just helps us determine the type of glaucoma you have, if that's the case. It won’t take long at all. I'm going to write you a referral to Dr. Anya Sharma, she's an excellent ophthalmologist specializing in glaucoma. She'll be able to perform those tests and discuss treatment options with you in detail. I'll also give you a prescription for a mild eye drop called Latanoprost. It can help lower your eye pressure in the meantime, while you wait for your appointment. We’ll have you come in for a follow up to see how your response is to the medication. Does that make sense, Mr. Komarov?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that makes a bit more sense. Lower the pressure…eye drops…and see Dr. Sharma. Latanoprost… that's a mouthful. And it helps now while I wait? That’s good. It's just… a lot to take in. My wife used to handle all these things… she was so good at remembering everything. So, the drops… how often do I use them? And what if they make my vision blurry? I need to be able to see to work, you know. And what about the sun? Should I stay inside? It's what started all this, after all.
DOCTOR: It is a lot to take in, and it's perfectly alright to feel overwhelmed. We'll go through it step by step. Latanoprost—you'll put one drop in each eye every evening, before bed. It can sometimes cause a slight stinging sensation for a few seconds, but that usually goes away quickly. In rare cases, it can cause a temporary blurring of vision, but that's uncommon. If your vision does get blurry, let Dr. Sharma know immediately. She can adjust the dosage or switch you to a different medication. Don't drive or operate machinery if you experience blurry vision. Regarding the sun—while it's likely a trigger for your symptoms, staying inside completely isn’t necessary. But do protect your eyes. Wear sunglasses that block 100% of UVA and UVB rays, and consider a wide-brimmed hat when you're outdoors. I’ll give you a written instruction sheet with everything we discussed. And I’m going to write you a note for work, explaining your condition and the need for occasional breaks. I'll also include Dr. Sharma's contact information. Here is a referral for Dr. Sharma, a prescription for Latanoprost, the written instructions, and the work note. Do you have any other questions for me at this time, Mr. Komarov?
PATIENT: No, Doctor… I think that's everything for now. You’ve been very helpful. Sunglasses…hat…Dr. Sharma… I'll try to remember everything. It's just… a bit scary. Thank you, Doctor Chora. I really appreciate your kindness. I guess I’ll go get those drops and schedule an appointment with Dr. Sharma. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Komarov. Don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns after you leave. And remember, early detection is key, and we're here to support you every step of the way. Take care, and have a good day. .
