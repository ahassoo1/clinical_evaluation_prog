DOCTOR: Hi Betty, welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Maskal. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello dear. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, it’s my hearing, I think. It’s just… not what it used to be. Everything sounds a bit muffled, you know? Hard to catch what folks are sayin’ sometimes. Not sure when it started, really. Just… gradual, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. So it's been a gradual decline in your hearing, and things sound muffled. That can be frustrating. Can you tell me a little more about when you first started noticing it?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. When… that’s a tricky one. Seems like… a while now. Maybe a few years? I used to work in a shoe factory, lots of noise, clatterin’ machines all day. Could be somethin’ to do with that, I don’t know. It’s hard to say exactly when it started gettin’ bad, honestly. My memory ain’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Betty. A few years is helpful to know. And working in a shoe factory with all that noise definitely could be a factor. We’ll try to figure things out. Do you notice it more in certain situations?
PATIENT: Hmm… certain situations… Yes, I think so. It’s worse when there’s a lot of chatter, like at the diner. And when people don’t look at me when they’re talkin’. If I can’t see their face, it’s even harder to understand. Quiet places are better, naturally. And one-on-one conversations are much easier than a group. Though even then, sometimes I gotta ask folks to repeat themselves.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it's worse in noisy environments, with multiple people talking, and when you can’t see the speaker’s face. And you find yourself needing people to repeat things, even in one-on-one conversations. Have you noticed any ringing in your ears, or any pain or fullness in either ear?
PATIENT: Ringing… now that you mention it, sometimes. It’s not constant, just a little… shhh sound, now and then. Mostly when it’s quiet. Doesn't hurt, though. And no pain, no fullness. Just… hard to hear, mostly. Like someone turned the volume down real low.
DOCTOR: Alright, intermittent ringing in your ears, no pain or fullness. That’s good to know. Now, have you ever had any ear infections, or any problems with your ears in the past?
PATIENT: Ear infections… Oh dear. Let me think… I think I had one when I was a little girl, maybe? A bad one. But that was a long, long time ago. Aside from that… nothin’ I can recall, really. I’ve never had anythin’ done to my ears, if that’s what you mean. No tubes, no surgery, nothin’ like that. Just… the usual wax build-up, I suppose, when I got older. Nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a childhood ear infection, but nothing significant since then. No ear tubes or surgery. Just occasional wax buildup. Do you take any medications regularly, or have any allergies to anything?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see… I take somethin’ for my blood pressure, a little white pill. And that’s about it, I think. Allergies… not that I know of. I eat just about anything. Never had a reaction to nothin’, knock on wood. . I do get a little sniffly in the spring, but I just thought that was the pollen.
DOCTOR: Okay, a medication for blood pressure and no known allergies other than seasonal pollen. That's helpful. Now, I'd like to do a quick exam of your ears, just to take a look and see what's going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, dear, that’s fine. Whatever you think is best. Go right ahead. I trust your judgment. Just be gentle, alright? My ears are a bit sensitive, you know. .
DOCTOR: Certainly, Betty. I will be very gentle. Okay, I'm taking a look now. I see a little bit of wax in both ears, but nothing that's obviously blocking the canal. Your eardrums look intact, but they are a little bit dull in color. I don't see any signs of infection or fluid behind the eardrums. Based on what you've told me, and the exam findings, it sounds like you likely have some age-related hearing loss, possibly compounded by noise exposure from your previous work. The wax buildup could also be contributing to the problem. It’s called presbycusis, and it’s pretty common as we get older.
PATIENT: Presby… what now? Oh dear. Is that… bad? I knew I shouldn’t have stayed so close to those machines all those years. So, it’s just… old age, then? And the wax? What can we do about it? Will I go deaf?
DOCTOR: It’s pronounced pres-bih-KOO-sis. And no, it’s not necessarily “bad,” but it is common. It just means you've experienced some natural hearing decline over time. The noise exposure likely sped things up a bit, but it's something that happens to most people eventually. We can definitely do something about it! First, we can remove the wax buildup. That might improve your hearing right away. Then, we can discuss hearing aids if you're interested. They can really help amplify sounds and make conversations easier. You won't go deaf, Betty. Hearing loss is usually gradual, and hearing aids can help you maintain a good quality of life. We'll take it one step at a time. Would you like me to remove the wax first?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s a relief to hear, dear. Not deaf, you say? Good. Wax removal sounds good, then. Get rid of that gunk, maybe that’ll help. What’s involved in that? Does it hurt? I don’t like things poked and prodded, you know.
DOCTOR: I understand your apprehension, Betty. We'll be as gentle as possible. There are a few ways to remove the wax. We can try a simple irrigation with warm water. It feels a bit like a gentle stream of water in your ear. Or, if that doesn’t work, I can use a small, curved instrument to carefully remove the wax. It doesn’t usually hurt, but you might feel a little bit of pressure or discomfort. I’ll explain everything step-by-step before we start, and we can stop at any time if you’re uncomfortable. We’ll start with the irrigation, okay?
PATIENT: Irrigation… that sounds a bit better than poked and prodded, I suppose. Warm water… alright, dear. As long as it’s gentle. And you promise you’ll stop if it bothers me? My ears are very sensitive, you know.
DOCTOR: I promise, Betty. We’ll go very slowly, and we’ll stop immediately if you feel any pain or discomfort. Okay, I’m going to tilt your head slightly to the side, and gently put a few drops of warm water into your ear. It might feel a little strange, but it shouldn’t hurt. Then, I’ll use the bulb syringe to gently flush out the ear canal. I’ll look in with the otoscope to see if we’re making progress. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Alright, dear. Sounds… alright. Just be gentle, remember? And tell me if you see anything… weird. I trust you, but… well, it’s my ears, you know? They’re precious to me.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Betty. I’ll be very gentle, and I’ll explain everything as we go. Okay, just a few drops… Now, I’m going to gently flush the ear canal with the bulb syringe. You might feel a little bit of pressure. There we go… I’m seeing some wax come out… Good. Let me take a look… Okay, it’s looking better. Still a little bit of wax in there, but it’s definitely looser now. We can repeat the process a few times. How are you feeling so far?
PATIENT: It’s… a little strange, dear. A little bit of pressure, like water in my ear, but not painful. It feels… cleaner, maybe? Hard to describe. Yes, it does feel a bit better. Do you think you’re getting it all out? I’d like to be able to hear my grandson better, he mumbles so!
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, Betty! And yes, it is getting cleaner. We'll do a few more irrigations on each ear. It takes a bit of time, but we’re making progress. Okay, I've flushed both ears a few times now. I think we’ve gotten the majority of the wax out. Let me take a look… Okay, your ear canals are looking much clearer now. There might be a tiny bit of wax still left deep inside, but it shouldn’t affect your hearing. Would you like me to check your hearing with a simple screening test to see if there's been any improvement?
PATIENT: A hearing test? Oh, alright dear. If you think it’s a good idea. It couldn’t hurt, could it? I just want to be able to hear properly again, that’s all. I miss hearing the birds sing, and my grandson… well, he’s a lovely boy, but he does mumble!
DOCTOR: It won't hurt at all, Betty. It’s a very simple test. I’ll put some headphones on you, and you’ll hear a series of beeps and tones. You just need to indicate when you hear them. It helps us see how well you're hearing different frequencies. It'll take about five minutes. Okay, I'm going to start the test now. Just press the button whenever you hear a beep. Don't worry if you miss some, just do your best. Okay, we're finished with the test. Let me take a look at the results... Alright, the results show some hearing loss, particularly in the higher frequencies. This is pretty common with age, and it’s consistent with what we saw during the exam. It explains why you're having trouble hearing softer sounds and higher-pitched voices. The wax removal helped a little, but the hearing loss is significant enough that I would recommend considering a hearing aid.
PATIENT: A hearing aid? Oh dear. Those things… are they big and clunky? I’ve seen some awful ones in the pictures. And expensive, I imagine? I don’t know… I was hoping just gettin’ the wax out would do it.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Betty. Hearing aids have come a long way in recent years. They are much smaller and more discreet than they used to be. Many of them are practically invisible. And while they can be an investment, there are many different options available to fit different budgets. We don’t have to make a decision right now. If you’re interested, I can refer you to an audiologist. They are specialists in hearing aids and can assess your hearing loss in more detail and recommend the best option for you. They can also discuss financing options. Would you like me to write a referral for you?
PATIENT: An audiologist… yes, that sounds sensible. Someone who knows all about these things. I suppose it wouldn't hurt to just see what they have to offer, would it? No obligation, you say? Just to look and learn?
DOCTOR: Exactly, Betty. No obligation at all. Just a consultation to see if a hearing aid is right for you. I'll write a referral to a highly-rated audiologist in the area. They’ll do a comprehensive hearing test and discuss your options. Here's the referral. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: No, dear, I think that’s everything. You’ve been very kind and patient with me. Thank you for takin’ the time to listen. And for not laughin’ at my mumblin’. I suppose I should be gettin’ home now. My grandson will be wonderin’ where I am. He’s a good boy, you know. Always lookin’ after me. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Betty. It was my pleasure. And don’t worry about mumbling – we all have our moments! It sounds like you have a wonderful grandson. Take care, and please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions. Have a lovely day!
