DOCTOR: Right, yes. Mr. Drahota, is it?
PATIENT: Yes, that is correct. And please, let’s not dawdle. I have… commitments. Is this going to take long? My wife is expecting me.
DOCTOR: Well, that depends on you, doesn’t it?
PATIENT: A rather unhelpful answer, Doctor… Osga, was it? I came because of this… discoloration. It’s quite bothersome, and frankly, it makes me look unwell. I work with iron all day, you see. Strong work. Not like… desk jobs. It comes with its own problems, I suppose. But still. Get on with it.
DOCTOR: Iron, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, reinforcing iron. Rebar, mostly. For buildings, bridges… important things. And it's not just the iron, though that’s likely the root of it. I’ve been… tired lately. A great deal of fatigue. And this skin darkening… it seems to be getting worse, despite my best efforts. Though frankly, I haven’t much time for “efforts” these days.
DOCTOR: Fatigue and skin darkening… right. And where exactly is this discoloration, Mr. Drahota?
PATIENT: It’s… everywhere, really. My hands, mostly, but it’s creeping up my arms. And my face, I suspect. It’s hard to tell. I don’t spend much time looking at myself. A waste of time, if you ask me. Practicality is key. Though I suppose that’s a lost cause with… this. It’s a sort of… bronze hue, I believe. It’s not attractive.
DOCTOR: Bronze hue… all over. Very well. Let’s have a look, shall we?
PATIENT: Do be quick about it. I haven't got all day, you know. And try not to make a mess. My wife doesn't appreciate it when I track things into the house.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Yes, I see. There is some hyperpigmentation. And it appears to be more pronounced on the dorsal surfaces. Have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hyperpig-what now? Doctor, are you deliberately trying to confuse me? I simply said my skin is darkening. As for other symptoms… well, I tire easily. A great deal of thirst, perhaps. And a… general feeling of unwellness. But honestly, at my age, one expects a few aches and pains. It’s probably just old age. Let’s not overcomplicate things.
DOCTOR: "Old age" isn't a diagnosis, Mr. Drahota. Thirst, fatigue, hyperpigmentation… have you noticed any abdominal pain, nausea, or changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Abdominal… Now you're asking about my digestion? Really, Doctor. This is quite unnecessary. I suppose… a little discomfort, occasionally. But I eat heartily, and a bit of indigestion is to be expected. Bowel habits are… regular enough. I fail to see what any of this has to do with my skin. Is there a point to all these questions, or are we simply cataloging the ailments of a senior citizen?
DOCTOR: Right. And any family history of… anything like this?
PATIENT: Family history… Goodness. My parents… they were Chinese, you know. Came over a long time ago. They worked hard, simple lives. I don't recall any… skin troubles. Though my mother did have a rather persistent cough in her later years. And my grandfather… he was a farmer, I believe. A quiet man. No, no history of anything like this. It's likely just… me. Honestly, Doctor, I'm beginning to regret coming here. This is a complete waste of time.
DOCTOR: Very well. I'll need to run some tests. Blood work, to start. And perhaps a liver function panel. It could be a number of things. We'll see. Nurse will take you now.
PATIENT: Tests? Blood work? Honestly. All this fuss over a little discoloration. Very well. Get it over with quickly, please. I have a wife waiting. And I sincerely hope these tests don't take all day. One last thing, Doctor. Will this… interfere with my work? I have commitments, you see. Important commitments. .
