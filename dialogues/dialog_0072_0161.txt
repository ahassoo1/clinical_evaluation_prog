DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Trefren. I’m Dr. Hembrey. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Well, to be frank, a friend suggested I look into this… PrEP thing. She said it’s a way to, you know, stay healthy. I’m 55, and frankly, I’m not looking for any surprises. I just want to be careful. Is that making any sense?
DOCTOR: It does, Ms. Trefren. PrEP, or pre-exposure prophylaxis, is a medication taken to prevent HIV. Your friend is right to suggest it as a way to stay healthy. However, it’s generally considered for individuals at higher risk of exposure. Before we discuss whether it’s appropriate for you, can you tell me a bit more about why you’re considering it?
PATIENT: Higher risk… Hmm. Well, I haven’t… I haven’t been with anyone regularly in a long time, if that makes a difference. Honestly, I just read some things online and got a little worried. You hear stories, you know? And I figure it's better to be safe than sorry. I mostly just want to understand what it is, really. And if it’s even something I need to bother with at my age.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. Trefren. It’s always wise to be informed. The internet can be…a source of a great deal of information, not all of it accurate, of course. Let's clarify a few things. PrEP is a daily medication, typically a pill, and it’s quite effective when taken consistently. However, it does have potential side effects, and it requires regular monitoring with blood tests. Given your history – or, rather, your current lack of sexual activity – it’s less common to recommend it. But let’s be thorough. Have you had any new sexual partners recently, even a one-time encounter?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, absolutely not. Like I said, it's been a long time. Years. I haven't even thought about that part of my life much lately, to be honest. I just… read about it and started to worry. I guess it got in my head. It's good to be careful, right? But if it's not something I really need, I don't want to put something in my body for no reason. Do those blood tests hurt?
DOCTOR: It's sensible to be cautious, Ms. Trefren, but also sensible to avoid unnecessary medication. The blood tests are quite routine. A small sample is taken from your arm, and there’s usually a brief pinch – most people tolerate it very well. They are necessary, however, to assess your overall health and to ensure you don’t have any underlying conditions that would make PrEP unsuitable. Before we dismiss it entirely, let's review your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any chronic illnesses – diabetes, high blood pressure, kidney problems, anything like that?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… well, the doctor told me my cholesterol was a little high last year, so I’m taking a statin for that. Other than that, no, not really. I had the usual childhood stuff, but nothing serious. My knees bother me sometimes, being tall, you know, but that's about it. And I get a little tired easily, but who doesn’t these days? Does the cholesterol medicine interact with this PrEP thing? That’s what I’m worried about – mixing pills.
DOCTOR: Alright, a statin for cholesterol is good to know. Drug interactions are a consideration with PrEP, so it’s important we address that. Certain medications can interfere with its effectiveness, and vice versa. Now, just to be thorough, have you ever been tested for HIV or other sexually transmitted infections in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Years ago, when things were… different. I think it was back in the early nineties. Everything came back negative, thankfully. It was just a standard test, though. I don’t remember the specifics. I was young and… well, it’s a long story. I haven't really thought about it since. Does that matter? Should I have that tested again?
DOCTOR: It does matter, Ms. Trefren. Knowing your previous HIV status is important. While a negative test from the nineties is reassuring, testing guidelines have evolved. A more recent test is always prudent, particularly before starting a preventative medication. Now, let's move on to a general health overview. Do you smoke or use tobacco products?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, never. Tried it once in college, didn’t like it. Always been a healthy eater, too. Lots of fruits and vegetables. My mother always said a good diet was the best medicine, and she was right. She lived to be 92. I don’t drink much alcohol either, maybe a glass of wine with dinner occasionally. I really try to take care of myself, you know? So this whole thing feels… strange. Like I'm doing something I shouldn't be.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear, Ms. Trefren. A healthy lifestyle is certainly a foundation for good health. Given your history – no current sexual activity, previous negative HIV test, healthy habits – the risk of HIV exposure appears very low. At this point, I'm not convinced PrEP is necessary or even appropriate for you. However, I understand your concerns and want to ensure you feel completely comfortable. Before we conclude, I’d like to perform a brief physical exam – just to assess your overall health and rule out any underlying issues. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh. Well… alright. I suppose if you think it's best. I'm not crazy about doctors, to be honest, but I trust your judgement. It’s just… I feel a bit silly, getting poked and prodded for something that probably isn't even a problem. But if it will put my mind at ease, I guess I’m willing. Is it going to take long? I have a bingo game at three.
DOCTOR: It won’t take long, Ms. Trefren. Just a quick listen to your heart and lungs, a check of your blood pressure, and I’ll palpate your abdomen. Standard procedure. Let’s start with your blood pressure. Please relax your arm. 130 over 80. Slightly elevated, but not concerning given your age and a possible white coat effect. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, no masses palpated. Overall, your physical exam is unremarkable. This supports my initial assessment – you appear to be in good health.
PATIENT: Oh. Well, that’s… reassuring, I suppose. So you’re saying I don’t need this PrEP thing? That's a relief. I mean, I'm glad I came, just to be sure. But it sounds like I was worrying over nothing. Honestly, the internet… It just scares you with all those stories. I think I'm going to stay away from it for a while. So, am I all set then? Can I go play my bingo?
DOCTOR: Precisely, Ms. Trefren. Based on your medical history and today’s examination, PrEP is not indicated. It sounds as though your concerns were unfounded, and you are right to be cautious about information you find online. Yes, you are all set to enjoy your bingo. However, I strongly encourage you to maintain regular check-ups with your primary care physician for continued monitoring of your health. And if any concerns do arise in the future, please don’t hesitate to seek medical attention. Do you have any further questions for me today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think that’s everything. You’ve put my mind at ease. Thank you for taking the time to listen to me, even if it was probably just silly worrying. And thank you for not laughing at me. I appreciate it. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have a bingo game to win!
DOCTOR: You're welcome, Ms. Trefren. Have a pleasant afternoon. .
