DOCTOR: Good morning, Mrs. Nini. I'm Dr. Hembrey. It's a pleasure to meet you. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Hmm… what did bring me in? Let me see… It’s something about the blood, I think. My… a friend, maybe? Suggested I find out what type I am. Something about… emergencies? It’s all a bit foggy, you see. I just want to know, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: I understand. You're interested in determining your blood type, perhaps due to some concerns about needing to know it in an emergency situation. That's a sensible precaution. To clarify, has anything specific prompted this concern now, or has this been on your mind for a while?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Now you're asking… I really don’t recall. It wasn't a specific thing, no. It just… felt like something I should do. Old age, I suppose. Things slip your mind, you know? I used to work with ropes, big ones… rigging, they called it. Maybe it's from that? Something about needing to know things for safety… but that's just a guess. It feels… important, but I can’t say why.
DOCTOR: Rigging… interesting. While a history of working with ropes is good to know, I’m not certain I follow the connection to needing to know your blood type. Regardless, it's perfectly reasonable to want this information for peace of mind. We can certainly determine that for you. Before we proceed with a blood draw, however, I'd like to ask a few routine questions, just to get a broader picture of your health. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course! Questions are fine. I’m not doing much these days, so I have time. Though… forgive me if I wander a bit. My memory isn’t what it used to be, you know. Ask away, Doctor. I’ll do my best to answer.
DOCTOR: Certainly. Let’s start with your medical history. Do you have any current medical conditions – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, arthritis, or anything else a doctor has diagnosed you with?
PATIENT: Oh dear… that’s a tricky one. Let me see… I used to have terrible headaches, years ago. But those… mostly faded with time. My knees ache a bit, now and then, but I think that’s just old age creeping in. And… oh! The doctor gave me something for my… water retention, I think. A little pill. But I stopped taking it, it made me feel… funny. I don’t really have anything, I suppose. Just the usual aches and pains of getting old. I had a good doctor back in… well, I can’t quite remember where anymore. He always knew what to do.
DOCTOR: Headaches in the past, intermittent knee pain, and a medication for water retention that you discontinued due to side effects. Do you recall the name of that medication?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no. I really don't. All those pills… they all look the same, you know? Little white things. My daughter used to keep track of them for me, but… she lives far away now. I just stopped taking it when it made me feel a bit… dizzy. It was years ago, I’m sure. I wouldn’t even know where to begin looking for the name. It’s best to forget it, really. It didn't agree with me.
DOCTOR: Alright, no problem. We can proceed without the medication name for now. Have you ever been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Hospitalized… hmm. Let me think. Years and years ago, when I was still living in Spain, I had a terrible bout of… the flu, I think? A very bad fever. I was in the hospital for a few days, but it was nothing serious. Just to get me back on my feet. And… oh! My appendix, I think? When I was quite young. But that was a very long time ago. I don't remember much about it, honestly. Just white walls and… nurses. It wasn't a pleasant experience, I can tell you that.
DOCTOR: A bout of the flu and an appendectomy in the past. Good to know. Have you ever had any surgeries other than the appendectomy?
PATIENT: Surgeries… oh dear. Now you’re really testing my memory! Let me think… I had my tonsils out when I was a little girl, I believe. And… oh! When I broke my wrist, years ago, I had to have it set. That wasn't much fun, either. They put it in a cast for weeks. But… I don’t think I’ve had any major surgeries. Just the small things, you know? Nothing to write home about. It was all a very long time ago. Really.
DOCTOR: Alright. Tonsillectomy and a wrist fracture with casting in the past. Now, moving on to family history… are your parents still living?
PATIENT: Oh, no, dear. My parents… they’ve been gone for a very long time. Both of them. My mother… she died when I was quite young, I think. And my father… he passed away many years later. I had a sister, too, but she’s gone now as well. I’m the last one, I believe. It’s a long time ago, you see. A very long time. I don’t remember much about their illnesses, if that makes sense. It was all so long ago. Mostly, I just remember… their smiles.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s perfectly alright that you don't recall specific details about their medical history. Now, regarding your social history… do you currently smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: Oh, no, dear. I’ve never smoked a day in my life. Not me. It’s a terrible habit, you see. My husband, bless his soul, he used to smoke a little, but he gave it up years ago. I always told him it was bad for his health, and he listened, eventually. I always preferred a good glass of wine with my dinner, that’s all. A little bit of red wine… that’s good for the heart, isn't it? Not like those nasty cigarettes. No, I’ve never smoked.
DOCTOR: Alright. No history of smoking. Do you drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, a little. As I said, a glass of red wine with my dinner. Not every night, mind you. Just… when I feel like it. It helps me relax, you see. And it goes so well with the food! But not too much, I assure you. I don’t want to get… unsteady. A small glass. That’s all. I don’t drink spirits or anything like that. Just the wine. A little bit of wine. Is that alright, Doctor? I hope that’s not too much.
DOCTOR: A small glass of red wine occasionally. That’s fine. And finally, are you allergic to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Allergies… let me think. I don’t think so, not really. I used to get a bit of a rash when I touched certain flowers, but that was when I was a little girl. Nothing serious. And… oh! Once, I ate some shellfish, and my lips got a little swollen, but it went away on its own. Nothing to worry about, I suppose. I don’t have any major allergies, thankfully. I can eat most things. I’m a fairly lucky woman, in that regard. Is that what you wanted to know, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Yes, that is very helpful, thank you. Now that I have a better understanding of your medical history, I’d like to perform a brief physical exam, if you’re comfortable with that. This will just involve listening to your heart and lungs, checking your blood pressure, and a quick look in your ears and throat. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course! Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgment. A little exam won’t hurt, will it? I always liked the doctors back home. They were very thorough. Go ahead, dear. I’m ready whenever you are. Just… please be gentle? My old bones aren’t what they used to be.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I will be as gentle as possible. If anything feels uncomfortable at any point, please let me know immediately. Now, if you could just have a seat here on the table… I’m listening to your heart and lungs now. Your heart rate is a little slow, but regular. I hear some mild crackles in the bases of your lungs, which could be due to a number of things, including age or previous illness. Nothing particularly concerning at this time. Your blood pressure is 130/80, which is slightly elevated but within an acceptable range for your age. Your ears appear clear. Your throat is clear, no signs of infection. Your pulse is good and regular. Everything appears within normal limits for your age. Now, to determine your blood type, I’ll need to draw a small sample of blood. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Oh, that all sounds… reasonable, dear. A little poke, you say? It doesn't sound too bad. Yes, go ahead and draw the blood. I’ve had blood drawn before, so I know what to expect. Just… try to be quick, if you could? I don't like needles, you see. But… it’s important to know, isn't it? So… go ahead. I’ll try to be brave. Just let me know when it’s over.
DOCTOR: Alright. I will be as quick and gentle as possible. We'll start with a quick tourniquet application. This will help to make your veins more prominent. I’ve found a good vein here. This might feel a little cold. Just a quick pinch… All done. Just hold pressure here for a few minutes to stop the bleeding. There you go. Please keep this bandage on for at least an hour. The sample will be sent to the lab for analysis. It should take approximately 24 to 48 hours to receive the results. In the meantime, is there anything else I can address for you today, Mrs. Nini?
PATIENT: Oh, that was… not so bad, actually. A little pinch, but nothing more. Thank you, dear. You were very gentle. No, I don't think so. Just the blood type, that’s all. I suppose I’ll just wait for the results then. 24 to 48 hours, you said? Alright. Thank you for your help, Doctor. You’ve been very kind. It’s nice to have a good doctor, you know. A little reassurance goes a long way. Do I need to come back to get the results, or will you call me?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mrs. Nini. I’m glad it wasn’t too uncomfortable. I’ll have the results sent to my office, and my staff will call you as soon as they’re available. We can discuss them over the phone, and schedule a follow-up appointment if needed. I’ll also make a note in your chart to ensure you receive a prompt call. Do you have any specific numbers where you prefer to be reached?
PATIENT: Oh, that sounds perfect, dear. A phone call is much easier for me these days. Let me see… the best number to reach me is 555-123-4567. It’s a little old, but it still works. My daughter set it up for me, you see. She worries about me. Yes, 555-123-4567. Please just ask for Mrs. Nini. I'll be waiting for the call. Thank you again, Doctor. You've been a great help.
DOCTOR: Alright, 555-123-4567 it is. My staff will be sure to contact you as soon as the results are available. It was a pleasure meeting you, Mrs. Nini. Please don’t hesitate to contact the office if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. Have a good day, and try not to worry.
