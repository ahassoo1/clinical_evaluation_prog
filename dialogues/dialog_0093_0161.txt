DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Trefren. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Eriberto Bakan. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Please, call me Helaina. Well, to be frank, a friend suggested I look into… preventative things. About HIV, you know? She said there’s a pill you can take before anything happens. I don’t really understand all the details, but that’s why I’m here. Trying to be sensible, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Helaina. That’s very sensible of you to be proactive about your health. Your friend is referring to pre-exposure prophylaxis, or PrEP. It’s a medication taken to prevent HIV infection. It’s an excellent option for individuals at risk. Before we discuss PrEP further, I’d like to gather a bit more information about your overall health and risk factors. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, absolutely. Whatever you need to know. I don’t have any major health problems, if that’s what you mean. Just the usual aches and pains for someone my age, I guess. Medicare covers everything, thankfully. I don’t… well, I haven’t been with anyone regularly in quite some time. Is that what you need to know? It’s a little personal, I realize.
DOCTOR: Not at all, Helaina. It’s important information, and you’re right to be open with me. I assure you, everything we discuss is confidential. Just to clarify, when you say not with anyone regularly, have you had any recent sexual encounters, even infrequent ones?
PATIENT: Well… let me think. There was… one time, maybe six months ago? It was just a one-off thing, with an old friend. We were both… reminiscing, and one thing led to another. It wasn't planned, and honestly, it was a bit awkward afterwards. We haven’t… repeated it. And before that? Nothing. Truly. I just… I worry about these things, you know? It’s better to be safe.
DOCTOR: I understand perfectly, Helaina. It’s very responsible of you to consider your health, and even a single encounter can warrant discussion of preventative measures. Now, let’s go through a brief review of your medical history, if you don't mind. Have you ever been diagnosed with any chronic medical conditions – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart disease?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. The doctor always says my blood pressure’s a little high when I’m at the office, but it’s always fine at home. She says it’s just nerves. Otherwise, I’m pretty healthy, knock on wood. I did have the flu a couple of years ago, a bad one, but I recovered just fine. And all my vaccinations are up to date, I think. My niece, she’s a nurse, she keeps track of all that for me.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear, Helaina. It sounds like you're generally in good health, and having a niece who is a nurse is very helpful! Now, regarding past surgical history – have you ever had any operations or surgeries?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Nothing major. I had my tonsils out when I was a child, a very long time ago. And I had a cyst removed from my wrist once, but it was just a small thing, outpatient. Nothing since then, not that I can recall. I’ve been lucky, I suppose. No broken bones or anything like that, thankfully.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent, Helaina. And what about your family history?
PATIENT: Well, my mother, she had… heart trouble, I think. She passed away when I was still quite young, so I don’t remember a lot of the details. My father was healthy as an ox, lived to be 95. He always said it was the olive oil. My brother, he has… arthritis, I believe. Nothing really serious. Honestly, we weren't a family that talked a lot about illnesses. It was more… just get on with things, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Helaina. It’s common for families to not discuss medical history in detail. That’s alright; we can work with what we have. Now, could you tell me about any allergies you may have?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. I’m allergic to penicillin. Gives me a terrible rash. And… dust. Not a serious allergy, but it makes me sneeze a lot. And I think I’m a little sensitive to cats, but I avoid them anyway. I don’t really like animals, to be honest. Just dust, penicillin, and… sometimes perfume, if it’s very strong. Nothing life-threatening, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Helaina. That’s good to know. And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Just… vitamins. A multivitamin, and sometimes Vitamin D in the winter. The doctor said I might be a little low. And… sometimes I take ibuprofen for my aches and pains, but not very often. Honestly, I try to avoid taking pills as much as possible. I don’t really trust them, if you know what I mean.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Helaina. Many people feel that way. Now, before we move on, let’s quickly discuss your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, no, none of that. Never smoked a day in my life. My mother smoked, and it wasn’t a pretty sight. I had a glass of wine with dinner occasionally, but I’ve cut back on that too. And definitely no drugs. Never been interested. I’m a very… sensible woman, you see.
DOCTOR: That’s very good to hear, Helaina. It sounds like you lead a very healthy lifestyle. Now, let’s move on to a brief physical exam, if you’re comfortable with that. I’d like to check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and just do a general assessment. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you need to do. The sooner we get this sorted, the better, really. I just want to make sure I’m doing the right thing. I don't want to be a bother, though.
DOCTOR: Not at all, Helaina. It’s my job, and I’m happy to do it. Please, have a seat here on the examination table. Your blood pressure is 138/82. A little elevated, but not significantly so. It's common to see a slight increase in a clinical setting. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. No wheezing or crackles detected. Your abdomen is soft and non-tender. Everything feels normal. Everything appears to be within normal limits, Helaina. Do you have any pain or discomfort anywhere that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No, no pain or discomfort. Just the usual aches and pains. My knees bother me sometimes, but that's just old age, I suppose. And my back, if I stand for too long. But nothing serious. Honestly, Doctor, I think I’m pretty healthy for my age.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, Helaina. Based on what you’ve told me and the brief physical exam, you appear to be in good health. Now, given your history and risk factors, PrEP could be a good option for you. It's highly effective at preventing HIV infection, and it’s generally very well-tolerated. However, before we start you on PrEP, we need to do some blood tests to make sure you don't have HIV already and to check your kidney function, as PrEP can affect the kidneys. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds sensible. Whatever tests you need to do, just let me know. I want to be absolutely sure, you see. I don't want to take anything unnecessarily. And… what exactly is involved in these tests? Will it be painful? I don't like needles, if I'm being honest.
DOCTOR: I understand your apprehension about needles, Helaina. It’s perfectly normal to feel that way. The blood tests are quite routine. We’ll just need a small sample of blood, drawn from your arm. It’s a quick pinch, and it’s over very quickly. We'll send the sample to the lab, and the results should be back within a few days. The tests will check for HIV antibodies, screen for other sexually transmitted infections, and assess your kidney and liver function to make sure you're a good candidate for PrEP. If everything looks good, we can discuss starting the medication. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, alright. As long as it’s quick. And if anything is wrong, you’ll let me know, right? I don't want any surprises. I’m a little anxious about all this, to be honest. It’s just… a lot to take in.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Helaina. I will explain everything clearly and thoroughly, and I will let you know the results as soon as they are available. If anything is abnormal, we will discuss it in detail and develop a plan together. You have no need to worry. I'll also give you some pamphlets to review after the visit with additional information about PrEP. Now, I'll have the nurse draw your blood. She's very gentle and experienced. After that, we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results and, if appropriate, start you on PrEP. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… good. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything so carefully. I feel a little better now, knowing what to expect. Just… please tell the nurse I don’t like needles.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Helaina. I will let her know. I understand your apprehension, and she will be as gentle as possible. I’ll leave you to the nurse now. She’ll be in shortly. And please don’t hesitate to ask any further questions that come to mind. We’ll get through this together.
PATIENT: .
