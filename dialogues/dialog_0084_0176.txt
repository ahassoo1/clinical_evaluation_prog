DOCTOR: Good morning, Ivette. I'm Dr. Voytek. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s these hiccups. They just… won’t stop. It’s been over two days now, and it's getting really annoying.
DOCTOR: Okay, hiccups for over two days. That is annoying. Can you tell me a little more about them?
PATIENT: Sure. They come and go, mostly after I eat, but sometimes just… randomly. They’re pretty strong, not little tiny ones. And they’ve been happening all day, every day since… let me think… Tuesday, I think it was. I tried holding my breath, drinking water upside down, all the usual things, but nothing seems to work.
DOCTOR: Alright. So they started Tuesday, are triggered by eating sometimes, but also happen randomly, and the usual home remedies aren’t helping. You said they’re strong. Are they interfering with anything—like sleeping, eating, or just generally getting through your day?
PATIENT: Yes, actually. Sleeping is hard, because every time I start to drift off, hic… one comes and wakes me up. And eating is a bit awkward, you know? Trying to enjoy a meal while hic… constantly hiccupping isn’t very pleasant. It’s just… tiring, really. I manage my little entertainment place, and it’s hard to concentrate when I’m hic… constantly startled by them.
DOCTOR: Okay, so disrupted sleep and difficulty concentrating at work. Have you noticed anything else happening at the same time as the hiccups?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No, not really. No fever, no pain anywhere… I haven’t been feeling sick, just… hiccupy. Maybe a little heartburn after I eat, now that I think about it. But I get that sometimes anyway, you know? It's not new.
DOCTOR: Okay, no other symptoms besides the hiccups and some occasional heartburn. Let's talk about your medical history for a moment. Do you have any medical conditions that you're aware of?
PATIENT: Not really. I had my gallbladder out years ago, and I used to have high blood pressure, but it's been under control for a long time with diet and exercise. Nothing else that I can think of, and I don't take any regular medication. Oh, and I’m divorced, if that matters. Is that what you mean?
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder removal, controlled hypertension. No current medications. And thank you for sharing, but your marital status doesn't matter for this visit. Now, any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies, no. I can eat anything, take most medicines without a problem. I’m pretty lucky that way, actually. I remember being stung by a bee once as a child, but it was just a local reaction. Nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. And finally, before we move on to a quick exam, do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, no, and no. Never smoked a day in my life. I might have a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, but that’s it. Very occasionally. And I definitely don’t do any… recreational things. I run a business, you know? I need to keep a clear head.
DOCTOR: Alright. That's good to know. Now, let's just listen to your heart and lungs, and I'll feel your abdomen. It's just a quick check to rule out anything obvious. If you could just lie down on the table for me, please.
PATIENT: Okay, sure. It’s just… I always feel a bit silly lying down for hiccups. But whatever you need.
DOCTOR: Okay, your heart and lungs sound clear. Your abdomen is soft, no tenderness. I don't feel any masses. While this isn’t definitive, it doesn't seem like there’s anything immediately concerning physically. Given the duration and the fact that home remedies haven't helped, and given the occasional heartburn, I’d like to consider a few things. Have you had any changes to your diet recently?
PATIENT: Yes, actually! My niece came to visit last week and we did a lot of cooking. Egyptian food, mostly. Lots of spices, and richer, heavier things than I usually eat. Things like stuffed grape leaves, mahshi, and ful medames. Delicious, but… not exactly light fare. Could that be it?
DOCTOR: Okay, increased intake of richer foods and spices. That’s helpful to know. It’s possible the change in diet is irritating your esophagus, triggering the hiccups. Occasionally, persistent hiccups can be a sign of something more serious, but given your history and the recent dietary change, let’s start with a trial of a medication to reduce stomach acid. I'm going to prescribe you a proton pump inhibitor – PPI - for two weeks. It's a pretty common medication. If the hiccups don’t improve after two weeks, or if you develop any other symptoms like difficulty swallowing, chest pain, or weight loss, please come back immediately, okay?
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds good. A proton pump inhibitor… PPI. I’ll try that. Two weeks. And come back if they don’t stop, or if something else happens. Got it. Is there anything I should do differently while I’m taking it? Like, avoid certain foods?
DOCTOR: Yes. While on the PPI, try to avoid very spicy foods, caffeine, alcohol, and carbonated beverages. Also, eat smaller, more frequent meals. The paper I’m printing has detailed instructions and a list of foods to avoid. We’ll also want to monitor your symptoms. If they worsen despite the medication, it is vital to follow-up. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Okay, smaller meals, avoid spicy stuff… and caffeine. I can manage that. No, I think that covers everything. Thank you, Doctor Voytek. I really appreciate you taking the time to listen. Hopefully, this will finally get rid of these hiccups! They’re driving me crazy.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ivette. I understand your frustration. Hopefully, the PPI will do the trick. The front desk can schedule a follow-up appointment for two weeks if you’d like, or we can do that over the phone. And remember, don’t hesitate to call if anything changes. Have a good day, and I hope you feel better soon. .
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. I will. I think I'll just schedule a follow-up now, just in case. Goodbye. And thank you again!
