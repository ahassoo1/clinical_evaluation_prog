DOCTOR: Well, hello Kahrin. It’s nice to meet you. I’m Dr. Asami. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Right, hi Doctor. Just the results, please. I’m pretty busy, so if we could just get straight to it, that’d be great. I remember everything the nurse told me about the tests, so I don’t need a rehash.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Kahrin. I understand you’re pressed for time, and you recall the details from the nurse. Let’s get right to it then. I have your lab results here, and we can discuss them. Before we dive in, just to confirm, you were seen for some fatigue and some… abdominal discomfort, is that right?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s it. Mostly just tired all the time, and a bit of a stomach ache now and then. Not a big stomach ache, just…uncomfortable. Is it bad?
DOCTOR: Okay. Well, the good news is that your complete blood count looks generally normal – no sign of anemia or infection there. Your thyroid levels are also within the normal range, so that rules out a thyroid issue as a cause for the fatigue. However, your Vitamin D level is quite low. And your comprehensive metabolic panel shows slightly elevated liver enzymes – not drastically high, but enough to warrant a closer look. It's not necessarily bad right now, but it does indicate something is going on with your liver that we need to investigate further. Do you have any known history of liver problems, Kahrin?
PATIENT: No, nothing at all. Never been sick, really, except for the usual colds. I don't drink much, maybe a glass of wine with dinner once a month? And I definitely don’t do any drugs. I eat pretty healthy, too… mostly fish and fruit. What does low Vitamin D even mean?
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, very helpful. As for the Vitamin D, it's a vitamin your body makes when exposed to sunlight. It’s important for bone health and also plays a role in your immune system. Many people are low in Vitamin D, especially if they don’t get a lot of sun exposure or if they have darker skin. It can contribute to fatigue, muscle aches, and even mood changes. The slightly elevated liver enzymes… that's a little more concerning, though not necessarily alarming. It could be a number of things. Sometimes it’s just a temporary reaction to something you ate, or a mild viral infection we aren’t even aware of. But because it's persistently elevated, we need to figure out what’s causing it. Do you recall anything unusual you might have eaten or been exposed to around the time of the blood test?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Around August 1st? I went to that new poke bowl place, “Island Fresh”, with my friend, Leilani. It was really good, but maybe… I don’t know. Nothing else really stands out. I haven’t been travelling or tried any new medications or anything. And no, I haven’t been around anyone sick. We had a luau on July 28th, but everyone seemed fine. Oh! Wait… I did try that new brand of seaweed snacks last week. They were… extra salty?
DOCTOR: Okay, "Island Fresh" poke bowl and the new seaweed snacks… those are helpful leads. Sometimes certain foods can temporarily raise liver enzymes, and seaweed can, in rare cases, contain heavy metals that could affect the liver. It’s good you remembered those details. To get a better picture, I’d like to order a few more blood tests. We'll check a more detailed liver panel, to see exactly which enzymes are elevated and by how much, and also rule out some other potential causes like viral hepatitis. We should also check your iron levels, just to be thorough. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, okay, that sounds… fine. As long as it doesn’t take forever. And I don’t have to come back a million times. How long will those results take?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns about time, Kahrin. I’ll put in the orders immediately. The lab usually takes about 3-5 business days to process these tests. So, you should have results back by the end of next week, at the latest. If anything comes back urgently abnormal, the lab will notify me immediately, and we’ll discuss it right away. In the meantime, I’d recommend avoiding the seaweed snacks and perhaps limiting raw fish for a little while, just to see if that helps bring the enzymes down. And I'm going to suggest a Vitamin D supplement, 2000 IU daily, to start. Does that sound reasonable to you?
PATIENT: Yeah, okay. No seaweed, more Vitamin D. Got it. And... I guess I'll just wait for the call. Is there anything else I need to do? Or any forms I need to fill out? I really do need to get going soon.
DOCTOR: No, no additional forms at this time. Just the blood tests and the Vitamin D supplement. I'll have the lab order printed out for you now, with instructions on where to go. And just to be safe, if you develop any new symptoms – like yellowing of your skin or eyes, dark urine, or severe abdominal pain – please call my office immediately. It’s unlikely, but it’s always best to be cautious. Here's the lab order. Do you have any questions before you go?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Thanks, Doctor. Hopefully, it’s just the seaweed. I really appreciate you getting this done quickly.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Kahrin. I understand your concerns, and we’ll get to the bottom of this. It very well could be something simple like the seaweed. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns at all. Have a good day, and I hope you feel better soon.
