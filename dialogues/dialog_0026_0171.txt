DOCTOR: Good morning, Lacreasha. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Finco. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Uh, yeah, nice to meet you too, I guess. It’s my nails. They just… look funny. Not good funny, bad funny. They changed. I don't remember when exactly, but they’re not right.
DOCTOR: Okay, your nails… they’ve changed. And you’re not sure when this started?
PATIENT: No, not really. A while ago, I think. Maybe last year? Or the year before? Time… it all just kinda blurs together, ya know? They used to be… normal. Now they’re… patchy, and kinda thick. It’s gross. I don’t do nails, never have. So it’s not like I got a bad manicure or somethin’.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's perfectly alright if you're not certain about the timing. Those changes you’re describing – patchy and thick – are good things for us to investigate. Just to get a clearer picture, could you describe the patches?
PATIENT: Hmm. Okay… well, it’s not like… spots. It’s more like… the color is different. Some parts are kinda white-ish, and some are… yellow. Not a bright yellow, more like a dingy yellow, if that makes sense. And they’re not smooth, like they used to be. They feel… rough when I run my hand over them. It’s weird. I don’t do anything with my hands, really. Just… normal stuff.
DOCTOR: Okay, patchy discoloration – white and yellowish hues – and a rough texture. And this is happening on all of your nails, or just some?
PATIENT: Oh, it's all of 'em. Every single one. Not just one or two, all ten. It’s kinda… embarrassing, really. I wear gloves a lot now, just to hide 'em. Don’t want people lookin’ at my hands, ya know? It's probably nothin', but it just… bothers me.
DOCTOR: I understand it’s bothersome, and it’s perfectly reasonable to want to address something you're self-conscious about. Since it’s affecting all of your nails, it's good we're taking a look. Now, have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Other changes? Let me think... Hmm. They hurt sometimes. Not all the time, just when I… I don't know… when I push on 'em, maybe? Or if I bump 'em against somethin’. Not like a sharp pain, just a dull ache. And… they seem kinda brittle. Like they could break really easy. I dropped a can yesterday and one almost snapped. Scared me half to death. That's… pretty much it, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, some tenderness with pressure, and increased brittleness. And this has been happening alongside the color and texture changes, roughly the same amount of time?
PATIENT: Yeah, pretty much. It all started around the same time, I think. It’s all just… a mess. Honestly, I don’t know what I even do to cause this. I don't go diggin' in the garden or nothin'. I mostly just stay inside. Maybe it's somethin' I'm eatin'? I don't really pay attention to that kinda stuff. My sister always tells me I should, but… she’s just a worrywart.
DOCTOR: It's good you're thinking through potential causes. We’ll try to figure this out together. Let’s talk a bit about your general health. Do you have any other medical conditions that you’re aware of?
PATIENT: Uh… not really. I got my blood pressure checked at the pharmacy last year and it was… okay, I guess. They didn’t say nothin’ about it bein’ bad. I don’t go to the doctor much, never really needed to. Just the usual check-ups when I was younger. I take a little somethin’ for my… bones. The doctor said I was gettin’ a little weak, so she gave me a pill for it. I forget what it’s called. It’s… white. Small white pill. Does that help? I’m not good with names and numbers and stuff. It all just… goes in one ear and out the other.
DOCTOR: Okay, so generally healthy, with some concern for bone weakness addressed with medication – a small, white pill. We'll try to look that up in your record later. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmm… Let me think. Not that I know of. I’ve never really had a bad reaction to anything. I can eat pretty much whatever. I mean, I don’t like shellfish, but that’s just a preference, not an allergy. I don't really get sick much either. Maybe a little cold every now and then, but that's it. I'm pretty tough, I think. Always been. I don’t get bothered by much.
DOCTOR: That's good to know. Alright. Now, before we do a quick physical exam of your hands, let’s briefly talk about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family history… oh boy. My family’s a mess. Everyone’s got somethin’. My mother had… somethin’ with her heart. I think. She was always sick. My sister has… diabetes, I think that's it. And my brother… he had problems with his stomach. But honestly, I don’t really pay attention to all that. It’s always somethin’ with someone. Everyone’s complainin’ about aches and pains. I try to stay away from it all, ya know? Too much worry. It'll just make things worse. I don't want to know, really. I’m probably forgettin’ half of it anyway. It’s all just… a blur.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's alright if you're not certain about the details. Alright. Now, if you don't mind, I’d like to take a quick look at your hands. Just to get a better idea of what’s going on. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yeah, okay. Go ahead. They're probably lookin’ awful, I can tell ya that much. I’ve been hidin’ them under gloves for weeks now. Don't judge me too harshly, okay? They’re not usually this bad. I swear.
DOCTOR: Not at all, Lacreasha. I’m not here to judge. Just to help figure out what's going on. Okay. I see the patchy discoloration you described, the white and yellowish areas. And the texture is definitely rougher than usual. I'm also feeling some slight thickening of the nails. There's a bit of tenderness when I press on the nail beds, but not severe. It doesn't appear to be inflamed, so that's a good sign. It appears there is some onycholysis—that means the nail is separating from the nail bed—though it’s mild. Does anything specifically make the tenderness worse?
PATIENT: Onycho-what-now? Sounds scary. And no, not really. It just… hurts sometimes when I do somethin’ with my hands. Like… washin’ dishes or somethin’. Or if I bump 'em. It’s just a dull ache, nothin’ sharp. It's not like a throbbing pain or nothin'. I try to be careful, ya know? I don't want to make it worse. That’s why I wear gloves. I just wanna know what’s goin’ on. Is it somethin’ serious? Am I gonna lose my nails? That'd be awful. I need my hands.
DOCTOR: Onycholysis just means the nail is lifting slightly from the skin underneath. It sounds scary, but it's often not serious. We need to determine why it's happening. And you're not likely to lose your nails, but we want to address this to prevent any further issues. It's good you're being careful. Now, sometimes this can be caused by a fungal infection, or it could be related to a nutritional deficiency, or even something as simple as repeated trauma. To get a better idea of what's going on, I'd like to order a couple of tests. First, a nail fungus culture to rule out infection. And a blood test to check for any vitamin or mineral deficiencies. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Tests? Oh boy. I hate tests. But… I guess I gotta do 'em, right? If it's gonna help figure out what’s goin’ on. A fungus… ew. I don't want no fungus. And a blood test… I always get nervous with needles. But okay. Do what ya gotta do. Just… be quick, okay? And don’t poke me too much. I bruise easy. My sister says I have paper skin. Honestly, I just wanna get this over with. Is it gonna hurt bad?
DOCTOR: I understand your nervousness. We’ll take it slow and be as gentle as possible. The blood draw will just be a standard test, and the phlebotomist is very experienced. They'll do their best to make it quick and painless. The nail fungus culture is also painless—it just involves taking a small scraping from your nails. We’ll get the orders sent to the lab, and they’ll contact you to schedule the tests. Once we have the results, we'll discuss them and come up with a plan. In the meantime, continue wearing gloves to protect your nails and avoid any activities that might cause trauma to them. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s it. Just… hurry up with the results, okay? I don’t like havin’ to worry about this. And thank you… for not laughin’ at my nails. My sister would tease me for days if she saw 'em. She’s always gotta have perfect everything. I just wanna get back to normal. Can I go now? I gotta go make dinner. My cat’s gettin' hungry. She's a demanding little thing.
DOCTOR: Of course. We’ll get the results back as quickly as possible. And you absolutely can go. It was nice meeting you, Lacreasha. I'm happy to help, and I'm glad I didn't laugh at your nails – they're just nails, and we'll figure out what's going on. Here's my card with the clinic number. Call if you have any questions or concerns before your results come in. And give your cat a pat from me. Have a good evening.
PATIENT: Okay, thank you. I will. .
