DOCTOR: Right. Lucia Fogelstrom, 38 years old. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It's... the belching. I keep belching. It’s been happening for a few weeks now. It's not painful, exactly, just… annoying. And a lot.
DOCTOR: Belching, alright. A few weeks, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, maybe four weeks? It comes and goes, but mostly it's… there. More after I eat, I think. Not every time, but a lot of the times. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: After eating. Right. And what do you typically eat?
PATIENT: Oh… um. Everything, I guess? I try to eat healthy. Rice and beans a lot. Chicken sometimes. Salads. But I also like… you know, a little bit of everything. Pizza now and then. I don't really have a special diet. Why does it matter?
DOCTOR: It matters because some foods are more likely to cause… issues. Pizza, for example, isn't exactly known for being gentle on the digestive system. But let’s try to be thorough. When you say “a lot,” how many times a day are we talking about?
PATIENT: Oh… hmm. It’s hard to say. Maybe… ten times? Sometimes more. Maybe fifteen if I eat something heavy. It's embarrassing to talk about, really. It happens even when I don't eat a lot of food, sometimes. Just a little bit and poof – belch. It's not constant, but it's… frequent.
DOCTOR: Frequent, after meals, sometimes even with small portions. Alright. And are you experiencing any other symptoms alongside the belching?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Hmm… Not really. I feel… okay. Maybe a little bit of… bloating sometimes? But not always. And… I guess I feel a little tired, but everyone is tired, right? I don’t know if that’s from the belching, though. It's just… general tiredness. Nothing bad.
DOCTOR: Bloating…and general tiredness. Do you have any heartburn or indigestion?
PATIENT: Heartburn? Sometimes. Not every time, but yeah, sometimes after I eat something spicy. Or… pizza. Pizza seems to be causing a lot of problems, huh? It’s not bad, just… a burning feeling. It doesn't happen every time I eat, though. Maybe once or twice a week.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, belching, bloating, tiredness, occasional heartburn, related to meals… and specifically after spicy foods and pizza. Have you noticed any particular triggers besides those?
PATIENT: Hmm… That’s a good question. Not really. I mean, I drink soda sometimes, but I don’t think that does it. And I don’t eat anything… weird. Not like, really fatty or anything. Maybe… when I’m stressed? I think maybe when I’m really worried about something, it gets worse. But I’m always a little worried, so it's hard to tell.
DOCTOR: Stress can certainly play a role. Let's do a quick exam, alright?
PATIENT: Okay. That sounds… good. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. What will you do?
DOCTOR: I’ll listen to your abdomen with my stethoscope, and I'll palpate it gently to check for any tenderness. It's fairly straightforward. Please lie down on the table. If you don't mind, could you please change into a gown?
PATIENT: Okay, yes. I can do that. Is it okay if I leave my underwear on? I'm… a little shy.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s acceptable. Please just lie down when you’re ready.
PATIENT: Okay… Thank you, Doctor. I’ll be right back.
DOCTOR: Alright. When you're ready, please lie flat on your back with your arms at your sides. I’m going to listen to your abdomen now.
PATIENT: Okay. Here. I'm ready. Is it cold? I always get cold easily.
DOCTOR: Alright. Breathe normally. Sounds within normal limits. No evidence of increased bowel sounds or any abnormal noises. Any tenderness here?
PATIENT: No, not really. A little… pressure, but not pain. It feels normal. Oh, maybe there… a little bit. But it's not bad. Just a little… uncomfortable. Is something wrong?
DOCTOR: Slight tenderness in the right upper quadrant. Not acute, but present. Normal bowel sounds. Mild tenderness to palpation. It's unlikely anything serious, but your symptoms, combined with this tenderness, suggest… possible mild gastritis, or perhaps some degree of functional dyspepsia. Do you have any history of ulcers or similar issues in your family?
PATIENT: Ulcers? Um… my grandmother had something… stomach problems, I think. But I don’t know if it was ulcers. She was very old, and she had a lot of problems. I don't think anyone else… not that I know of. Does that mean something is wrong with me? Is it serious? I get worried easily.
DOCTOR: It’s unlikely to be serious, but we need to rule some things out. Your symptoms could be due to a variety of factors. Given your age and the examination findings, I suspect it’s most likely a mild digestive issue, aggravated by stress and potentially your dietary choices. However, to be certain, I’d like to order a basic blood workup, including a complete blood count and some liver function tests. And, I’d recommend a stool test to rule out any infection.
PATIENT: Okay. Blood work… and a stool test. That sounds… unpleasant. But okay, if you think it’s necessary. Will it take long to get the results? And will it be expensive? I don’t have insurance, you know.
DOCTOR: The tests are relatively standard. The blood work will take a couple of days, and the stool test results should be back within a week. As for the cost… The blood work will be around $150, and the stool test about $80. I can write you a prescription for the tests, and you can pay for them at the lab. It's important to get these tests done, so we have a clear picture of what's going on. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding spicy foods, carbonated beverages, and anything that seems to trigger your symptoms. And try to manage your stress levels. Here are the requisitions for the tests. Let’s see what the results show, and then we can discuss a more specific plan.
PATIENT: Okay… $230. That's… a lot of money. I’ll have to see if I can borrow some. But okay. I’ll try. I’ll go to the lab. And I’ll try to avoid spicy food. And soda. And… I’ll try to be less stressed. Thank you, Doctor. Is there anything else I need to do? Or know?
DOCTOR: No, I don’t believe so. Just get the tests done as soon as possible. And if your symptoms worsen – if you experience severe abdominal pain, vomiting, or blood in your stool – go to the emergency room immediately. Otherwise, we’ll discuss the results when they come back. You can schedule a follow-up appointment with the receptionist when you’re leaving. .
