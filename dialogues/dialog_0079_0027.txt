DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Altine. I am Dr. Gonzalezperez. It says here you’re 67 years of age. Now, could you tell me in your own words what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Look, I don't have all day, so let's just get to it. It's this… stuff. Coming up. Regurgitation, the paper says. Feels awful. Happens mostly after I eat, especially if it’s something rich. Honestly, it's disgusting, and my wife keeps complaining about the smell. That's why I’m here.
DOCTOR: “Regurgitation,” yes. I see. And you say it occurs primarily after meals, particularly those… heavier in nature. Can you describe this “stuff” to me?
PATIENT: Heavier, yes. Like a good steak! Not that rabbit food. And the stuff? It’s… well, it’s my food, mostly. Undigested. Looks like I barely chewed it. Sometimes it’s sour, burns going up. It's not pleasant. Really, you should know what regurgitation looks like, shouldn't you? It's not exactly a secret ailment.
DOCTOR: Indeed, I am familiar with the presentation of regurgitation, Mr. Altine. However, a precise description from you is invaluable. The sour taste you mention – does that occur with every episode, or only some?
PATIENT: Look, are we going to play twenty questions? It's not always sour, alright? Sometimes it just… comes up. Like a wave. More often after something… flavorful. Like Italian. Or Mexican. Never happens with plain boiled chicken, if that tells you something. Honestly, I think my stomach just doesn't like good food.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Altine. It seems to be correlated with richer, more seasoned foods. Now, aside from the unpleasant sensation and the odor, are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Well, sometimes my chest feels… tight. Not like a heart attack, mind you, just… uncomfortable. And a bit of heartburn, now and then. But I take those little antacid tablets, so that usually sorts it out. Nothing major. I just want this… coming up… to stop. It’s embarrassing, and frankly, it ruins a good meal.
DOCTOR: Chest tightness and heartburn, relieved by antacids. Good. Have you noticed any difficulty swallowing, Mr. Altine?
PATIENT: Difficulty swallowing? No. I eat like a horse. Always have. Never had a problem getting food down, just getting it to stay down, apparently. Look, I'm a big guy, I need to eat. It's not like I'm sipping broth all day.
DOCTOR: Very well. I'm just trying to gather all the necessary information. Now, I’m going to gently palpate your abdomen. Please let me know if you experience any tenderness. Does this cause any discomfort?
PATIENT: Oof! Watch it, Doc! Don’t poke so hard. It's a little tender… right there. That’s where it feels… unsettled. Not painful, exactly, just… not right. Like there's pressure. Honestly, you’re probably just making it worse now.
DOCTOR: Tenderness to palpation in the upper abdomen. I see. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a few deep breaths.
PATIENT: Just get it over with. There. Happy now? Honestly, I'm a perfectly healthy man. It's just this… coming up… business. And my wife's complaining.
DOCTOR: Your heart and lungs sound clear. Now, do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. Never had allergies. I’m a tough Polish guy, we don't get allergies. Though, I don't take much in the way of medication. Those antacids, when I need them. That’s about it. Really, I prefer to just tough things out.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Altine. Based on your description and the brief examination, it sounds as though you may be experiencing gastroesophageal reflux disease, or GERD, with associated esophagitis. The regurgitation, heartburn, chest tightness – they all fit the pattern. However, to be certain, I'd like to order a few tests.
PATIENT: Tests? Honestly, I thought you said it sounds like… something. Why do I need tests? I’m telling you what’s wrong! It’s my stomach, not liking rich food. It's simple. Look, I haven't got time for a lot of poking and prodding. Are you trying to run up the bill?
DOCTOR: Mr. Altine, while your self-diagnosis may be plausible, it is my professional responsibility to rule out other potential causes of your symptoms. Specifically, I’d like to order an upper endoscopy to visualize your esophagus and stomach, and a pH monitoring test to measure the acidity in your esophagus. These tests will allow us to definitively confirm the diagnosis and rule out any complications, such as Barrett's esophagus. It's not about running up a bill, it's about providing you with the best possible care.
PATIENT: Barrett’s… what? Look, are these going to be unpleasant? I don't do well with unpleasant things. And how long will this take? I have a golf game next Tuesday. Honestly, this sounds like a lot of fuss over something that’s just… food coming back up. You're making this much harder than it needs to be. Just give me something to stop it, alright?
DOCTOR: The endoscopy involves inserting a thin, flexible tube with a camera into your esophagus. It’s generally well-tolerated, and we’ll provide sedation to keep you comfortable. The pH monitoring involves placing a small capsule into your esophagus that measures acidity levels for 24 hours. It’s also relatively painless. As for a medication to stop it immediately, I can prescribe a proton pump inhibitor, or PPI, which will reduce acid production and likely alleviate your symptoms. However, it's important to determine the underlying cause of your condition to prevent long-term complications. Would you be willing to proceed with the tests and a trial of PPI medication?
PATIENT: Fine. But if this messes up my golf game, I’m holding you responsible. And I want the strongest PPI you’ve got. None of that weak stuff. And… is this going to make me sleepy? I have important meetings, you know.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Altine. I will order a prescription for omeprazole, 40mg daily, which is a potent PPI. It can sometimes cause mild drowsiness, but most patients tolerate it well. We will schedule the endoscopy for the earliest possible date that does not conflict with your golf game. I’ll also provide you with detailed instructions on how to prepare for the endoscopy and a list of potential side effects. Do you have any other questions at this time?
PATIENT: No. Just get it done. And tell your nurse to make the appointment quickly. I've got things to do. Look, I appreciate you… trying to help. But honestly, this whole thing is a bit of a hassle.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Altine. I’ll have the nurse contact you shortly to schedule the endoscopy. In the meantime, please start taking the omeprazole as directed. If your symptoms worsen or you experience any unexpected side effects, do not hesitate to contact the office. Have a good day, Mr. Altine.
PATIENT: .
