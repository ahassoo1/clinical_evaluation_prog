DOCTOR: Good morning, Mirriam. It's nice to meet you. I'm Dr. Pfennig. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you, Doctor Pfennig. It’s lovely to meet you too. Well, it's these hiccups, you see. Been going on for… oh, goodness, nearly a week now! Not constantly, mind you, but they just keep coming back. It's a bit of a nuisance, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, a week of hiccups. That is a bit persistent. Can you tell me a little more about them?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. They don't really seem to be triggered by anything in particular. I haven't been eating too fast, or drinking anything fizzy. I was having a bit of a laugh with my granddaughter yesterday, and they started up then, but they've happened when I'm just sitting quietly, too. They're… normal hiccups, I suppose? Just those little jolts, you know. Not painful, just… startling. And tiring, after a while!
DOCTOR: Right, not associated with anything specific, and they aren’t painful, just bothersome. And they started, or at least you noticed them, about a week ago. Have you noticed anything else happening at the same time as the hiccups?
PATIENT: Oh, that's a good question, Doctor. Let me see… Well, now that you mention it, I have been feeling a bit… off. Not sick, exactly. Just… a little bit weaker than usual, I think. And maybe a little bit more tired than normal, even for an old lady like me! It's hard to say if it's connected to the hiccups, though. I've been sleeping alright, and eating okay. It's just a general feeling of… not being quite right. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. A general feeling of being "not quite right" alongside the hiccups and fatigue. Okay. Have you had any trouble breathing, or any chest pain with these hiccups?
PATIENT: Oh no, no trouble breathing at all, Doctor. And no chest pain, thank goodness. It’s just the… the jolting. It’s more annoying than anything. I can still walk around and do things, it doesn't stop me. I was a bit worried, though, because a week is a long time for hiccups, isn't it? My sister used to get them, and they’d usually go away after a few hours. She’d hold her breath, or drink water upside down… never worked for me, though!
DOCTOR: You’re right to be a little concerned about the duration. A week is a bit long for persistent hiccups. And it’s good to know you haven’t tried any home remedies yet. Let’s do a quick physical exam, just to get a better idea of what might be going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, that’s perfectly alright, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgement. I'm happy to do whatever you need. Just let me know if it's going to be uncomfortable, and I'll tell you straight away!
DOCTOR: Okay, great. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs first. Could you please take a deep breath for me?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Is that alright? I used to be quite good at breathing exercises, back when I was a psychiatric aide. We had some patients who needed a lot of help with that.
DOCTOR: Okay, good breath. Now another one. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally, although your breathing is a little shallow. I'm going to check your pulses now. Pulses are a little weak, but present in all extremities. Now, I'm going to take your blood pressure. Blood pressure is 110/70. And lastly, I'm going to just take a quick look in your ears and throat. Ears look clear, throat is clear. No obvious signs of infection.
PATIENT: Alright. Everything sounds… alright, doesn't it? Though I do feel a bit… faint sometimes, and you mentioned the weak pulses. Could that be connected to the tiredness and the hiccups, do you think? I’ve been drinking plenty of water, I assure you. It's just… I don't feel as strong as I used to. Is there something wrong with my heart?
DOCTOR: Okay, Mirriam. You’re right to be concerned, and it’s good you’re bringing these things up. Your heart sounds normal on examination, but the slightly weak pulses and shallow breathing, combined with the fatigue and prolonged hiccups, do warrant further investigation. While it may not be anything serious, we need to rule out a few possibilities. I'd like to order some blood work – a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a thyroid function test. We'll also do an EKG to get a better look at your heart rhythm. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Blood work… that sounds a bit serious, doesn’t it? But if you think it’s necessary, Doctor, then yes, alright. I trust your judgement. I just… I don’t want to be a bother. Will it take long? And will it hurt? I’m not very good with needles, you see.
DOCTOR: It's perfectly alright to be anxious, Mirriam. It's a standard precaution, and we'll make it as quick and comfortable as possible. The blood draw itself is usually very quick – just a few pinpricks, and then it's done. A nurse will be doing it, and they are very good at minimizing discomfort. It shouldn't take more than 15-20 minutes in total. I'm going to go ahead and put in the orders for the lab work now. Once the results are back – usually within a couple of days – we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, if you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath, dizziness, or if the hiccups worsen significantly, please don’t hesitate to call the clinic or go to the nearest emergency room. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds alright. A couple of days… I can manage that. And thank you for explaining everything so clearly, Doctor. It makes me feel a bit better knowing what’s going on. And I will definitely call if anything gets worse. Chest pain or shortness of breath… yes, I remember. Is there anything I should be doing in the meantime? Like, should I be resting more? Or avoiding certain foods?
DOCTOR: That's good to hear. For now, I wouldn't restrict your diet unnecessarily. Just continue to eat a healthy, balanced diet. As for resting, listen to your body. If you're feeling tired, definitely take it easy. Avoid strenuous activity until we have the lab results back. Staying hydrated is also important. I'm going to print out a sheet with instructions on aftercare for the blood draw. The nurse will go over it with you as well. Do you have any questions for me before we finish up?
PATIENT: No, I think you've covered everything beautifully, Doctor. You've put my mind at ease, thank you. It's good to know someone is taking this seriously. Just… thank you. I appreciate your kindness and patience. I suppose I'll just wait for the nurse now?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's right. The nurse, Sarah, will be in shortly to take your blood. She’s wonderful. It was a pleasure meeting you, Mirriam. And please, don’t hesitate to call if you have any concerns at all. We’re here to help. And remember, listen to your body. Have a good day, and we'll see you soon.
PATIENT: .
