DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Farson. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Rakosky. It's nice to meet you. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. It's...Farson, yes. Look, it's this bruising. It’s getting ridiculous. I’m on that blood thinner, you see, and I bump into things – normal things, a chair, the counter – and I end up looking like I’ve been in a fight. It’s embarrassing, frankly. And worrying.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Farson. It’s certainly concerning when bruising occurs easily, especially when you’re on a blood thinner. We’ll get to the bottom of this. Just to clarify, you’re saying that even minor bumps are causing significant bruising?
PATIENT: Significant is putting it mildly, Doctor. I barely touch something and a purple mark appears. It’s not normal. I used to be able to knock my shins, you know, get a little color, maybe. Now? It’s like my blood is made of water. And it lasts ages. Honestly, it's getting old. Very old.
DOCTOR: I see. And how long has this been happening, this increased bruising with minimal trauma?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness… let me think. It started… around maybe six months ago? It was slow at first, just noticing it a bit more. But the last couple of months, it’s gotten progressively worse. I just assumed it was part of getting older, to be honest. But my daughter – she's a practical one – insisted I come see someone. Said it wasn't right.
DOCTOR: That’s good of your daughter to encourage you to seek medical attention. It’s always wise to investigate changes in your body, especially when on medication. Six months of progressive bruising is definitely something we need to look into. Now, let's talk a little about your medical history. Do you have any other medical conditions that we should be aware of?
PATIENT: Well, aside from the usual aches and pains of getting… seasoned, not much. I had a bout of pneumonia a few years back, but recovered fully. Otherwise, generally healthy. I used to be very active, hiking, but these days I prefer a good book. And I’ve always been a bit thin, if that matters. Never been one to put on weight. My wife – God rest her soul – used to worry about it constantly.
DOCTOR: Thank you. Pneumonia a few years ago is good to know. And being generally healthy is a positive. Your weight – or lack thereof – could be relevant, so thank you for mentioning that. Have you ever had any surgical procedures?
PATIENT: Let me see... nothing major. Appendectomy when I was a boy, that's about it. And I've had a few moles removed over the years, but those were just little things. Nothing requiring a hospital stay, or anything like that. Mostly just preventative stuff, the dermatologist recommended it. You can’t be too careful with the sun, you know. Especially living where I do now.
DOCTOR: Good to know, Mr. Farson. No major surgeries are helpful to note. Now, thinking about your family… are there any medical conditions that run in your family – things like bleeding disorders, or perhaps a history of easy bruising in your parents or siblings?
PATIENT: Hmm. That's a good question. My mother, she was always a bit… delicate, I suppose. Bruised easily, even as a young woman. But it wasn’t anything serious. Just… she was a clutz, always bumping into things. My father was a very robust man, never sick a day in his life. And I don't believe either of them had any of those… bleeding problems, like you said. Nothing they ever talked about, anyway. We weren't a family that discussed medical things much. It was a different time.
DOCTOR: I understand. That’s helpful to know, even a history of a tendency to bruise easily in your mother. Now, could you tell me about any medications you're currently taking, including any over-the-counter drugs, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Right, the medications. Well, there’s the Coumadin, of course – that's the blood thinner. I take 5 milligrams every evening. And I take a multivitamin, a basic one. Nothing fancy. Sometimes I’ll take ibuprofen for aches and pains, but not very often. My doctor told me to be careful with that, given the Coumadin. And… that’s about it, really. I try to avoid pills as much as possible.
DOCTOR: Thank you. Knowing the Coumadin dosage is very important. And being mindful of the ibuprofen is good. Lastly, do you have any allergies to any medications or other substances?
PATIENT: No, thankfully, no allergies. That’s one good thing I can say. Never had a reaction to anything. Not even bee stings, or poison ivy. I'm quite fortunate in that regard. My wife, she was allergic to everything under the sun. It was a constant worry. But me? I’ve always been pretty resilient.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent to know, Mr. Farson. No known allergies is very helpful. Alright, Mr. Farson, let’s take a look at your records here. I see your primary care physician started you on Coumadin six months ago for atrial fibrillation. And I see some notes about a recent INR check… it was slightly elevated, but not drastically so. Now, I'd like to do a brief physical exam to get a better understanding of what's going on. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that sounds fine, Doctor. Elevated? What does that mean, exactly? Is that why I'm bruising? I always forget what these things mean. My doctor just tells me numbers, and I nod my head and pretend to understand. An exam sounds good. Get a look at things directly, that’s a good idea. Better than just talking about numbers, I suppose.
DOCTOR: It means the Coumadin is thinning your blood a little more than we might like, which can contribute to bruising. But it’s not the only possibility, so we need to investigate further. Alright. If you don’t mind, I’m going to take a look at your arms and legs to assess the bruising. And I'll also listen to your heart and lungs, and check your pulse. I'm noticing bruising on both arms, predominantly on the forearms, and some on your shins. The bruises appear to be in varying stages of healing – some are relatively new, a deep purple color, while others are fading to a brownish hue. There doesn't seem to be any swelling or tenderness to the touch. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Your pulse is also within the normal range. I am also noting you appear somewhat cachectic, meaning you have experienced some weight loss.
PATIENT: Cachectic, you say? Is that… bad? That's what my daughter said, actually. She said I looked thinner. I've just been… not as hungry, I suppose. Stress, maybe? Losing my wife was… difficult. And I haven’t been cooking much, just grabbing something simple. But that’s not the reason I’m bruising, is it? It’s the Coumadin, right? It’s thinning me out, along with the blood. It all sounds rather alarming when you put it that way. I’m starting to feel a bit uneasy, Doctor.
DOCTOR: It’s good you mentioned the decreased appetite and weight loss. While the Coumadin is likely playing a role, weight loss can contribute to easier bruising as you have less cushioning and support for your blood vessels. It’s not uncommon after a significant loss, and we need to address that as well. I’m not dismissing your concerns, Mr. Farson. It’s good we’re discussing everything openly. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to order a complete blood count and a comprehensive metabolic panel . These tests will help us assess your overall health, check your liver function, and rule out any other potential causes for the bruising. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Tests… yes, alright. Whatever it takes to figure out what’s going on. CBC, CMP… more numbers, I presume? I’ll try to remember them, but don’t feel bad if I don’t. My brain isn’t what it used to be. Liver function… is that something to be worried about? My wife had some liver issues towards the end… I don’t want to end up like her. But yes, go ahead and order the tests. And thank you, Doctor. You’re… being very thorough. More than my regular doctor, if I’m being honest.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Farson. And don’t worry about remembering the specific tests – I’ll explain the results to you in detail once they’re available. The CBC and CMP will give us a good baseline. I’m also going to order a PT/INR repeat, just to confirm your current Coumadin levels. We’ll check those again in a few days. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding any activities that could lead to falls or injuries. And please, continue to monitor yourself for any new bruising or bleeding. If you experience any significant bleeding – nosebleeds, bleeding gums, blood in your stool or urine – please go to the emergency room immediately. Does that sound clear?
PATIENT: Yes, clear enough. Avoid injury… easy enough, I suppose. Though I do enjoy a walk in the garden. No falls, no bumps… I can manage that. Monitor for bleeding… I will. Though I’m not entirely sure what “significant” bleeding looks like. A little nosebleed, is that bad? And what about the weight loss? Should I be seeing a nutritionist? Or just… trying to eat more? I don’t have much of an appetite, as I said. This is all rather overwhelming, Doctor. It’s like a cascade of problems, one thing leading to another.
DOCTOR: That’s a fair point about the “significant” bleeding – a small nosebleed is usually nothing to worry about, but anything that’s prolonged, heavy, or difficult to stop warrants immediate attention. Regarding the weight loss, I do think it would be beneficial to consult with a nutritionist. They can help you develop a meal plan that’s tailored to your needs and preferences, and address any underlying issues that might be contributing to your decreased appetite. I can provide you with a referral. In the meantime, try to focus on eating small, frequent meals throughout the day, even if you're not particularly hungry. And ensure you’re getting enough protein and calories. I'm writing a referral for you to see a nutritionist. They’ll be able to assess your dietary needs and provide personalized recommendations. I also want to rule out any other potential causes for the weight loss, so I'm going to order a thyroid panel as well. Here’s the referral. The nutritionist’s office will contact you to schedule an appointment. We’ll discuss the results of all these tests – the CBC, CMP, PT/INR, and thyroid panel – at your follow-up appointment next week. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Thyroid… that’s another one. It’s just… a lot, Doctor. It feels like my body is falling apart, one piece at a time. And to be honest, I'm a bit worried about the cost of all these tests. Medicare covers most things, but… I don’t want to end up with a huge bill. No, I don’t think I have any questions right now. Just… a lot to think about. Thank you, Doctor Rakosky. You’ve been very patient with me. And thorough, as I said. I appreciate it. I suppose I’ll see you next week.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Farson. And your concerns about the cost are valid. We’ll ensure all the tests are pre-authorized with Medicare, and our billing department will contact you if there are any issues. Remember, we’re taking a comprehensive approach to figure out what’s going on. It’s likely a combination of factors, and we’ll address them one by one. Please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. And most importantly, take care of yourself. It was a pleasure meeting you, Mr. Farson. I look forward to seeing you next week.
