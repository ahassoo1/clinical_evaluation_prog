DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Honcoop. I'm Dr. Press. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, I ain’t got all day. Just need a… a paper signed. Something about gettin’ somethin’ done… to my face. A procedure, they called it. Folks at the place said I gotta get you to say it’s alright. Don’t rightly recall all the details, to be honest. It’s… cosmetic. That’s what they said.
DOCTOR: Cosmetic, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, cosmetic. Look, I ain’t one for fussin’ over nothin’. Just… a little somethin’ to tighten things up, you understand? Not a big deal. I got things to do, Doctor. Important things. This whole thing is just… a formality, I reckon.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Honcoop. While I understand you're busy, a "formality" still requires some information from me to ensure it's appropriate and safe for you. Even cosmetic procedures carry risks. Do you recall where you're having this procedure done?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, no. Some place… over on Elm Street, I think? A nice lookin’ office. They had pictures… of folks lookin’ younger. That’s all I remember. It wasn’t cheap, I'll tell ya that much. Seems like a waste of time askin’ about where it is now, don’t it? I already had it scheduled.
DOCTOR: It doesn’t seem like a waste of time to me, Mr. Honcoop, when we’re talking about your health. And a procedure performed at an unknown facility…well, that’s concerning. Do you recall what they are planning to do to your face specifically?
PATIENT: Tightenin’, Doctor! I told you. Tighten the skin. Saggin’ a little, you see. Age does that to a fella. Not a complicated thing. They used… machines, I think? And creams. Fancy creams. Look, I ain’t a doctor, I just wanna get this signed and be on my way. Don’t need a whole lecture on… on skin.
DOCTOR: Mr. Honcoop, I appreciate you’re not looking for a lecture, but I need to understand what you’ve agreed to. "Tightening" can mean a great many things, some of which could be quite risky without proper medical oversight. Do you recall the name of the practice, or perhaps the name of the person who discussed this with you?
PATIENT: Honestly? No. A… a woman. Blonde, I think. Pleasant enough. She talked a lot about… collagen. And how it’d make me look ten years younger. That's about all I remember. Look, I’m a practical man. I saw the pictures, I paid the money. What more do you need to know? This is gettin’ ridiculous. I got appointments, Doctor. Important ones.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let me see if I can pull up anything in the system based on your name and the general location. It's possible they’ve filed something with your insurance, even if you're uninsured... though that's unlikely. Can you tell me when this appointment is scheduled?
PATIENT: Thursday, I think. This week. Thursday afternoon. Look, I don't keep calendars or nothin'. Just… Thursday. They called to confirm it a couple of days ago. That's all I know, I swear. This is… a waste of my time. Shouldn't you be lookin' at other patients? Folks who actually need doctorin'?
DOCTOR: Mr. Honcoop, even cosmetic procedures require a degree of medical responsibility. I’m trying to ensure you’re making an informed decision and that you're not putting yourself at risk. It's my professional obligation. Now, tell me, do you have any allergies to begin with?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. Never had no allergies. Dust, maybe. But who doesn’t sneeze at dust? Look, I’m a strong, healthy man. Never been sick a day in my life… well, not serious sick, anyway. This is… this is gettin’ me nowhere. I need a signature, not a life story request. .
DOCTOR: Mr. Honcoop, with all due respect, I am not comfortable signing off on a procedure when I have absolutely no information regarding the specifics, the facility, or even the practitioner performing it. It would be irresponsible, and potentially dangerous, for me to do so. I strongly advise you to postpone this appointment until you can provide me with the necessary details. Perhaps contact the facility and obtain a written consent form outlining the procedure, the risks involved, and the qualifications of the person performing it. Then we can discuss it further.
