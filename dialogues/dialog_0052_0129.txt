DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Hatchard. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Shely. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Honestly, it’s probably nothing, but my husband keeps fussing. Says I need to get it checked. It’s my… well, my stool. It’s black. Been happening for a bit now. I take those pain pills, you know, the ones for my arthritis, every day. Been taking them for years. Is that what this is about? I don't have time for a lot of poking and prodding, if you don't mind.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Ms. Hatchard. It’s good your husband is encouraging you to come in, and you’re right to have it checked. Black stool, or melena as we call it, can indicate a number of things, and it’s important we investigate. It’s certainly possible it’s related to your pain medication, but we need to rule out other potential causes. To start, could you tell me a little more about this?
PATIENT: Oh, “melena,” fancy. Look, I'm a mechanic, not a doctor. I fix trucks, I don't memorize names for… output. It's black, like… tar, almost. And it smells… well, it smells like… well, you know. It's been happening on and off for maybe a month? Hard to say exactly, I don’t spend that much time analyzing it, if you get my drift. And it’s not like I’m bleeding buckets or anything. Just… dark. Is that enough information for you, or do you need a detailed report on my bathroom habits?
DOCTOR: No, Ms. Hatchard, that’s perfectly adequate for now. And please, don’t feel embarrassed. It’s my job to ask these questions, and you've described it very well. "Tar-like" is a helpful description. The fact that it's been happening on and off for about a month is important. Now, have you noticed any other changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Changes? Well, I'm 73, things change. What do you expect? But alright, alright… Let me think. It's usually… firm. Not loose, not watery. And I go… regularly. Once a day, mostly. Sometimes twice if I've had a good prune. Honestly, it's pretty boring. No pain, no cramping, no nothing. Just… dark stool. I'm telling you, it's probably just those pills. They mess everything up, those things. Do you need to know what brand they are? I can tell you, it's the orange ones.
DOCTOR: Orange pills… alright. Knowing the brand would be helpful, Ms. Hatchard, but we can get that later if needed. The fact that you don't have any pain or cramping is reassuring. You mentioned they mess everything up – have you noticed any other side effects from the medication besides the stool color?
PATIENT: Honestly? Yes. My stomach bothers me sometimes. A little heartburn, mostly. And I get… well, a bit sluggish, you know? Tired. But that's just getting old, isn't it? I could blame the pills, but I suspect it’s more the garden. Digging around in the dirt all day. It's hard work, even for a strong woman like me. And my hands ache something awful. But that’s the arthritis, obviously. Are we getting anywhere with this stool business, or are we just going to list every ailment I have? Because, believe me, there’s a list.
DOCTOR: You’re very thorough, Ms. Hatchard, and it’s good you’re so aware of your body. It is helpful to know all of this. The heartburn and sluggishness are things we should consider, yes. To be certain, I'd like to do a quick physical exam. Just to listen to your abdomen and check for any tenderness. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, now you want to poke and prod? Honestly. I told you, it’s the pills. But alright, alright. Get it over with. I haven't got all day. Just be gentle, alright? And don't expect me to enjoy it. My husband will be wondering where I am. He’s not good at waiting. And I need to get back to my tomatoes. They’re ripening fast. Hurry up, then. The quicker we’re done, the quicker I can get back to something useful.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Hatchard. I will be as quick and gentle as possible. This won't take long. Okay, just relaxing and taking some deep breaths for me. Sounds normal so far. Now, I’m just going to gently palpate your abdomen. Let me know if you feel any tenderness anywhere. Any discomfort here?
PATIENT: No! Stop poking! It tickles. And it’s cold! Honestly, doctor, you’re going to give me a chill. No discomfort. Perfectly fine. Always have been. I’m a tough woman. I’ve built engines with my own two hands. A little poking isn’t going to bother me. But really, you’re wasting your time. And mine. Are you sure you can’t just prescribe me something for the heartburn and tell me to lay off the pills? That seems a lot more sensible. I'm telling you, it's the pills. This whole thing is ridiculous.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Hatchard. I understand your frustration. However, even though you’re feeling perfectly fine otherwise, we still need to investigate the cause of the black stool. It’s important to rule out anything serious. While the pain medication is a possibility, it's not the only one. To do that, I’d like to order a few simple tests. A complete blood count to check for anemia, and a fecal occult blood test to see if there's any hidden blood in your stool. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Tests? Oh, for heaven's sake. Fine. Whatever. Just get it over with. But don't expect me to come back for a follow-up if it's just something stupid. I've got a garden to run, you know. And a husband who gets grumpy when I'm gone too long. Just tell me where to… deposit the sample. And make it quick. Honestly, the whole medical system is a waste of time. But my husband… well, he worries. So, alright, tests. Just hurry up. Are you going to give me a little container or do I need to find something myself? This is all very inconvenient.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Hatchard. I understand your inconvenience, and I’ll make this as straightforward as possible. The lab is just down the hall; they’ll give you a container and instructions. It’s a small sample, just a little bit from your next bowel movement. Here’s the requisition form. Please take this to the lab, and they’ll walk you through everything. It usually takes a few days to get the results. I’ll have the nurse schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them with you, but if anything concerning comes up, we’ll contact you immediately. In the meantime, if you experience any severe abdominal pain, weakness, dizziness, or feel faint, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: Emergency room? Good heavens. No. I have no questions. Just tell me… do I need to fast or anything? Because I had a biscuit with my tea this morning. A really good biscuit. And if you’re telling me I have to change my diet, I’m walking right out of here. My husband makes the best biscuits. I'm not giving those up for a little black stool. Honestly. Alright, fine. Lab. Biscuits. Emergency room. This is all very stressful. Just... tell me where the lab is. And don't expect me to smile. This has been a thoroughly unpleasant experience. .
DOCTOR: It’s just down the hall, first door on the left. No fasting is required, Ms. Hatchard. You can eat as usual. And please, don't hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or concerns. We are here to help. .
