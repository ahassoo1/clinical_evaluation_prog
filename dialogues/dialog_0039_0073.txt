DOCTOR: Hi Triana, welcome. It’s good to meet you. I’m Dr. Kamahele. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Honestly? I’ve been to enough doctors about this, and I’m starting to lose patience. It’s…well, it’s the runs. Really bad runs. And nothing seems to stop them. I’ve tried… things. A lot of things.
DOCTOR: Okay, “the runs,” as you say. And it's understandably frustrating when things aren’t getting better despite trying different approaches. It sounds like this has been going on for a while. Can you tell me a little more about when this started?
PATIENT: Ugh, "a while" is an understatement. It started… probably around Thanksgiving, last year? Maybe a little before. It comes and goes, but lately it’s been constant. And it's not just inconvenient, it’s… exhausting. Look, I don’t need a lecture on hydration, okay? I'm perfectly capable of taking care of myself. I just want it to stop.
DOCTOR: No, no lectures here at all, Triana. I completely understand. Exhaustion is a very real symptom, and it sounds incredibly draining. And you're right to be frustrated. Okay, so it started around Thanksgiving, and it’s been pretty consistent since then, with a recent worsening. Can you describe what the runs are like?
PATIENT: Like… water. Mostly water. Sometimes… other things, but it’s mostly just… liquid. And it’s frequent. I mean, constantly running to the bathroom. I don’t even bother leaving the house much anymore because I'm afraid of… well, you get the picture. It’s humiliating, frankly. And I've tried everything over-the-counter. Everything.
DOCTOR: Okay, mostly water, very frequent… and you’ve tried over-the-counter remedies. That’s good to know. Humiliating is a strong word, but I understand why you feel that way. To help me get a better picture, could you tell me if anything seems to trigger these episodes?
PATIENT: Trigger? Honestly, no. That's the frustrating part. I thought maybe certain foods at first, but I’ve cut out everything. Dairy, gluten, spicy stuff… you name it. Doesn't matter. Sometimes it happens after I eat, sometimes it doesn’t. Sometimes it just… starts. I'm a painter, you know? I spend a lot of time on my feet, but even when I’m just sitting around, it can happen. It's random. Completely random. I swear, sometimes I think it's just… my body being spiteful.
DOCTOR: Random episodes, even with dietary changes… that is frustrating. And “spiteful” is a good way to put it. It sounds like we need to dig a bit deeper to find out what’s going on. Do you have any other symptoms along with the diarrhea?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Hmm… well, I’ve been tired, obviously. But that could just be from… everything. I’ve had some cramping, lower abdominal pain. Nothing excruciating, just… uncomfortable. And I guess… I’ve lost a little weight, but I haven’t been really trying to diet or anything. Just… not much appetite when I feel like this, you know? I really don't enjoy eating when I'm constantly worried about needing the bathroom five minutes later.
DOCTOR: Okay, tiredness, lower abdominal cramping, and some unintentional weight loss. That's helpful. And it makes perfect sense that your appetite would be affected. Do you have any fever, nausea, or vomiting?
PATIENT: No fever. No vomiting. Occasionally a little nauseous, but it never actually… comes out. It's just a feeling, really. Not severe. It comes and goes. Like everything else, honestly. I'm starting to feel like I’m just describing a mess of random symptoms. Is this even helpful?
DOCTOR: It is helpful, Triana. Truly. A mess of random symptoms is still information. And it helps me rule things in and out. No fever or vomiting is good. Let me ask about your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any chronic medical conditions?
PATIENT: Ugh, past medical history… honestly, not much. I had pneumonia when I was a kid, but that was ages ago. My husband… well, he had some problems, but that's not relevant. I'm otherwise… relatively healthy, I suppose. I don't go to the doctor unless I absolutely have to, and even then, they just tell me to drink more water. I've never been diagnosed with anything long-term. Just… the usual colds and flu. And this, apparently. Which no one can seem to figure out.
DOCTOR: Okay, no chronic medical conditions. Pneumonia as a child… that’s good to know. And I apologize that you haven’t gotten the answers you deserve so far. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No. Never. I avoid hospitals like the plague. Honestly, the thought of being under a knife… no thank you. I’m perfectly fine on my own, thank you very much. I just need someone to fix this problem so I can get back to my life. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: No, that's not too much to ask at all. And I understand your aversion to hospitals – completely reasonable. No surgeries… good to know. Now, what about your family?
PATIENT: Family? Well… my mother passed away a few years ago. She had… arthritis, I think. And my father… he wasn’t really in the picture. My husband’s side… they mostly just had the usual things. High blood pressure, cholesterol. Nothing like this. No one in my family has ever had anything like this. That’s why I'm so frustrated. It’s like I’m the only one. Honestly, sometimes I wonder if I’m just imagining it. Though I doubt that, given how much time I’ve spent in the bathroom.
DOCTOR: Okay, arthritis on your mother’s side, and typical things like high blood pressure on your husband's side. No one with similar issues in your family… that’s helpful to know, although it doesn't rule anything out. Now, let’s talk about your lifestyle a bit. Do you smoke or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Smoke? Absolutely not. Never have. And I used to have a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, but honestly, I haven’t even thought about it in months. I just… haven’t been up to it. It feels… pointless. What difference would a glass of wine make when I’m already feeling like this? It’s not like I’m having a good time, you know? I mostly just try to get through the day. And avoid public restrooms as much as possible.
DOCTOR: Okay, no smoking and minimal alcohol. That's good. And I understand the feeling – no point in doing things if you’re not enjoying them. Finally, do you have any allergies to any medications or foods?
PATIENT: Not that I know of. I've never had a bad reaction to anything. I mean, I've taken over-the-counter things for colds, things like that, and never had a problem. I've tried a few things for this that Dr. [previous doctor's name] recommended, but they didn't do anything, so I don’t even remember what they were. Honestly, at this point, I'm just… resigned. It's probably just something I’m going to have to live with. Though I really, really wish I didn't. Are we almost done here? I've got things to do. Or I would if I wasn't constantly running to the bathroom.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. And I completely understand your frustration – and your wish to get back to your life. We're almost done. Just a quick physical exam, okay?
PATIENT: Fine. Just… please be quick. And try not to ask me too many questions. I've already answered a million of them. I’d really appreciate it. This is… uncomfortable, to say the least.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I’ll be as quick and thorough as possible. First, I’m going to listen to your abdomen with the stethoscope. Just let me know if anything feels painful. Then I’ll just gently palpate your abdomen – feel it to check for tenderness or any abnormalities. Okay?
PATIENT: Fine. Just… get it over with. And try not to poke too hard, okay? It's already sensitive enough as it is.
DOCTOR: Okay. I’m listening to your bowel sounds now… They're a little hyperactive, which isn’t surprising given what you’ve described. Now, I'm going to gently press on your abdomen. Let me know if you feel any pain or tenderness. Do you feel any discomfort here?
PATIENT: A little. There. On the left side. It's not… excruciating, but it's definitely sensitive. It’s kind of a dull ache, more than anything. It’s always been a little tender there, to be honest. But it’s worse now, obviously.
DOCTOR: Okay, some tenderness in the lower left quadrant, a dull ache. It's good you pointed that out. I don't feel any masses or anything concerning at the moment. Everything feels… normal otherwise. Okay, that’s all for the physical exam. Now, given your symptoms and the exam findings… it sounds like you might have Irritable Bowel Syndrome, or IBS. It's a diagnosis of exclusion, though, which means we need to rule out other potential causes first. What do you think about that?
PATIENT: IBS? You mean… there’s no actual reason I feel like this? That’s… incredibly frustrating. Honestly, that’s even worse than not knowing. So I’m just supposed to… live with it? And there's nothing you can do? I thought doctors were supposed to fix things, not give you a label and send you on your way. Is that what this is? Because frankly, that’s a waste of my time. And my money.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Triana, and you’re right to question it. It is frustrating when there isn’t a single clear cause, and it’s absolutely not my intention to just give you a label and send you on your way. IBS is a diagnosis of exclusion, as you said, meaning we need to rule out other possibilities before we can confidently say that’s what’s going on. We need to test for things like infections, inflammatory bowel disease, and celiac disease. But, even if it is IBS, there are things we can do to manage the symptoms and improve your quality of life. Things like dietary changes, stress management techniques, and medications to help control the diarrhea. It's not a cure, unfortunately, but it can make a significant difference. Would you be open to getting some tests done to rule out other conditions?
PATIENT: Fine. I guess I don't have much of a choice, do I? If you think it’s worth it. Though I’m not getting my hopes up. I’ve been to enough doctors about this. Honestly, I doubt anything will show up. But… fine. What tests do I need? And how long is this going to take? I really don’t have time for endless appointments and procedures.
DOCTOR: Okay, I completely understand your skepticism. I won't promise any miracles, but it’s always best to rule things out. We’ll start with a stool test to check for infections and parasites. We’ll also do a blood test to check for inflammation and celiac disease. And I'd like to order a colonoscopy to get a better look at your colon and rule out any structural abnormalities. The stool and blood tests are quick and easy, and we should have the results back in a few days. The colonoscopy will take a bit longer to schedule, and requires some preparation beforehand. It’s the most thorough test, though, and will give us the most information. Does that sound reasonable to you?
PATIENT: A colonoscopy? Seriously? That sounds… unpleasant. I really don’t like the sound of that. Is it absolutely necessary? I mean, couldn't we just try some medication first? Or at least wait and see if the stool and blood tests show anything? I really don’t want to go through all that if it’s not absolutely required. Honestly, I’m starting to regret coming here.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Triana, and it's completely valid. A colonoscopy isn’t the most pleasant procedure, I won't lie. But, given the persistence of your symptoms and the lack of a clear diagnosis, it's the most responsible next step. It allows us to rule out inflammatory bowel disease, which can have serious consequences if left untreated, and check for any other structural problems that could be causing your diarrhea. While medication can help manage the symptoms, it won’t address the underlying cause. If it is inflammatory bowel disease, treating the inflammation with medication is crucial, but we need a colonoscopy to confirm the diagnosis first. I wouldn't recommend it if it wasn't necessary. I can explain the procedure in more detail, if you'd like, and answer any questions you have. We’ll do everything we can to make you comfortable. Would you like me to do that now?
PATIENT: Fine. Explain it. But I’m still not happy about it. And if it turns out to be nothing, you’re going to hear about it. Honestly, this whole thing is just… a waste of time. And frankly, money.
DOCTOR: Okay. A colonoscopy involves inserting a long, flexible tube with a camera on the end into your rectum and guiding it through your colon. It allows us to visualize the lining of your colon and look for any abnormalities, like inflammation, polyps, or tumors. Before the procedure, you’ll need to completely empty your colon, which involves following a special diet and taking a strong laxative. It’s not pleasant, I won’t lie, but it’s essential for a clear view. During the procedure, you’ll be sedated, so you won’t feel any pain or discomfort. It usually takes about 30-60 minutes. Afterward, you may experience some cramping and bloating, but it usually resolves quickly. If we find any abnormalities, we can take a biopsy to examine under a microscope. We'll discuss the results with you in detail and develop a treatment plan if necessary. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: So… they basically clean you out and stick a camera up your… well, you know. And then poke around. And potentially take bits and pieces out. That sounds… invasive. And uncomfortable. And humiliating. Honestly, I'm not sure I can do this. Is there anything else we can try? Even if it's just to temporarily relieve the symptoms? I'm starting to feel… anxious just thinking about it.
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety, Triana, and it's perfectly normal to feel apprehensive about a procedure like this. It is invasive, I won’t minimize that. And it’s okay to feel anxious and even scared. Before we discuss the colonoscopy further, let’s talk about some options to temporarily relieve your symptoms. We can try a low-dose antidiarrheal medication like loperamide, which can help slow down bowel movements. We can also discuss a fiber supplement to help bulk up your stool and improve its consistency. We can also consider a low-FODMAP diet, which involves limiting certain carbohydrates that can trigger digestive symptoms. It’s a complex diet, but it can be effective for some people. However, these are just temporary measures. They won’t address the underlying cause of your diarrhea, and they may not be effective in the long run. The colonoscopy is the most accurate way to get a diagnosis and develop a long-term treatment plan. But, if you’re not comfortable with it right now, we can postpone it. We can try the temporary measures and see if they provide any relief. We can also refer you to a gastroenterologist for a second opinion. Does that sound like a reasonable compromise?
PATIENT: A second opinion… yes. That sounds… good. I want to talk to someone else before I agree to anything. And maybe they'll have a better idea. Or at least be more… understanding. Honestly, this whole thing is just overwhelming. And frankly, I'm exhausted. Just… write me a referral. And tell me what temporary measures I can try in the meantime. Something to help me… function.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I'm happy to write you a referral to Dr. Anya Sharma, a highly respected gastroenterologist in the area. She’s very thorough and has a reputation for being patient and understanding. I’ll send the referral to your insurance company and give you her contact information. In the meantime, you can try over-the-counter loperamide, following the dosage instructions on the label. A fiber supplement like psyllium husk can also be helpful, but start slowly to avoid bloating and gas. And I recommend a low-FODMAP diet – I have a handout here with more information and a list of foods to avoid. I'll also prescribe you a mild antispasmodic medication to help with the cramping. Here's the referral and the handouts. Do you have any questions about any of these options?
PATIENT: No. I think… I think that's all. Just… thank you. I guess. Honestly, I'm still not optimistic, but… I appreciate you listening. And not pushing me too hard. I'll schedule an appointment with Dr. Sharma as soon as possible. Hopefully, she can shed some light on this… mess.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Triana. I completely understand your apprehension, and I'm glad I could provide some reassurance. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. And I hope Dr. Sharma can provide you with some answers. Take care, and please try to get some rest. It’s okay to prioritize your well-being. I’ll have the nurse give you a discharge summary with all of the information we discussed today. Have a good day, Triana. And please take care.
PATIENT: .
