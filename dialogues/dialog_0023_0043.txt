DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Gibbel. I’m Dr. Versace. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Please, call me Percell. Well, it’s this headache I’ve been gettin’. Right in the back of my head, feels like a constant pressure, nothin’ sharp. It’s been botherin’ me for… oh, let me think… about a week now, I’d say. Not gettin’ any better.
DOCTOR: A week, alright. And you said it's a constant pressure in the back of your head. Has anything specific caused it, Percell?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s the thing, Doctor. I can’t really pinpoint anything. I haven’t bumped my head, haven’t been doin’ anything too strenuous, not more than usual anyway. I’ve been workin’ with my clients, same as always – lookin’ at finances, makin’ plans. Maybe a little more stressed lately with the market bein’ a bit shaky, but I wouldn’t say that much more. It just… started.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, no trauma, no changes in activity level. You mention stress – has this headache been worse at any particular time of day, or with specific activities, even thinking about work?
PATIENT: It’s pretty consistent, honestly. Doesn’t really get worse at a certain time, just… always there. Though, I suppose when I’m really focusin’ hard on a client’s portfolio, tryin’ to explain things, it feels a little bit tighter. Not awful, just… noticeable. It's like when I'm concentratin’ real hard, it reminds me it’s there. Does that make sense? I sometimes ramble.
DOCTOR: It does, Percell. It does. And you're not rambling. Now, besides the headache, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Let me think… no fever, no dizziness. My vision’s been fine, I can read just as well as always – I still read the paper every mornin’. No trouble with my balance. I haven’t been feelin’ nauseous or anything like that. Oh! My appetite’s been a little off, maybe eatin’ a bit less than usual, but I figured that was just ‘cause I’m not feelin’ 100%. Is that important, Doctor?
DOCTOR: A slight decrease in appetite… noted. Now, let’s go over your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any conditions – high blood pressure, diabetes, anything like that?
PATIENT: No, nothin’ like that. I’ve always been pretty healthy, knock on wood. I’ve had the usual colds and flu over the years, but never anything serious. I had my gallbladder out… oh, must be twenty years ago now. Other than that, I’m pretty clear. I’ve always tried to stay active, walk every day, eat a decent diet. Not much of a drinker or smoker, either. Never really got into that. Does that help? Should I be tellin’ you about my childhood illnesses? I can try to remember.
DOCTOR: No, childhood illnesses aren’t necessary at this point, Percell. Twenty years ago for the gallbladder removal… alright. And no current medications?
PATIENT: Nope, no medications at all. Not a single one. I pride myself on bein’ able to avoid those, if I can. Always figured a good walk and a bit of fresh air were better than any pill they could give ya. But... now that you mention it, I did try somethin’ over-the-counter last week. Just some ibuprofen, for the headache, but it didn’t really do much. That was, maybe three or four days ago. Didn't take it long, just a couple doses.
DOCTOR: Ibuprofen… and it provided minimal relief. Right. Now, any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope, no allergies that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. I can eat anything, take any medicine… well, except for that ibuprofen, apparently. I’ve never had any trouble with that sort of thing. My wife – my ex-wife, that is – she was the one with the allergies. Pollen, dust mites, cats… all sorts of things. I always had to be careful around her! But me? Clear as a bell.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, let's move on to your family history. Any significant illnesses in your family – heart disease, stroke, cancer, dementia… anything like that?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. My mother, she lived to be 88, and she was pretty healthy for most of her life. She did have some arthritis in her later years, but that was about it. My father, he passed away when I was young, heart attack, I think. Maybe 60, 65? And my sister… she had cancer, lung cancer, a few years back. Didn’t make it. Beyond that, nothin’ too serious that I can recall. It’s been a long time. My family wasn't big on talkin' about health stuff, to be honest. It wasn't somethin' we really discussed much. Does that help? Should I be thinkin' about cousins or somethin'?
DOCTOR: No, that’s sufficient for now, Percell. Let’s just do a quick assessment here. Follow my finger… good. Now look left… and right… alright. Squeeze my hands… Your reflexes seem… normal. Any tenderness here?
PATIENT: Ooh, that’s a little tender, yes. Right about there. Not awful, but I can feel it when you press. It’s kinda achy, like a dull throb. It's been that way for a while, actually, now that you’re touchin’ it. Feels like the muscle’s a little tight there too. It’s not the sharp pain from when you have a cold, more like a constant pressure. Like somethin’s been strained or somethin’. Does that make sense? It's hard to explain.
DOCTOR: Yes, Percell, I understand. Tenderness at the base of the skull, muscle tightness… It sounds like you’re likely experiencing a tension headache, possibly with some muscle strain in the neck. Given your age, medical history, and the lack of other concerning symptoms, that's the most probable explanation. However, given your sister's history and to be thorough, I would like to order a basic blood work panel – just to rule out any underlying inflammatory conditions. And… I'm going to recommend a short course of a muscle relaxant and over-the-counter pain relief. Do you have any questions for me?
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds… reasonable. A tension headache, huh? I guess that makes sense, I have been a little stressed lately. Blood work, okay, no problem. Muscle relaxant… I’m not a big fan of takin’ pills, but if it helps, I guess I can try it. I suppose my only question is… is it somethin’ serious? Like, should I be worried? With my sister… well, you understand. I don't want somethin' creepin' up on me. And what about the walkin’? Should I still keep doin’ that? That’s kinda important to me.
DOCTOR: Percell, your sister’s condition was lung cancer; this is a headache. The likelihood of a connection is… negligible. The blood work is simply a precaution to rule out anything unlikely given your presentation. The muscle relaxant is a low dose and should help alleviate the tension in your neck. And yes, absolutely continue your walking – in fact, I encourage it. It’s excellent for overall health and can actually help with tension headaches. I’m ordering the blood work now. I'll have the lab results sent to you within three to five business days. If the headache worsens significantly, or you develop any new symptoms – fever, vision changes, weakness – contact the office immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, I understand. Blood work, keep walkin’, and contact you if it gets worse. You're right, probably just the stress. I get caught in my head sometimes, worryin' too much. Thank you for takin' the time to listen, and for not makin’ me feel like I'm overreactin'. I appreciate that. When should I schedule the blood work? .
DOCTOR: You can go to any Quest Diagnostics location. The form has a list of the nearest ones. Schedule it at your convenience, within the next week. The walking is excellent, and try to incorporate some simple stretching exercises for your neck and shoulders. And… try to manage your stress levels, Percell. I understand that’s easier said than done, but it's crucial. That will be all for today. If you have any questions after reviewing the instructions, don’t hesitate to call the office. Have a good day. .
