DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Courtnye. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Finco. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Hi, Dr. Finco. It's nice to meet you too. Um, well, it’s my bruising. It’s just…been getting worse, and I’m on blood thinners, so I figured I should get it checked out. It’s kinda worrying me, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, bruising that's getting worse, especially while on blood thinners. That is worth checking out, you’re right to come in. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Sure. It started, I guess, a couple of weeks ago? Small bruises, you know, from bumping into things. Normal stuff. But now…I barely touch myself and one pops up. And they’re bigger, and darker. I don’t even remember how I got some of them. Like, yesterday I found one on my thigh and I have no idea where that came from. It’s just…weird. And kinda scary, if I’m being honest.
DOCTOR: That does sound concerning, Courtnye. Bruising easily and without a clear cause is definitely something we need to investigate, especially with you being on blood thinners. Let’s try to get a clearer picture. When you say a couple of weeks ago, can you recall anything specific that might have triggered the first bruise?
PATIENT: Hmm…let me think. Nothing specific, no. Just the usual little bumps and scrapes. I do a lot of gardening, so maybe that? But I've been gardening for years and never had anything like this. It’s just…suddenly started. It wasn’t gradual or anything, it was just…boom. More bruising, bigger bruising. Honestly, I’m not sure. I really don’t remember doing anything to cause it.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it was relatively sudden onset, with no clear traumatic event to explain it, even with the gardening. And you’ve been gardening for years without this happening before. Good to know. Now, besides the bruising, have you noticed anything else?
PATIENT: Let me think…no, not really. I’ve been a little more tired, maybe? But honestly, who isn’t tired? And, this might sound weird, but my gums bleed a little more when I brush my teeth. Just a little bit, though. Nothing major. But now that I think about it, yeah, a bit more bleeding than usual. That’s about it, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, a little more fatigue, and some increased gum bleeding. Those things can be connected. Now, let's talk a bit about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Um, let me see. I have high blood pressure, which is why I’m on the blood thinners. And, I had my gallbladder removed a few years ago. Oh, and I’ve got a little bit of arthritis in my hands, but nothing serious. That’s about it, I think. Nothing else that I know of. Why? Is that a problem?
DOCTOR: Not necessarily a problem, Courtnye, just important information. The high blood pressure and being on blood thinners are particularly relevant here, of course. And the gallbladder removal is good to know. Now, what about your family?
PATIENT: Okay. Um, my mom had high blood pressure too, and she had some heart problems later in life. And my dad...he had diabetes. But that's about it. No history of bleeding disorders or anything like that that I know of. I don’t really know much about my grandparents’ medical history. They passed away a long time ago, and nobody really talked about it.
DOCTOR: Okay, high blood pressure and diabetes in your family. Good to know. Now, do you currently take any other medications besides the blood thinner?
PATIENT: Just the blood thinner, and a little something for my blood pressure, a water pill. That's it. I try to avoid taking too many pills, if I can. Everything else, I just try to manage with diet and exercise. Mostly diet, honestly. That's why I'm so annoyed about the bruising! I'm trying to be healthy and now this is happening.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Courtnye. It's good you're proactive about your health. Let’s get some more information so we can figure out what's going on. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I've never had a reaction to anything. I can eat anything, take any medicine…nothing bothers me. Honestly, that's why this whole bruising thing is so confusing! I don’t have any obvious reason for it to be happening. It’s really strange.
DOCTOR: Alright. That's very helpful, thank you. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright. I’ll just listen to your heart and lungs, and then take a closer look at the bruising. We'll also need to do some bloodwork to get a better understanding of what's happening. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds fine. Whatever you need to do. Just get it over with, honestly. I got a bunch of errands to run. Hopefully, it's nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Okay, let's start with listening to your heart and lungs. Just breathe normally for me. I'm just listening for any unusual sounds. Okay, your heart and lungs sound clear. And the bruising…it's definitely present, some are quite extensive. I don’t feel any lumps or bumps associated with them, which is good. I am noting the locations and sizes in your chart. Now, could you please roll up your sleeves so I can take your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Okay. Here you go. Just get it over with, please. I've got things to do today. Hopefully this won’t take too long. It's kinda making me nervous, honestly.
DOCTOR: Your blood pressure is a little elevated today, but not significantly. It’s within the range we’d expect with some anxiety. Now, I’m going to need to draw a few vials of blood. I’ll send those off to the lab, and they'll run some tests to check your blood counts, clotting factors, and kidney and liver function. It'll help us determine what's going on with the bruising. It'll take a few days to get the results back. This might sting a little bit… Just try to relax.
PATIENT: Ugh. I hate needles. Just hurry, please. And please tell me if it’s anything serious when you get the results. I really don’t have time for this.
DOCTOR: Alright, all done. You did great. Here's a bandage. Keep it on for about 15-20 minutes. While we wait for the lab results, it's important to avoid any activities that could cause injury. And definitely avoid taking any over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or aspirin, as those can thin the blood even further. Now, I know you're anxious to get this figured out. I completely understand. Based on what you've told me, and the initial exam, there are a few possibilities we need to rule out. It could be related to your medications, but we need the bloodwork to confirm that. It could also be a sign of something else going on. I want to be thorough, so we’ll get those results as quickly as possible. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s it. Just…get the results back fast, please. And call me if it’s anything really bad. I gotta go, honestly. This whole thing is stressing me out. Thanks for… everything. I guess.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. We'll get those results back to you as quickly as we can, Courtnye. We’ll call you right away if anything concerning comes up. Here’s a copy of the lab requisition form for your records, and a little information about things to watch out for in the meantime. Please don't hesitate to call if you experience any new or worsening symptoms. And remember, we’re here to help. Have a good day, Courtnye. Try not to worry too much. We’ll get to the bottom of this. .
