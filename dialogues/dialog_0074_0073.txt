DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Woodring. My name is Dr. Reisig. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. Can you tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Honestly? It’s ridiculous I even have to be here. I’ve been dealing with…well, let’s just say my stomach hasn’t been cooperating for weeks now. And nothing the other doctor gave me is working. It’s just… embarrassing.
DOCTOR: I understand it can be difficult to discuss these things, Ms. Woodring, and I appreciate you being so open with me. It’s not ridiculous at all to seek help when you’re not feeling well, and it's good you're following up. We’ll get to the bottom of this. To start, can you tell me a bit more about what you mean by “not cooperating”?
PATIENT: Ugh, fine. It's… diarrhea. Constant diarrhea. Like, I can't leave the house without worrying. And it's not just a little upset, it’s… watery. A lot. I've tried everything – bland food, those… Imodium things, even some herbal tea my aunt swore by. Nothing stops it. It just keeps… going. And going. It’s been, honestly, a month, maybe longer? I lost track.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for sharing that with me. Constant diarrhea for a month or longer is definitely something we need to investigate. It sounds very disruptive to your life, and I want to assure you we’ll work to find a solution. To help me understand what’s going on, could you describe a typical day with this issue?
PATIENT: A typical day? Honestly, it revolves around where the nearest bathroom is. I wake up, try to have a normal breakfast – usually toast, something simple – and then I'm just… waiting. Waiting for it to happen. I try to get through my work, painting mostly, but I have to cancel jobs if I’m feeling bad. Which is often. I eat very little during the day, because, frankly, it usually just comes right back up or… well, you get the picture. It's exhausting. And embarrassing. Is this really all you need to know? I feel like I'm oversharing.
DOCTOR: You’re not oversharing at all, Ms. Woodring. It’s important to give me a complete picture, and you’re doing a great job explaining what you’re experiencing. It sounds incredibly stressful and disruptive to your daily life. To clarify, when you say “comes right back up,” are you experiencing nausea and vomiting in addition to the diarrhea, or is it more that the diarrhea is so urgent it feels like things are “coming back up”?
PATIENT: It's… sometimes both, actually. Most of the time, it's just the urgency – feeling like I’m going to lose control, you know? Like a wave just hits me. But a few times, especially if I try to eat anything remotely substantial, I actually throw up. It's not constant vomiting, thankfully, but it's happened enough that I'm terrified to eat. And frankly, I'm losing weight. This is so undignified. Are you writing all this down?
DOCTOR: Yes, I am writing all of this down, Ms. Woodring. It’s important information. The nausea and occasional vomiting along with the weight loss are concerning, and I appreciate you telling me. Now, let’s talk a little bit about other symptoms. Have you noticed any blood or mucus in your stool?
PATIENT: Ugh, don't make me talk about that. Yes. Sometimes. Not every time, but… yes, there’s been blood. It's not like a ton, usually just… streaks. And sometimes it’s… slimy. Look, I told you this was embarrassing. I really don’t want to talk about my… waste products with a stranger. Is this going to require tests? Because I really don’t have the energy for a lot of poking and prodding.
DOCTOR: I understand this is difficult, Ms. Woodring, and I apologize if I’m asking personal questions, but these details are important for determining the cause of your symptoms. I assure you, everything we discuss is confidential. The presence of blood and mucus is something we absolutely need to investigate further. Yes, we will likely need to do some tests. We’ll start with a stool sample to check for infection or inflammation, and I’d also like to do a physical exam, listening to your abdomen and checking for any tenderness. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. Just… get it over with. I have things to do, you know. People waiting on paint jobs. This is costing me money. A stool sample, you said? And poking? Honestly. I suppose I don’t have a choice. Just try to be quick about it. And please tell me you have gloves.
DOCTOR: Of course, I have gloves. I always do. And I understand your frustration, Ms. Woodring – I'll be as efficient as possible. First, let's talk about the stool sample. I'll give you a collection kit and instructions. It’s a fairly straightforward process, and you can do it at home. We’ll just need you to bring it back to the clinic as soon as possible. Now, if you don’t mind, I'm going to listen to your abdomen with my stethoscope. Just lie back on the examination table, and let me know if anything feels uncomfortable.
PATIENT: Fine. Just… don't take all day. Let's just get this over with. And be gentle. I bruise easily.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Woodring. Just take some nice, deep breaths. I'm listening for any unusual sounds. I do hear some increased activity in your lower abdomen, which isn't surprising given your symptoms. It’s a bit tender to the touch as well, especially in the left lower quadrant. Do you feel any particular pain or discomfort when I press there?
PATIENT: Yes! That… that stabs a little. Not awful, but… definitely noticeable. Like a cramping sort of pain. It's been like that for a few days, actually. It comes and goes, but it's always there, lurking. Is that… bad? Honestly, everything sounds bad. Are you thinking it's something serious? Don't tell me it's cancer. My mother… never mind. Just tell me what you think.
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety, Ms. Woodring. It’s natural to be concerned, especially with a family history. Let me assure you, we’re not jumping to any conclusions right now. The tenderness you’re describing, along with the cramping pain, does require further investigation. While it could be a number of things – an infection, inflammation, or even a food sensitivity – we need to rule out more serious possibilities. Given your symptoms and the blood in your stool, I want to order a complete blood count to check for signs of infection or anemia, and I’d also like to schedule a colonoscopy. It’s the most thorough way to examine the entire colon and identify any abnormalities. Would you be comfortable with those next steps?
PATIENT: A colonoscopy? Seriously? Oh, great. That sounds… delightful. I’ve heard horror stories. All that… preparation. And poking around in there? No. Absolutely not. Is there anything else we can do? Any tests that don’t involve… that? I really don’t think I can do that. It sounds absolutely dreadful. Look, I’m already losing money, and now you want to put me out of commission for days? This is just fantastic.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Ms. Woodring, and I wouldn't recommend it if I didn’t believe it was important. I know the preparation isn’t pleasant, and the procedure itself can be anxiety-inducing, but it is the gold standard for evaluating the colon and ruling out serious conditions. We can start with some less invasive tests – a stool culture to identify any bacterial infections, and a fecal immunochemical test to look for hidden blood in your stool. However, if those tests are inconclusive, a colonoscopy will be necessary to get a definitive diagnosis. The FIT test is just a simple stool sample you collect at home. It’s less involved than the one I asked for earlier. Would you be willing to start with that?
PATIENT: Fine. The… FIT test. As long as it doesn’t involve… everything else. Just… please hurry. And tell me exactly what I need to do. I don’t want to have to come back here again. This whole thing is just… exhausting. Do I need a prescription for it? And can I get it done quickly? I have jobs to get to.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Woodring, we’ll start with the FIT test. It’s a simple stool sample, as we discussed, and doesn’t require any special preparation. Yes, I will write you a prescription for the FIT test kit. You can pick it up at your pharmacy, and the kit will include detailed instructions on how to collect the sample. It’s important to follow those instructions carefully. Once you’ve collected the sample, you can drop it off at the lab here at the clinic, and the results should be available within a week or so. While we wait for the results, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or herbal supplements?
PATIENT: Ugh, just… whatever my aunt gives me. She’s always trying to get me to take something. Some tea for my stomach, some pills for… I don't know, general wellness? Honestly, I can't keep track. I take some ibuprofen occasionally for my back, but that’s about it. I try to avoid taking anything, because everything seems to make my stomach worse. I really just want this to stop. I’m losing weight, I’m missing work, and I'm tired of being sick. It's really starting to get me down.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Woodring. It's completely understandable that you're feeling frustrated and discouraged. We will get to the bottom of this. It’s good to know about the tea and pills, even if you can’t remember the exact names. It’s possible they could be contributing to your symptoms. I recommend stopping them until we get the results of the FIT test and can determine the cause of your diarrhea. So, to summarize, we’re going to stop any herbal remedies or supplements, get the FIT test done, and I'll follow up with you next week to discuss the results. In the meantime, if you experience any worsening symptoms – fever, severe abdominal pain, or vomiting – please don't hesitate to call the clinic or go to the emergency room. Do you have any questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: No. Just… get me out of here. Thank you. I think. Just… I really need to get back to work. Hopefully, this test will tell us something. .
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Woodring. I completely understand. I'll have the nurse walk you out. Please don't hesitate to call if you have any concerns. And I sincerely hope we can get to the bottom of this quickly and get you feeling better. .
