DOCTOR: Hi Tasmia, welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Kamahele. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: High blood pressure, the nurse said. Honestly, I don’t see what the big deal is. It’s just a number, right? My husband made the appointment. He worries too much.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It’s good that your husband is looking out for you, and it's good you came in to get it checked out. Sometimes those numbers can tell us important things, even if you’re feeling alright. It's definitely worth understanding what's going on. Can you tell me a little more about when you found out your blood pressure was high?
PATIENT: Like I said, the nurse checked it. Yesterday, I think. She was… very insistent. I was at a work site, doing some surveying. It was hot. Maybe that had something to do with it? I don’t usually go to doctors. Waste of time, if you ask me.
DOCTOR: I understand your feeling that way, and it’s true, a hot day can raise your blood pressure a bit. It's good you mentioned that. We'll take everything into account. Just so I have a clear picture, could you tell me a little about your work?
PATIENT: I’m a civil engineering tech. Mostly I’m outside, doing… fieldwork. Lots of walking, checking levels, making sure things are where they’re supposed to be. It’s physical work. Pretty straightforward. Not a desk job, thank goodness. It’s hot a lot of the time, like I said. And dusty. Is that important?
DOCTOR: Yes, that is important. Both the physical activity and being out in the heat and dust can give us some clues. Now, besides the high blood pressure reading yesterday, have you been feeling any symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms? No. I feel fine. Perfectly fine. That's why I'm here, because I am fine. My husband gets worked up about everything. He reads things online, and then suddenly I need to be checked for… everything. Honestly, it's exhausting. No symptoms. I haven’t been sick or anything.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. No headaches, dizziness, shortness of breath, or vision changes?
PATIENT: No. Look, I told you, I feel fine. Headaches? When was the last time I had a headache? Vision changes? I see perfectly well. I’m a surveyor, remember? I need to see well. This is ridiculous. Are we done yet? I have work to get back to.
DOCTOR: Okay, okay, I understand. I'm just trying to get a complete picture. No symptoms, that's good. Let's talk about your medical history, then. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions—anything at all?
PATIENT: No. Nothing. I’ve always been healthy. My family… well, we’re all pretty tough. My grandma lived to be ninety, and she worked on a ranch her whole life. We don’t get sick. I don’t need a long list of things I might be at risk for. Just… no. Healthy. Never been sick. Is that good enough?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s very good to know. No previous hospitalizations or surgeries?
PATIENT: No! Absolutely not. I've never been in a hospital. I’m not that kind of person. I fix things, I don’t go to hospitals to be fixed. Are we seriously doing this? I'm starting to think my husband just wants me to take time off work.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand your frustration. It sounds like you’re very active and healthy. Let's quickly go over family history, then. Do you know if anyone in your family—parents, grandparents, siblings—has had problems with high blood pressure, heart disease, diabetes, or kidney problems?
PATIENT: Honestly? No. Not that I know of. My family doesn’t really… talk about that stuff. We’re more about getting things done than sitting around discussing medical histories. My grandma was strong, like I said. Everyone worked hard. We didn't sit around complaining about aches and pains. So, no. I doubt it. Honestly, I'm not even sure I have extended family. We’re a pretty small group. Can we just… be done now? I really need to get back to work. This is wasting my time.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. And you don’t currently take any medications, or have any allergies that you know of?
PATIENT: No medications. No allergies. I eat pretty normally, I guess. Nothing fancy. And I’m not allergic to anything. Dust, maybe, but that’s just irritating, not an allergy. Look, I'm a simple person. I don't have a lot of complicated medical needs. I just want to make sure I'm healthy enough to do my job. Is that so much to ask? Can we just check my blood pressure again and get this over with?
DOCTOR: Alright. I’m going to do a quick physical exam and then we'll recheck your blood pressure. Just to be thorough. It’ll only take a few minutes. It includes listening to your heart and lungs, and feeling your pulse. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. Just get it over with. But if it’s normal, I’m leaving. I have work to do, and I'm wasting valuable time here. Don’t expect a detailed explanation if everything is fine. I understand the basics. Just tell me if I can go back to work or not.
DOCTOR: Okay. Let's start by listening to your heart and lungs. I’ll need you to take a few deep breaths for me. Heart sounds are normal. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Pulse is regular and strong. Now, I’m just going to quickly check your reflexes. Reflexes are normal. Now, we will recheck your blood pressure. Please remain seated and relaxed. Your blood pressure is 148 over 92. Still elevated.
PATIENT: Elevated? See? This is exactly what I thought. It’s probably just the work site, the heat, the dust… I told you I was fine! My husband is going to be so happy he wasted a perfectly good afternoon. Honestly, what now? Are you going to prescribe me a bunch of pills I don’t need? I just want to go back to work. This is ridiculous. .
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Tasmia. While you feel fine, this blood pressure reading is consistently elevated. It doesn’t necessarily mean you need medication right away, but it does mean we need to investigate further to understand why your blood pressure is high. Given this reading, and the fact that you haven’t been diagnosed with any other health conditions, I recommend a few things. First, I’d like you to get some blood work to check your kidney function, electrolytes, and a basic metabolic panel. Second, it would be helpful to monitor your blood pressure at home for a week, a couple times a day, and keep a log. Then, let's schedule a follow-up appointment in two weeks to discuss the results and decide on the best course of action. Does that sound alright?
