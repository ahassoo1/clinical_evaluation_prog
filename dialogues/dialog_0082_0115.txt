DOCTOR: Good morning, Annelle. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. IUZZOLINO, but you can call me Wendall. It's nice to meet you. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh… good morning, Doctor. It is nice to meet you as well. Um… well, it’s about my… a friend. Yes, a friend. She’s been… quite yellow lately. And the doctor she usually sees… I can’t quite recall his name… sent her here. Something about her liver, I believe. It’s all a bit muddled, if I’m honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, a friend… experiencing some yellowing. That yellowing – is that in her skin, or maybe her eyes?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, both, I think. Definitely her skin… a sort of… sickly yellow. And her eyes… yes, the whites of her eyes aren’t quite white anymore. They’ve got that same… tinge. It’s rather worrying, you see. She's not been well for some time, and this… this yellowing has just made things worse. I do apologize for being so vague; my memory isn't what it once was.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all, Annelle. These things happen. It's perfectly alright. Yellowing of the skin and eyes… that’s called jaundice, and it can certainly be a sign of something we need to investigate. Has she been feeling any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Jaundice… yes, that’s right. That's what the other doctor mentioned. Oh, dear… symptoms. Let me think… She's been very tired, I know that. Just… utterly exhausted. And… she’s lost her appetite. Doesn't seem to want to eat anything. And… oh, yes! She’s been complaining of an ache, a dull ache, right under her ribs. On her… on her right side, I believe. Is that… helpful? I’m truly trying to recall everything, but it’s all rather… hazy.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s very helpful, thank you. Tiredness, loss of appetite, and pain under the right ribs… those are all important pieces of the puzzle. Now, has she noticed any changes in her urine or stool?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness… urine and stool. Now that’s a question… I don’t believe she’s mentioned anything about her urine. No, not that I recall. As for… stool… well, she’s a private woman, you see. She doesn’t discuss such things with me. I’m afraid I can’t offer any information on that front. I do apologize. Is it… is it absolutely necessary to know?
DOCTOR: It's alright, Annelle. No need to apologize. We can proceed without that information for now. Let’s talk a little about her medical history, if you don’t mind. Has she been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, medical history… Yes, I think so. She… she had something with her liver a long time ago. Hepatitis, I believe it was. Years and years ago. She was quite ill then, but she recovered. Or, at least, we thought she did. She's seen doctors… regularly, over the years. But I can’t recall who, exactly. And… she's taken a lot of different medications, I know that for a fact. Different pills for… different things. It's all a bit of a blur, I'm afraid.
DOCTOR: Okay, a history of hepatitis… that’s very important to know. And multiple medications… do you happen to know what some of those medications were for?
PATIENT: Oh dear… that’s a difficult one. There was… something for her blood pressure, I think. She had high blood pressure for a while. And… something for her nerves, I believe. She was very anxious, you see. And… oh, yes! A pill for her stomach. She had a lot of trouble with her stomach. But beyond that… I’m truly drawing a blank, Doctor. She keeps a very organized pill box, but I don't know what each one is for. She manages her own medication, mostly.
DOCTOR: Alright, blood pressure medication, something for nerves, and something for her stomach… We'll need to get a list of her current medications, if possible. Now, does she have any allergies to medications, or anything else for that matter?
PATIENT: Oh, allergies… let me think… She used to be allergic to penicillin, I believe. Years ago. But I don’t know if she still is. She hasn't taken it in a very long time. And… she’s a bit sensitive to… bright lights, sometimes. It gives her a headache. But beyond that… I don’t believe she has any serious allergies. She’s a fairly robust woman, all things considered.
DOCTOR: Okay, a history of penicillin allergy, and sensitivity to bright lights. Now, what about her family?
PATIENT: Oh… family. That’s… another difficult one. She doesn’t speak about her family much. She had… a difficult childhood, I think. She had several siblings, I believe, but I don’t know what happened to them. I don’t recall her mentioning any family illnesses, if that’s what you mean. She’s very… independent, you see. She’s always kept to herself. I apologize for being so unhelpful, Doctor. I wish I could provide more information.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all, Annelle. You're doing the best you can. Now, let’s talk a little bit about her lifestyle. Does she smoke, or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Oh, lifestyle… Well, she used to smoke, years ago. A very long time ago. But she quit. She’s very proud of that, actually. And… she doesn't drink alcohol. Never has. She’s always been very… temperate, you see. She's a very careful woman. She watches what she eats, mostly. She tries to stay healthy, even though… well, even though things haven’t been easy.
DOCTOR: Alright, that's good to know. Now, I’d like to examine your friend, if that’s alright. Just a routine physical exam to get a better sense of what’s going on. Is she here with you today?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, she’s here. She’s… a bit nervous, to be honest. She’s in the waiting room. She was hesitant to come, but I convinced her. I’m not sure she likes doctors very much. She’s… very private, you see. Are you sure you need to examine her? Couldn’t we just… talk about it some more? I’m truly trying to be helpful, Doctor, but I worry she’ll be uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: I understand her hesitation, Annelle. It’s perfectly alright to feel that way. But a physical exam is really important in this case. It helps me to get a clearer picture of what's going on and to decide what tests might be needed. I promise to be as gentle and respectful as possible. I'll explain everything I'm doing as I go, and we can take breaks whenever she needs them. Would you like to be present during the exam for support?
PATIENT: Oh… well, if you insist. And if she really needs it… Yes, I suppose I should be there. I’m not sure I’ll be much help, but… yes. She’ll feel better knowing I’m there. But please… be gentle. She’s a delicate woman, despite everything. And… try not to ask her too many personal questions, if you don’t mind. She gets… flustered easily.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Annelle. I understand. I'll be as gentle and respectful as possible. And I'll only ask what’s necessary to get a good understanding of her condition. Let’s go ahead and bring her in, then. We'll start with some basic observations – checking her blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. Then I’ll listen to her heart and lungs, and gently examine her abdomen. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… reasonable. As long as you're gentle. I'll go get her now. She's probably very anxious. It’s… been a long day for her, already. Please, be patient with her. She doesn't always… express herself easily.
DOCTOR: Take your time, Annelle. I’ll be right here.
