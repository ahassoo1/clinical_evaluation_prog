DOCTOR: Right. Mr. Brege, is it?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s me. Clide Brege. Look, Doc, I got things to do today, so if we could just get this over with, that’d be great. This fever’s been buggin’ me again.
DOCTOR: “Buggin’ you,” right. Well, we all have things to do, Mr. Brege, but rushing through things rarely gets us anywhere useful. Now, tell me about this fever. How long has it been going on this time?
PATIENT: Ugh, lemme think… it started, oh, about three days ago, I guess. Comes and goes, nothin’ constant. Last time it was like this was… April, maybe? It always seems to hit when it gets really humid, if that means anything. I just want to know what’s causing it, ya know? It ain’t comfortable.
DOCTOR: April, you say?
PATIENT: Yep. Around then. I remember 'cause my wife, Elena, she kept telling me to drink more water. She always says that when I’m feelin’ under the weather. Doesn’t always help, but she means well. Anyway, this time it’s… I dunno, feels a little worse, maybe? Just achy all over.
DOCTOR: “Achy all over.” Right. And besides the fever and aches, anything else?
PATIENT: Nah, not really. No cough, no sniffles, no… you know, the usual. Just tired. Really tired. And warm. It's just… draining. I haven't been sleeping great either, tossin' and turnin'. But that could be anything, I suppose.
DOCTOR: “Tossing and turning.” Okay. And have you noticed any… changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Whoa, hold on a second. Now you’re askin’ personal questions! What’s that got to do with a fever? I just want to know why I feel like garbage, not… that. Look, Doc, I’m a simple man. I fix backs, I don’t talk about… stuff.
DOCTOR: Mr. Brege, I assure you, it’s all relevant. We need to get a complete picture. It’s a standard part of the evaluation. But fine. We’ll skip that for now. Have you traveled anywhere recently?
PATIENT: Nah, nothin’ fancy. Just down to see my sister in Miami back in June. That was a quick trip, just a weekend. Aside from that, I’ve been here, workin’. I haven’t been off this island in months. It's too expensive to travel, ya know? Besides, my patients need me. Gotta keep those spines aligned.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you taking any medications currently?
PATIENT: Just a little somethin’ for my arthritis, now and then. Ibuprofen, when it flares up. Nothing regular, though. I try to avoid pills as much as possible. Elena’s always tellin’ me I should try more natural remedies, but… I’m a practical man, Doc. Pills work faster. And I ain’t a fan of teas and stuff.
DOCTOR: And do you have any allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: Nope. Never had a problem with any pills, honestly. I’ve taken all sorts over the years for different things, and never had a reaction. Elena always asks, but I always tell her the same thing. No allergies. I’m pretty tough, I think. Gotta be, fixin’ backs all day. It’s hard work.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s have a quick look. Just going to listen to your heart and lungs, and feel your abdomen. Nothing major. Please lie down on the table.
PATIENT: Fine, fine. Let’s get this over with. Just… hurry it up, Doc. I got appointments waitin’.
DOCTOR: Alright. Your temperature is slightly elevated. Heart rate’s a little quick, but nothing alarming. Abdomen's a bit tender… Now, this tenderness could be a number of things. It's not enough to say for sure. Given your history, and the recurring nature of these fevers, I’m going to order some blood work. Just to rule things out. Complete blood count, metabolic panel, and a CRP to check for inflammation.
PATIENT: Blood work, huh? Look, Doc, I don’t like needles. And I ain’t insured, so how much is this gonna cost me? Elena’s gonna kill me if I rack up a big bill. Can’t we just… give me somethin’ for the fever and be done with it? Like, an antibiotic or somethin’? I’ve taken those before, they usually work.
DOCTOR: Mr. Brege, I understand your concerns, but simply throwing antibiotics at a fever without knowing the cause is irresponsible, and frankly, bad medicine. It can lead to antibiotic resistance and won’t necessarily solve the problem. As for the cost, I’ll see what the lab offers in terms of a cash price. But getting a diagnosis is the priority. We need to know why you’re having these fevers. The blood work will help us with that. We're not just trying to treat symptoms, we're trying to find the root cause. And, frankly, your insistence on a quick fix is… concerning. I’m ordering the tests. We’ll discuss the results when they come back.
PATIENT: Alright, alright! Fine. Do your tests. But if it's gonna cost me an arm and a leg, I'm walkin' out. And don't give me any fancy medical talk, just tell me what it means in plain English. And try to be quick about it, Doc. I really do have patients waitin'. Let's get this over with. .
DOCTOR: Alright. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood. She'll explain the process. And I will explain the results in plain English, Mr. Brege. But I expect you to be patient and listen. That’s all for now. I’ll see you when the results are back.
