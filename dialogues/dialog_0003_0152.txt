DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Geho. I'm Dr. Yackey. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, the nurse told me it was about my cholesterol. She said it was a little high when they did the blood work. I don’t really understand what that means, exactly. Is it bad?
DOCTOR: Yes, well, it can be. Cholesterol is… a fatty substance in your blood. High levels, over time, can lead to… complications. Though, frankly, a single reading isn't always indicative. Let's not get ahead of ourselves. Do you have any family history of heart disease or high cholesterol?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. My father… he had some heart trouble later in life, I think. He needed a… a bypass, maybe? It was a long time ago, and I wasn’t really involved in his medical things. My mother was always the one who handled all that. And my brother… he's pretty healthy, as far as I know. He doesn't talk much about doctor's visits. Does that help? I’m sorry I’m not very specific.
DOCTOR: It’s… adequate. Bypass surgery indicates a significant history, certainly. And your brother's lack of information isn’t particularly useful. Alright. Have you ever been diagnosed with high cholesterol before?
PATIENT: No, never. This is the first time anyone has mentioned it to me. I usually feel pretty good, actually. I walk a lot – I live on a big property, so I’m always outside doing something. I eat… well, I eat normal things, I guess. Not a lot of fast food, but I do like my cheese.
DOCTOR: "Patient reports normal diet, enjoys cheese." Alright. And are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Just what the doctor gave me for a bad cold last winter. And sometimes, if my arthritis is acting up, I’ll take some over-the-counter pain relief. Nothing regularly, though. Just when I need it. I have Medicare, so I try to keep things simple, you know?
DOCTOR: Sensible. Any allergies to medications, or anything else, for that matter?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. They always ask when they give me shots, and I’ve never had a reaction. I get the flu shot every year, and the pneumonia one too, because the nurse said I should. I can't think of anything I’m allergic to, really. I love flowers, and I garden, so… if I was allergic to something, I think I'd know!
DOCTOR: Very well. Let’s proceed with a brief physical exam, then. It's standard procedure. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your general condition. Please lie back on the examination table.
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds good. Just let me know if I need to do anything special. I'm not very good at remembering instructions, sometimes.
DOCTOR: Heart sounds are… regular, though a bit distant. No murmurs detected at this time. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Blood pressure is 140/90. Slightly elevated, but not alarmingly so. Abdomen is soft, non-tender. “BP 140/90, heart sounds regular, lungs clear, abdomen soft.” Alright. Now, I'd like to review your recent lab results in more detail.
PATIENT: Oh, okay. That sounds… thorough. Is 140/90 bad? I don't really know what those numbers mean, either. My mother always kept track of all that. I just try to stay active and eat sensible things. What exactly was high in the blood work? Is it the bad cholesterol? They talk about HDL and LDL… it’s all a bit confusing.
DOCTOR: 140/90 is… not ideal. Elevated, as I said. It requires monitoring. As for your cholesterol… your total cholesterol is 230, which is above the recommended level. Your LDL – the "bad" cholesterol – is 160, also elevated. HDL – the "good" cholesterol – is 45, which is… adequate, but could be better. Triglycerides are borderline high at 180. Essentially, your cholesterol profile is suboptimal. We’ll need to discuss lifestyle modifications and potentially pharmacological intervention.
PATIENT: Oh dear. That sounds… complicated. “Suboptimal”? Is that… serious? I don’t even know what “pharmacological intervention” is. Is that… medicine? And what kind of “lifestyle modifications”? Do I have to give up cheese? I really like cheese.
DOCTOR: “Suboptimal” means it’s not where we want it to be. And yes, “pharmacological intervention” means medication. Specifically, a statin. It lowers your cholesterol. As for lifestyle modifications… Diet and exercise. Reduce saturated fats, increase fiber, regular physical activity. And… minimizing cheese intake would be prudent. It’s a significant source of saturated fat. But, to be clear, I’m not saying you have to eliminate it entirely. We can start with a low dose of Atorvastatin, 10mg daily, and reassess in three months. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Atorvastatin… that’s a mouthful! And it’s daily? For the rest of my life? What are the side effects? I’ve heard… things about medicine. And what if I don’t take it? Will it… will something bad happen? I really don’t like taking pills, Doctor. I prefer to just… keep doing what I’m doing, if that's possible. It hasn’t hurt me yet!
DOCTOR: The duration of treatment depends on your response to the medication and your overall health. It's not necessarily a lifetime commitment, but it's likely to be long-term. Side effects are generally mild – muscle aches, fatigue. Rare, but more serious complications can occur. But the risk of not treating your cholesterol – heart attack, stroke – is significantly higher. As for not taking it… your cholesterol will remain elevated, increasing your risk of cardiovascular events. It’s a matter of risk versus benefit. And frankly, “just keeping doing what you're doing” is not a viable option. I’ll write you a prescription for Atorvastatin 10mg daily. We’ll schedule a follow-up appointment in three months to recheck your levels. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That sounds… frightening. A heart attack… a stroke… I… I understand. But… could we maybe try just changing my diet first? Before starting the medicine? I could really try hard to cut back on the cheese and… and walk a little more. And maybe eat more… vegetables? I’m just… a little nervous about putting something new into my body, you know? It just feels… drastic. Could we at least try that for a few months before we jump to medicine? I promise I’ll be very careful.
DOCTOR: Very well. But understand, Ms. Geho, I am not convinced it will be sufficient. Lifestyle modifications alone rarely achieve the necessary reduction in cholesterol. However, I will concede a trial period. We'll postpone the statin prescription for three months. You will adopt a low-fat diet, increase your physical activity to at least 30 minutes per day, and… minimize cheese consumption. I will provide you with a handout outlining dietary recommendations. And, should you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath, or weakness on one side of your body, seek immediate medical attention. Is that understood?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that’s perfectly understood. I promise I’ll be very good. Thirty minutes of walking… less cheese… I can do that. And I’ll definitely watch out for… chest pain and shortness of breath. Thank you for… for being patient with me. Where will I get the handout? And… is there anything else I should be doing? Any special foods I should eat, besides vegetables?
DOCTOR: The handouts are on the table over there. They detail the specifics of a heart-healthy diet. Focus on lean proteins, fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. Consider incorporating foods rich in omega-3 fatty acids – salmon, flaxseed. And… continue to monitor your blood pressure at home, if possible. "Patient to implement lifestyle modifications, monitor BP at home." I believe that is all for today, Ms. Geho. I expect to see a significant improvement in your cholesterol levels at your follow-up appointment. Please schedule your appointment with the receptionist on your way out. Have a good day.
PATIENT: Okay, thank you, Doctor. I will. I’ll look for the handouts and schedule the appointment. And I’ll try very hard to eat more vegetables and less cheese. Thank you again for your patience.
DOCTOR: Very well. Goodbye, Ms. Geho. .
