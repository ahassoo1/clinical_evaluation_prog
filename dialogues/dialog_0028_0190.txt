DOCTOR: Right. Lilyanna Snerling, 23 years old. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, um… it’s this feeling of… well, not being quite right. I’ve been feeling unsteady, like I might fall. It’s been… a little while, I think. Honestly, dates are… difficult for me to keep track of. But it’s been enough to worry me.
DOCTOR: Unsteady… right. And how long is “a little while”?
PATIENT: Oh dear… let me think. It started… after… after everything with my husband. It’s been… several months, perhaps? Six? It’s hard to say exactly. Everything feels a bit… fuzzy, if I'm honest. I apologize for not being more precise. It just… comes and goes, this unsteadiness. Not every day. But enough to make me nervous.
DOCTOR: Several months… after… your husband. And is this unsteadiness constant when it does occur, or is it intermittent?
PATIENT: Intermittent, yes, that’s a good word. It’s not… always there. Some days I feel perfectly fine. Others… I feel like I’m walking on a boat. Or like the ground is… shifting, a little. It doesn’t last all day, thankfully. Just… comes and goes. Is that… normal? I don't mean to ask silly questions. I just… I'm not sure what is normal.
DOCTOR: “Normal” is subjective, of course. Has anything specific triggered these episodes?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. A trigger… I don’t know if I’ve noticed anything specific. It doesn’t seem to happen after… exertion, or anything like that. I work with… drills, for oil and gas. It's… physical work, but I'm used to it. It doesn’t seem related to that, thankfully. Sometimes… maybe when I’m very tired? But I’m often tired, to be honest. It's… hard to pinpoint, I’m afraid. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Vaguely. And are you experiencing any other symptoms alongside this unsteadiness?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… hmm. Let me think. Sometimes I feel a little… lightheaded, perhaps? Like I might faint, but it passes quickly. And… occasionally, a bit of a headache. Nothing terrible, just… a dull ache. I’ve also been… more forgetful than usual, but I always have been a bit spacey. I don’t know if that’s related, though. I apologize. I’m not being very helpful, am I? I wish I could explain it better.
DOCTOR: Right. Lightheadedness, headache, forgetfulness... Do you have any issues with your vision?
PATIENT: Vision… not that I’m aware of. I had my eyes checked… a few years ago, I think. Everything seems… normal. Though sometimes, when I’m feeling unsteady, things do seem a bit blurry. But I thought that was just… because I wasn’t steady! I’m not sure. It's hard to tell what’s causing what, you see. Is this the kind of thing you can… test for? I feel a bit silly worrying you with all this fuzziness.
DOCTOR: We can certainly attempt to test for things. Let's start with a basic neurological exam, then we’ll proceed from there. Can you follow my finger with your eyes without moving your head?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. I can do that. Is this… alright? I hope I’m not making this difficult. It feels strange to be… looked at like this.
DOCTOR: Your movements appear slightly jerky. And there’s a noticeable nystagmus. Now, can you tell me what year it is?
PATIENT: Nystagmus…? Oh dear. Is that bad? The year…? Let me think… It’s… August, isn't it? 20… 25? I think it’s 2025. But honestly, I've been a bit… lost, since… everything. It’s very difficult for me to keep track of dates, as I mentioned. I apologize profusely. Perhaps you should ask me something else?
DOCTOR: Right. We will need to order an MRI and some blood work. It's likely… a number of things. Do you take any medications currently?
PATIENT: Oh, um… not regularly. I took something for… anxiety, a while back. But I stopped. It didn't… really help. Just made me feel… different. Nothing else. No, no medications. I have insurance, private insurance. Is that… alright? I hope this isn't too much trouble. Is an MRI… dangerous? I apologize again for being so… vague.
DOCTOR: No, an MRI isn't dangerous. The office will schedule those appointments for you. I’m also ordering a complete blood count, a metabolic panel and a Vitamin B12 level. I'll also put in a referral to Neurology, just in case. Until we have the results, I recommend avoiding strenuous activity. Is that clear?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s… clear. An MRI, blood work, and… Neurology. And no strenuous activity. Thank you, Doctor Memmolo. I appreciate your… patience with me. I know I’m not making this easy. Should I… schedule the appointments myself, or will your office do that? And… about the results… how long will it take? I apologize for all the questions.
DOCTOR: The office will contact you to schedule the tests. Results typically take a week, but it depends on the lab. Any further questions can be directed to the front desk. I have other patients waiting. I’ll see you at your follow-up appointment.
PATIENT: Oh. Yes, of course. A week… the office will contact me. Thank you again, Doctor Memmolo. Thank you. .
