DOCTOR: Good morning, Jase. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Pfennig. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Um… well, it’s my stomach, I guess. It’s been… not good, for a bit now. Honestly, I can’t really remember when it started, exactly. Just… a while. Lots of… diarrhea, mostly. It's just… persistent, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, “persistent” is helpful. So, it's been ongoing diarrhea for some time now. When you say “a while,” could you give me a rough estimate?
PATIENT: Ugh, that’s the hard part. Maybe… a couple of months? Possibly longer? I really wish I could be more specific. It feels like it’s been on and off for ages, but getting worse recently. Does that make sense? I just… don’t keep good track of things like that.
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense, Jase. It's very common to not remember exact timelines with ongoing issues. A couple of months is a good starting point. And you mentioned it’s been getting worse recently – can you describe how it’s worse?
PATIENT: Um… well, I’m going to the bathroom a lot more. Like, a lot. And it's… looser, I guess? More watery. And sometimes… sometimes there's blood. Not a ton, but enough to notice, you know? It’s… a little scary. I think that's why I finally came in. It hadn’t been bothering me that much before, just annoying, but now…
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for sharing that, Jase. It's good you came in. Blood in the stool is definitely something we need to investigate. “A lot more” – roughly how many times a day are you going to the bathroom now, compared to what's normal for you?
PATIENT: Oh gosh… um… normally, maybe once a day? Twice if I’ve eaten something… not great. But now? Like… six or seven times. Maybe more on a bad day. It's really disruptive. I don’t even want to leave the house sometimes. I’m sorry, I know this is gross.
DOCTOR: It’s not gross at all, Jase. This is what I’m here for, and it’s important for me to understand what’s going on. Six to seven times a day is a significant change. Do you experience any pain or cramping with the diarrhea?
PATIENT: Sometimes. Not like, awful pain, but… discomfort. A lot of rumbling, and gassy. And cramping, yeah, lower stomach. It comes and goes, but it's definitely worse when I'm actually going to the bathroom. It doesn't feel like a normal stomach ache, if that makes sense? It's more… deep down.
DOCTOR: Okay, “deep down” is a good way to describe it. And the cramping associated with bowel movements. Have you noticed anything specific that makes it worse – certain foods, stress, anything like that?
PATIENT: That’s another thing I can’t really pinpoint, honestly. I feel like it happens randomly. I used to think dairy made it worse, but then I cut it out for a week and it didn’t change. I've been a little stressed lately with work, but… I’m always a little stressed. Oh! Actually… spicy food definitely makes it worse. But I like spicy food, so I eat it sometimes anyway. Stupid, I know.
DOCTOR: Okay, so spicy food is a trigger, even though you enjoy it. And stress may play a role, but it's not clear. Let's talk about your medical history for a moment. Do you have any other medical conditions?
PATIENT: Um… I think so? My husband keeps telling me about things the doctors said, but I’m terrible at remembering. I think they said something about my intestines being… inflamed? And something about not being able to eat certain foods properly. I was really sick as a kid. Is that… IBD? I think he said something like that. I get Medicare, so I've seen a few doctors over the years. Sorry, I’m probably not being very helpful.
DOCTOR: Okay, that is helpful, Jase. “Inflamed intestines” and difficulty digesting food does sound like it could be Inflammatory Bowel Disease - IBD, as you mentioned. And seeing multiple doctors with Medicare is completely understandable. Let's try to access your records to get a clearer picture of what's been diagnosed and treated previously. Just a moment while I pull up your information… Ah, here we are. It looks like you were diagnosed with Crohn’s Disease in 2020. You've had a few flare-ups over the years, and were prescribed Mesalamine. It looks like you haven’t refilled that prescription in about a year. Is that correct?
PATIENT: Oh! Right. Crohn’s. That’s it. Yes, Mesalamine… I stopped taking it. It wasn't really helping, and my husband said sometimes it stops working after a while. He does a lot of the managing of things like that, to be honest. I just… feel unwell. Is that… bad? That I stopped taking it? I didn’t really tell the doctor, I just… ran out and didn’t bother to get more.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for being honest with me, Jase. It's not necessarily "bad" that it wasn't helping, but it is important to communicate with your doctor when medications aren't effective or you stop taking them. Stopping medications without guidance can sometimes worsen the condition. Given your history of Crohn’s Disease and the current symptoms – the increased frequency of diarrhea, the blood in your stool, and the fact you discontinued your medication – it sounds like you’re likely experiencing a flare-up. We need to investigate this further to confirm and determine the best course of action. I'm going to perform a physical exam now. I'll listen to your abdomen, and I’d also like to check for any tenderness. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s okay. Whatever you think is best. I just… want to feel better. It's just… a lot. Will it be… uncomfortable?
DOCTOR: It shouldn’t be too uncomfortable, Jase. It’s a fairly standard exam. I’ll be gentle. Just let me know if anything feels painful. I’m just listening now… and pressing gently. Any tenderness here?
PATIENT: Ooh… yeah, a little bit there. Not awful, but… definitely something. It’s… hard to explain. It’s not a sharp pain, more like… pressure. Like something’s… swollen. Is that weird?
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for letting me know. Tenderness in the lower right abdomen is consistent with a potential flare-up, but we need more information. There is some mild guarding present, which means your muscles are tensing up when I press, indicating some inflammation. I don't feel any rebound tenderness at this time. Your bowel sounds are a little hyperactive, which is also consistent with inflammation. Given your history, current symptoms, and exam findings, I'm concerned about a possible Crohn's flare-up. To confirm this and rule out other possibilities, I'd like to order a few tests. First, a stool sample to check for infection and inflammation. Second, a complete blood count to check for anemia and signs of inflammation. Finally, a C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate to assess the level of inflammation in your body. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… okay. Whatever you think is necessary. Lots of tests… That's a lot. Will they… hurt? Are they expensive? My husband handles all the insurance stuff, so I don't usually know.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand your concern. The stool sample is usually painless – you’ll just need to collect a small amount in a provided container. The blood tests will involve a quick prick of a needle, which can be a little uncomfortable for a moment, but shouldn't last long. Regarding cost, your Medicare should cover a significant portion of these tests, but there may be a co-pay or deductible. I will make sure the lab submits everything to your insurance and your husband can follow up with them to determine the out-of-pocket costs. I’ll go ahead and order these tests now. The lab is located just down the hall, and they should be able to take care of everything quickly. Once the results are back, we can discuss the best course of treatment. In the meantime, I recommend staying well-hydrated and avoiding spicy foods. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No, I think… I think that’s everything. Thank you, Doctor. You've explained everything so well. I just hope it's not… too bad. I guess I'll go get the tests done then?
DOCTOR: Okay, Jase. You're very welcome. It's completely understandable to be anxious, but we'll figure out what's going on and get you feeling better. Yes, please head down to the lab. They’ll take care of you. I’ll be here if you have any questions after the tests. We can discuss the results in a couple of days once they are back. Take care, and don't hesitate to reach out if you need anything. .
