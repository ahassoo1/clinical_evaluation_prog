DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Firestone. Welcome. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, it’s my legs. They just…gave out. Not completely, mind you. More like…really weak. It started a few days ago, right after I got over a nasty cold. I haven't felt this unsteady in years, and frankly, it’s ridiculous. I’m a tour guide, you know. Can’t very well show people around if I can barely stand up.
DOCTOR: A nasty cold, and then the leg weakness… Right. And this started after you recovered from the cold, you said?
PATIENT: Yes, exactly. I felt awful during the cold – you know, the usual. Achy, congested, miserable. But once that cleared up, maybe two or three days ago, I noticed my legs feeling…funny. Like they were filled with lead. It's not painful, just…not working properly. I thought it would go away on its own, but it hasn’t. It's actually gotten a little worse, if I'm being honest. It's just... inconvenient. Really inconvenient.
DOCTOR: Inconvenient, yes. We’ll get to the bottom of it. Now, can you describe the weakness more specifically?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think. It's...both legs, evenly. Not one worse than the other. It's not like a sudden collapse, more like…difficulty starting to walk. Like needing a moment to get my bearings before I take a step. And even then, it feels… shaky. I wouldn't say I'm tripping over myself, but I'm definitely not as steady as I usually am. Climbing stairs is…a challenge, to put it mildly. And sitting up from a chair takes more effort than it should. It's... a general feeling of instability, really. It's quite bothersome.
DOCTOR: Okay, so both legs, difficulty initiating movement, shakiness, and more effort to get up from a chair. No numbness or tingling associated with it?
PATIENT: No, no tingling. Absolutely not. It's just…weakness. Like the muscles aren't cooperating. I mean, I can feel them, they’re not numb or anything like that. I’ve been trying to “push” through it, but it just doesn’t seem to be getting better. It's not like I haven’t been active, you know? I'm used to being on my feet all day. This is… unusual for me. It's really rather disruptive, to be frank. I had a tour planned for this weekend...now, what am I supposed to do?
DOCTOR: Disruptive is putting it mildly, I suppose. Alright, Ms. Firestone. Let's go through a little bit of your medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you been diagnosed with anything significant in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… Nothing major, no. I had my gallbladder removed years ago, maybe fifteen years? And I used to have terrible migraines, but those mostly disappeared after menopause. Apart from that... nothing much. High blood pressure, but it’s controlled with medication. And, of course, the usual aches and pains that come with getting older. But nothing that would explain this. I assure you. I’m a generally healthy woman. I eat reasonably well, I get enough sleep… or used to, before this started disrupting everything. It really is perplexing, don’t you think?
DOCTOR: High blood pressure, controlled. Gallbladder removal fifteen years ago, migraines in remission. And you said no other significant medical problems?
PATIENT: That's correct. No diabetes, no heart problems, no arthritis… Nothing that anyone has ever told me was a cause for concern. I had the usual childhood illnesses, measles, chickenpox, mumps… but those were decades ago! Honestly, Doctor, I’m starting to worry it’s something… strange. I’ve been reading things online – you know how it is – and it could be anything. I really prefer to leave the diagnosing to you, though. That’s what I’m paying you for, isn’t it? It's just... the weakness is becoming rather unsettling. I don't like feeling this vulnerable.
DOCTOR: Yes, well, the internet is rarely a reliable source of medical information. Let's try to remain calm, Ms. Firestone. Are you currently taking any medications for your blood pressure or anything else?
PATIENT: Yes, I am. I take Lisinopril, 20 milligrams, once a day. And… occasionally, ibuprofen for headaches, if the Lisinopril isn’t enough. But honestly, I don't take ibuprofen very often. It’s usually just the Lisinopril. And, of course, a multivitamin. I try to be sensible about things, you know? I'm not one of those people who pop pills for every little ache and pain. I’m just…concerned, because this weakness started so suddenly. And it's really throwing off my entire schedule. I had a lovely tour planned for a group from Germany… and now I don’t know what I’m going to do. It’s just… inconvenient, and frankly, a little embarrassing.
DOCTOR: Alright. Lisinopril, 20mg daily, occasional ibuprofen. And you haven’t changed dosages of your Lisinopril recently?
PATIENT: No, absolutely not. I’ve been on the same dosage for years, and my doctor – my previous doctor, before he retired – always said it was working perfectly. I haven’t adjusted anything. And, if you don’t mind me saying, I’ve been very careful about taking my medication. I set an alarm every morning, just to be sure. It’s not as if I’ve forgotten to take it. Honestly, Doctor, I’m starting to feel quite frustrated. I've given you all the information I can, and I still have no idea what's going on. It's just…this weakness is truly unsettling. And it's ruining my plans.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Firestone. Let’s do a quick physical exam. Just to get a better idea of what’s going on. It's routine. Could you please step up onto the table for me?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Very well. But please be gentle. I’m not as steady on my feet as I used to be, you know. I hope this won’t take too long. I have a rather busy afternoon, even with all my plans disrupted. I really need to get to the bottom of this weakness. It's just… incredibly inconvenient. And frankly, a little frightening.
DOCTOR: Alright. Just breathe normally for me, Ms. Firestone. Heart sounds… lungs sound clear. Any pain when I press here?
PATIENT: No, no pain at all. Just… a general weakness. It’s not a sharp pain, or anything like that. It’s just… difficult to explain. It’s like the muscles are… unresponsive. You know? Like they're not getting the signal to contract properly. And it’s both legs, evenly, as I said before. It’s not like one is worse than the other. It’s just… disconcerting, to be frank. I’m a tour guide, Doctor. I rely on my legs. This is truly… problematic. I do hope you find something. I really don’t want to be stuck at home, unable to work. It’s just… inconvenient. And expensive.
DOCTOR: Okay. Reflexes are… a bit diminished, but not absent. Strength is… noticeably reduced in both legs, about 4 out of 5. Can you try to lift each leg straight up while lying flat?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Very well. This is… more difficult than it should be. I usually have no problem with this. It feels like… resistance. Like something is preventing the leg from lifting properly. And it’s both legs, the same with both. It’s not like one is significantly weaker than the other. It’s just… disconcerting, to be frank. I'm normally quite strong for my age, you know? I do a lot of walking. I have a lovely tour planned for a group from Germany… and now I don’t know what I’m going to do. It’s just… inconvenient.
DOCTOR: Alright. Lower back feels… tender to palpation. Can you tell me if you’ve had any back pain recently, Ms. Firestone?
PATIENT: Oh! Yes, actually. Now that you mention it… a little ache. Not severe, mind you. More of a dull, nagging pain, lower back, on both sides. I just assumed it was from all the walking. You know, the usual aches and pains that come with age. I didn’t think it was anything significant. It comes and goes, really. I've just been… dismissing it. I’m a very busy woman, Doctor. I don’t have time to dwell on every little ache and pain. But now that you mention it, yes. There is a little ache in my lower back. It's not the weakness, though. The weakness is in my legs. It’s just… disconcerting. And inconvenient. I had a lovely tour planned for a group from Germany...now, what am I supposed to do?
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Firestone. Based on what you've told me and the exam, it seems likely this is related to some sort of nerve compression in your lower back, possibly sciatica. The lower back tenderness, the diminished reflexes, and the leg weakness all point in that direction. However, to be certain, we need to rule out other possibilities. I’d like to order some blood work – a complete blood count, electrolytes, kidney function, and Vitamin B12 levels – just to get a baseline. And I’d also like to get an MRI of your lower back to visualize the nerves and see if there’s any compression. Does that sound acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. An MRI? Now that sounds… expensive. And inconvenient, to be frank. But… I suppose if it’s necessary, it’s necessary. I do need to get to the bottom of this, you know? I can’t very well continue to function like this. And I certainly can’t afford to be stuck at home, unable to work. But… the cost… And the scheduling… It’s just… so much. Blood work, I can manage. That’s relatively simple. But an MRI… I’ll have to check with my insurance, of course. I have Medicare, but I’m not sure what they’ll cover. And I really don’t want to be stuck with a huge bill. But… if that’s what it takes… Very well. Blood work and an MRI. Just… please try to make the scheduling as convenient as possible. And I’ll need a referral, of course. I don’t want to have to jump through a lot of hoops. It’s just… so inconvenient.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Firestone. I understand your concerns about the cost and scheduling. I will write a referral for an MRI to the imaging center across town. They work with Medicare, and their billing department can help you understand your coverage. As for the blood work, I’ll send the orders to the lab right next door – it should be quick and easy. I’ll also have my nurse schedule a follow-up appointment for us in about a week, once we have the results of the blood work and the MRI. In the meantime, try to avoid any strenuous activity, and if the pain worsens, please don't hesitate to contact the office. I'll also prescribe you a mild muscle relaxant to help ease the discomfort. Does that sound agreeable?
PATIENT: A muscle relaxant… That sounds… potentially drowsy. I have tours planned, Doctor! I can’t very well be falling asleep on my feet. But… I suppose if it’s just a mild one… Very well. A mild muscle relaxant. And I’ll be careful about strenuous activity. Though, frankly, even walking is becoming strenuous. And I’ll be sure to contact the office if the pain worsens. Though, I do hope it doesn’t come to that. I really need to get this sorted out as quickly as possible. My tours… and frankly, my finances… depend on it. And I do hope the MRI won’t take too long to schedule. And that Medicare will cover it. It’s just… so inconvenient. Very well. Blood work, MRI, and a mild muscle relaxant. I suppose that’s a start. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your help. Though, I do wish there was a quicker, easier solution. It’s just… so inconvenient.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Firestone. We’ll do our best to get this sorted out quickly. Remember, if anything changes or worsens, please don't hesitate to contact the office. My nurse will reach out to schedule your follow-up. Get the blood work done as soon as you can. We'll take it from there. .
