DOCTOR: Hi Emiliano, good to see you today. I’m Dr. Condray. What brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Aloha, Doctor. Good to meet you too. Well, my foot… it’s been giving me trouble. A sore, mostly. A bad sore that won’t go away. It hurts to walk, you know? Been hurting for a little while now.
DOCTOR: Okay, a sore on your foot that’s been bothering you for a bit. I understand. To get a better idea of what's going on, could you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Hmm… where to start? It’s on the bottom of my foot, near my toes. Red around the edges, and… it’s kinda deep. Not bleeding much now, but it was. My daughter, she tried to help, put some cream on it. Didn’t seem to do much good. It’s just… painful when I step on it.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it's on the bottom of your foot, near the toes, red around the edges, and it was bleeding but isn’t much now. Your daughter tried some cream, but it didn't really help. You said it’s painful when you step on it. Has this happened before, Emiliano?
PATIENT: No, no, this is new. I’ve had little cuts and scrapes before, you know, from walking barefoot, but nothing like this. Nothing that wouldn’t heal in a few days. And… the doctor told me a long time ago, I have the sugar sickness. The diabetes. Maybe that has something to do with it? I forget things, sometimes. Is that what you call it, the sugar sickness?
DOCTOR: You're right to mention that, Emiliano. Diabetes can definitely affect how well wounds heal. And yes, “sugar sickness” is a common way to refer to diabetes. It’s good you remembered that. So this sore is different than anything you’ve had before, and it’s not getting better. When did you first notice it?
PATIENT: Let me think… it was maybe… two, three weeks ago? Around the time of my grandson’s birthday. He turned five. I was walking on the beach with him, and I think that’s when I first felt it. Didn’t think much of it then, just a little ache. But then it started getting redder, and… well, here we are. I’m not good with dates, you know. It feels like a long time ago now.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Emiliano. Two or three weeks ago, around your grandson’s birthday. Okay. And you were walking on the beach when you first noticed it. Besides the pain, have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Hmm… changes? Let me see… my foot feels warm sometimes. Not hot, just… warmer than the other one. And… a little bit of swelling, maybe? It’s hard to tell, because my ankles swell up sometimes anyway. Old age, you know. Everything gets a little puffy. I don't think it smells bad, if that's what you're asking. My daughter would tell me if it did.
DOCTOR: Okay, so your foot feels warmer than the other one sometimes, a little bit of swelling, and no unusual odor. That’s good to know. Now, I'm going to ask a few general health questions, if you don’t mind. Have you been having any fever, chills, or night sweats?
PATIENT: No, no fever. Not that I know of. I haven’t felt sick, just this foot. No chills either. And… no, I haven’t been sweating much at night. I sleep with a fan, because it gets warm, but that's just because of the weather. Old man gets warm easy, you know. I do sleep pretty well, though. Always have.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. No fever, chills, or night sweats. You sleep well, which is great. Now, let's talk about your medications. Are you currently taking any medications, and if so, could you tell me what they are?
PATIENT: Well, let me see… I take a pill for my blood pressure, a little white one. And… a pill for the sugar, of course. That’s a bigger pill, orange color. And… sometimes, when my arthritis acts up, I take something for that, but not every day. My daughter, she keeps track of all that. I forget the names, you know. She fills the little box for me every week. Would it be alright to ask her? She's a good girl.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Emiliano. It's very helpful that your daughter helps you with your medications. We can certainly ask her, or if you’d prefer, we can look it up in our records. Do you remember the names of any of the medications, even just a little bit?
PATIENT: I think the blood pressure one is… Lisinopril? That sounds right. And the sugar pill… Metformin? Is that right? They're hard to say, those names. And the arthritis one… I really don’t know. Sometimes it's Ibuprofen, sometimes something else. It depends on how bad my joints are hurting. I really am sorry, Doctor. I wish I could remember better. It’s just… the memory isn't what it used to be.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all, Emiliano. That’s perfectly understandable. Lisinopril for blood pressure and Metformin for diabetes—that’s very helpful. And ibuprofen for arthritis when needed. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else, like food or pollen?
PATIENT: No, no allergies that I know of. Never had a problem with food, or bees, or anything like that. My daughter always asks me when I go to the doctor, but I always tell her, "No, nothing." And I haven't found anything new that bothers me. I eat everything, pretty much. Just try to watch the sweets, you know, because of the sugar. But no allergies. I'm a pretty lucky old man, in that regard.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. That's good. Now, before we take a look at your foot, I just want to quickly ask about your family history. Are there any health problems that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. My mother, she had the sugar sickness too. And my father, he had problems with his heart. He had a weak heart, they said. And… my sister, she had high blood pressure, just like me. Not much else that I can think of. We weren't a very healthy family, to be honest. Lots of aches and pains. But that's all I can remember, Doctor. My memory… it’s just not what it used to be.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Emiliano. That gives me a good start. History of diabetes and high blood pressure in your family. Now, if you’re comfortable, I’d like to take a look at your foot. We'll start with a visual exam, and then I may need to check your circulation and sensation. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that’s fine. Go ahead. It’s just… be gentle, okay? It hurts when I put weight on it. But do what you need to do, Doctor. I trust you.
DOCTOR: Okay, Emiliano. I see the sore here on the bottom of your foot, near your toes. It is red and swollen, and appears to be a bit deep. It's tender when I touch it, which I understand. The skin around it looks a little inflamed. I'm going to check the circulation in your foot now. I'll feel for a pulse in your foot and ankle. Then, I'll check your sensation to see if you can feel light touch. This will help me assess the blood flow and nerve function in your foot. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s alright. Do what you need to do. It’s just… I hope it doesn’t hurt too much. My daughter says I have poor circulation. She worries about me, you know. Always has.
DOCTOR: Okay, Emiliano. I’m checking your pulses now. The pulse in your top of your foot is faint, and the pulse in your ankle is there but a little weaker than it should be. I’m also checking to see if you can feel light touch, and it seems you have decreased sensation around the sore. That means you might not feel pain as well in that area. I’m going to take a quick look at the other foot to compare. As expected, the pulses in your other foot are stronger, and you have normal sensation. This confirms that there's some decreased circulation and sensation in the foot with the sore. It’s important we keep a close eye on this.
PATIENT: Oh dear. That doesn’t sound good, does it? Poor circulation… my daughter warned me about that too. She said the sugar sickness can do that. Is it bad, Doctor? Is it serious? I’m a bit worried now.
DOCTOR: It's good you're aware of the potential issues with circulation, Emiliano, and your daughter is right to be concerned. The diabetes can affect blood flow, and that's what we're seeing here. It’s not necessarily immediately serious, but it does mean we need to be very careful. Poor circulation and decreased sensation make you more prone to developing complications with wounds, and slower healing. I'm going to be upfront with you. Given the decreased circulation and sensation, and the fact that the wound isn't healing, I'm concerned about the possibility of an infection. It’s important to rule that out. To get a better understanding of what's going on, I recommend we order some blood tests to check for signs of infection and to assess your blood sugar levels. I also think we should get an x-ray of your foot to rule out any underlying bone infection. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Tests… and an x-ray? Oh dear. That sounds… serious. But if that’s what you think is best, Doctor, then yes, alright. Do what you need to do. I just want this sore to get better, you know? I want to be able to walk again without pain. My grandson misses playing with me on the beach. Is it going to hurt? The tests, and the x-ray?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Emiliano. It’s good we’re being proactive. The blood tests are just a simple blood draw – a little pinch, really. The x-ray is completely painless. You'll just stand or sit while the machine takes a picture of your foot. It doesn't involve any radiation that would be harmful. The tests will help us determine if there is an infection present and guide our treatment plan. Depending on the results, we may need to start you on antibiotics, or other medications to improve circulation. I’m going to have my nurse draw the blood now, and then we’ll get an order for the x-ray. While we're waiting for the results, it’s very important that you avoid putting weight on that foot as much as possible. Do you have a cane or walker you can use?
PATIENT: No, no cane or walker. I just… try to take it easy. My daughter keeps telling me to be careful. She’ll probably bring me one, though. She always does. And… what about the shoes? Should I wear different shoes? I wear slippers mostly, around the house. Is that alright? I try to keep the foot clean, you know. Wash it every day.
DOCTOR: That’s good that you’re keeping it clean, Emiliano. Avoiding weight on it is key right now. Slippers are okay for around the house, but they don't offer much support. If you have a pair of supportive shoes, like sneakers, that would be even better. We’ll talk more about footwear after we get the test results. For now, focus on resting and keeping the wound clean and dry. If you notice any signs of worsening infection – increased redness, swelling, pain, pus, or fever – please call my office immediately, even if it's after hours. I’m going to have my nurse come in and draw the blood now. She’ll explain the process to you. Then we’ll get the x-ray ordered. Do you have any questions for me before she comes in?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. You’ve explained everything very clearly, Doctor. I’m a little worried, but… I trust you. Just… please do everything you can to help me get better. My grandson is waiting for me on the beach. .
DOCTOR: I understand, Emiliano. And I promise you, I will do everything I can. We'll work through this together. My nurse will be right in.
