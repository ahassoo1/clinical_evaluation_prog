DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. AlCORTA. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Neeraj AUELUA. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… Al-COR-ta, actually. And it’s my vision, you see. It’s just… not what it used to be. Things are becoming… indistinct. A bit blurry around the edges, if you will. Not a complete loss, mind you, but concerning enough to warrant a visit, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Ah, Al-COR-ta, my apologies! It’s easy to mishear names. And yes, certainly sounds like it’s worth looking into. “Indistinct” and “blurry around the edges” – that’s helpful. To get a better picture of what’s going on, could you tell me a little more about when you first noticed this change in your vision?
PATIENT: Well, that’s a difficult question. I suppose it wasn’t a sudden thing, not like flipping a switch. More of a… gradual decline. Perhaps six months ago, I started noticing reading small print was more taxing. Now, even the television isn't as crisp as it once was. I do spend a fair amount of time outdoors, admittedly. Hunting, mostly. But I always thought my eyes were… robust. A good Cherokee eye, if you catch my meaning.
DOCTOR: I do catch your meaning – a good, strong constitution is always a plus! And it's good you mention the outdoor activities; that's definitely something we'll want to consider. A gradual decline over six months is useful information. So, it started with difficulty reading small print, and now it's affecting your distance vision with the television?
PATIENT: Precisely. And it’s not just distance, Doctor. It’s… depth perception, too. It makes judging distances difficult. Not ideal when one is, shall we say, procuring one's own supper. It’s a nuisance, really. A perfectly capable man, brought low by failing eyesight. I haven’t had a proper check-up in… well, a very long time. I always figured it would sort itself out.
DOCTOR: I understand. Depth perception issues are definitely concerning, especially with your activities. And you're right to get it checked out now, even if it feels like it might have resolved on its own. To get a better understanding of your overall health, could you tell me a little bit about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Past medical history… hmm. Not much to report, truthfully. I had the usual childhood illnesses, measles, mumps… nothing serious. A broken arm once, falling out of a tree, trying to retrieve a particularly stubborn raccoon. Beyond that… nothing. I’ve always been a… vigorous specimen, as I mentioned. No chronic conditions. No surgeries. No regular medications. I did have a bout of… indigestion a few years back, but that cleared up with a bit of baking soda. Oh, and a divorce. Does that count as a medical condition? A draining one, certainly.
DOCTOR: I appreciate the honesty, Mr. AlCORTA. And no, while emotionally taxing, I don’t believe a divorce qualifies as a medical condition. It sounds like you've been quite healthy overall. No chronic conditions, no surgeries, no medications – that’s good to know. Now, what about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history… that’s a bit more… complicated. My mother’s side, the Cherokee side, they tended to live long lives, generally. But… they didn’t exactly have a fondness for doctors. Lots of home remedies, herbal teas, that sort of thing. I vaguely recall my grandmother mentioning something about “weak eyes” running in the family, but it was always spoken of in hushed tones, like a shameful secret. My father’s side… well, he wasn’t around much. Didn’t pay much attention to such things. So, not much concrete information, I’m afraid. Mostly whispers and folklore.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. AlCORTA. It’s common for family medical history to be incomplete, especially with cultural factors playing a role. "Whispers of weak eyes" is a starting point, though. We'll proceed as if there could be some genetic predisposition. Now, just to cover all the bases, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies, Doctor. None that I’m aware of, at least. I’ve eaten everything from pickled quail eggs to fried grasshoppers. My ex-wife tried to poison me with exotic fruit once, just to see if I’d notice. Didn't even flinch. I’ve been stung by bees, bitten by snakes… a little discomfort, perhaps, but never a full-blown allergic reaction. I consider myself quite robust, as I’ve mentioned.
DOCTOR: Remarkable! A truly robust constitution indeed. No allergies is good to know. Okay, Mr. AlCORTA. We've covered a lot of ground. Now, let's talk about your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Absolutely not, Doctor. Never touched a cigarette in my life. Alcohol… a glass of wine with dinner occasionally, perhaps, but I find it clouds my judgment. And recreational drugs… utterly reprehensible. A waste of time and energy. I’ve always been a man of… discipline. Focused on providing for myself, honing my skills. Not indulging in… frivolities. I do enjoy a good cup of coffee, though. Several, actually. But I hardly consider that a vice.
DOCTOR: Excellent. No smoking, minimal alcohol, no recreational drugs… that's all very positive. And coffee doesn’t count, in my professional opinion! Alright, Mr. AlCORTA, we’ve gone through quite a bit of your history. Now, if you don't mind, I'd like to perform a quick physical exam, focusing on your eyes. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, proceed. I suppose poking and prodding is inevitable. Though, I must warn you, my eyesight may not be cooperating fully. I can see well enough to get by, but discerning fine details… that's where the trouble lies. Do try not to poke too hard, if you would.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. AlCORTA. We'll take it slow and be gentle. And I'll certainly work with your current vision limitations. First, I’m just going to check your visual acuity – how well you can see at various distances. Can you read this chart for me?
PATIENT: There… that one. And… that one. I can make out the top few lines relatively easily, Doctor. But it becomes… indistinct further down. It's not a complete blur, mind you. More like… faded letters. A bit like looking through a dirty window. I used to be able to read anything, you know. Even the smallest print. It's… disconcerting.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s helpful. It appears your vision is around 20/40 in both eyes at this distance. Which indicates a moderate degree of visual impairment. Now, let's check your peripheral vision. Could you focus on this point here, and tell me when you see anything in your side vision?
PATIENT: There… something flickering on the left. Faint. Like a shadow. And… now something on the right, a little brighter. It’s not a clear image, Doctor. More like… vague shapes. A bit like looking through a veil. It’s difficult to pinpoint exactly what I’m seeing. It’s… imprecise. Honestly, I don’t trust my judgment much at this point. My eyesight’s been so unreliable lately. It’s… unnerving.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Mr. AlCORTA. It’s perfectly understandable to feel that way. You’re accurately describing what you’re seeing, and that’s what’s important. It sounds like there may be some peripheral vision loss, but we need to investigate further to determine the extent of it. Now, I'm going to use this penlight to check your pupils and their reaction to light. Just look straight ahead and relax.
PATIENT: A bit bright, Doctor. But… tolerable. I can feel the constriction, of course. They… shrink as the light shines in. But… they don't seem to recover as quickly as they used to. A bit… sluggish, if you will. It’s subtle, mind you. But noticeable. Is that… concerning? Honestly, I feel like I’m falling apart. A perfectly capable man, reduced to… needing assistance to see. It’s… disheartening.
DOCTOR: It’s not necessarily alarming, Mr. AlCORTA, but it is something we’ll want to investigate. A slightly sluggish pupillary response can be indicative of a few different things. Now, I’m going to gently examine your eyes with this ophthalmoscope. It allows me to look at the back of your eye, the retina. It won’t hurt, but you may see a bright light. Just focus on a fixed point straight ahead. Okay… I’m seeing some mild drusen in the macula of both eyes, which is common with age. But I also notice some slight pallor of the optic nerve, which requires further evaluation. It's not dramatic, but it is something we need to investigate.
PATIENT: Drusen… pallor… those are… concerning terms, aren't they? I confess, Doctor, I'm not entirely familiar with medical jargon. Does this mean… serious trouble? Will I go blind? I have… responsibilities, you see. I need to be able to provide for myself. Honestly, I feel a bit… helpless. A perfectly capable man, reduced to… relying on doctors to tell me what's wrong with me. It's… unsettling. Please, tell me the truth. What are my options?
DOCTOR: Mr. AlCORTA, it's completely understandable to be anxious. Those terms can be concerning, but it’s important not to jump to conclusions. Drusen are common age-related changes and often don't cause significant vision loss. However, the slight pallor of the optic nerve does warrant further investigation. It’s too early to say definitively whether you're at risk of going blind. We need to rule out other possible causes for the optic nerve changes. Here's what I recommend: I'm going to order a visual field test to assess your peripheral vision more accurately. I also want to order an optical coherence tomography scan, which will give us a detailed image of the layers of your retina. And finally, I’m going to refer you to an ophthalmologist – a specialist in eye care – for a comprehensive evaluation. They can perform more specialized tests and provide a definitive diagnosis and treatment plan. Does that sound acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That… sounds reasonable. Tests, a specialist… it's better to know, I suppose, even if the news isn’t good. I confess, I’ve always been a bit… skeptical of doctors. Too much jargon, too many tests. But… you seem… thorough. And you haven’t dismissed my concerns. Very well. Proceed with the tests, the specialist… whatever you deem necessary. I trust your judgment. Although… I must warn you, I don’t have insurance. Will that… complicate matters? A perfectly capable man, suddenly burdened with medical bills… it’s… disheartening.
DOCTOR: I understand your skepticism, and I appreciate your trust, Mr. AlCORTA. It's important to me that you feel comfortable and informed every step of the way. And you’re right to ask about insurance. Lack of insurance can complicate things, but we'll do everything we can to help. I’ll have my staff research any financial assistance programs or sliding-scale options available in the area. We can also discuss potential payment plans. There are also some charitable organizations that may be able to help with the cost of eye care. We will work through this together. I’ll get the orders for the visual field test and OCT scan sent to the lab. My staff will contact you to schedule those appointments. And I’ll get the referral to the ophthalmologist processed. They will contact you directly to schedule an appointment as well. In the meantime, if you experience any sudden changes in your vision – such as a new onset of floaters, flashes of light, or a curtain-like shadow over your vision – please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any other questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I believe that covers everything. Tests, a specialist, financial assistance… I appreciate your thoroughness, and your… understanding. It’s a weight off my shoulders, knowing that something is being done. Honestly, I was rather frightened, to be frank. A perfectly capable man, facing the prospect of blindness… it’s… unsettling. But… you’ve put my mind at ease. Very well. I’ll await my appointments. And thank you, Doctor. Truly. I suppose I’ll be going now. Unless you have anything further? .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. AlCORTA. I’m glad I could put your mind at ease, and I'll do everything I can to help you navigate this process. Don’t hesitate to contact my office if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. Take care, and I look forward to seeing you at your follow-up appointments.
