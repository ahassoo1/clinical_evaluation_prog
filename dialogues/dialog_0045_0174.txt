DOCTOR: Good morning, Mrs. Derasmo. I’m Dr. Billman. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Billman. Well, to be frank, I haven’t been…myself lately. It’s a bit difficult to explain, but I just feel…down. Terribly down, really. And I thought it best to get it checked out, before it gets worse. I haven’t much patience for things these days, if you understand.
DOCTOR: I understand. Feeling “down” can mean a lot of things. And it’s good you’re getting it checked out. Now, when you say "not yourself," can you be a little more specific?
PATIENT: Specific… hmm. Let me see. It’s not a sudden thing, you understand. It’s been… creeping up on me for a few months now, I suppose. I just don’t enjoy things like I used to. The garden, my book club… even a good cup of tea doesn’t quite hit the spot. I find myself… just sitting. A lot. And I sleep terribly. Or rather, I don’t sleep enough. It's all rather tiresome, really. Does that make any sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes sense. A loss of interest in things you normally enjoy, changes in sleep… Those are definitely things we need to explore. Now, have you experienced any changes in your appetite?
PATIENT: Appetite… well, not really. I still eat, you understand. I make sure of that. A good, balanced diet is important, even when one isn't feeling one's best. Though I don’t crave anything, if that’s what you mean. Food is…fuel, mostly. Not a pleasure. Perhaps a little less of it, if I'm being honest, but nothing drastic. I wouldn’t say I’ve lost weight, certainly. Do you need me to be specific about what I eat? I find all this detail rather… tedious.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. No need to get worked up about specifics just yet. Just trying to get a full picture. Now, have you noticed any difficulty concentrating?
PATIENT: Oh, yes! Absolutely. My mind… it wanders. Terribly wanders. I used to be able to read a whole book in a sitting, you understand. Now, I read a page and… what was I reading? It’s frightfully frustrating. I find myself rereading the same sentence several times. It’s making things…difficult. It interferes with everything, really. Even a simple conversation, sometimes. Do you understand? It’s rather embarrassing.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. Difficulty concentrating, loss of interest, sleep disturbances… I’m just pulling up your EHR now to see your medical history. Let's see... Height 180cm, weight 78kg. Okay. Now, have you experienced any feelings of hopelessness or… have you had any thoughts of harming yourself?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That’s… a rather direct question, Doctor. Hopelessness… well, there are days, you understand. Days when it all seems rather pointless. But harming myself? No, absolutely not. Never. I’m a practical woman. That’s not a solution to anything. It’s just… exhausting, this feeling. But I wouldn't… do anything like that. Really. It's just… a grey feeling. A very persistent, grey feeling. I hope that answers your question.
DOCTOR: Yes, thank you, Mrs. Derasmo. That's helpful. Now, let's talk about your past medical history. Do you have any chronic health conditions that we should be aware of?
PATIENT: Chronic conditions… hmm. Nothing major, you understand. I had a bit of trouble with my knees a few years back – skiing, you see. But it was treated. Physiotherapy, mostly. And my blood pressure sometimes runs a little high, but it’s managed with medication. Nothing that interferes with my daily life, generally. I'm quite strong, you understand, for my age. Used to be a lifeguard, and ski patrol. Very demanding jobs. Though I am retired now, of course. Is that helpful? I haven’t been to a doctor in years, truthfully. I prefer to avoid it, if possible.
DOCTOR: Alright. Knee issues, managed hypertension… good to know. Now, are you currently taking any medications for your blood pressure, or anything else for that matter?
PATIENT: Yes, I am. Just one, for my blood pressure. Amlodipine, I believe it’s called. Five milligrams, once a day. And sometimes a little something for my knees, when they flare up - ibuprofen, but only as needed. I try to avoid taking too many pills, you understand. I believe in moderation. Is that sufficient? I always write down what I take, just in case. I’ll see if I can recall where I put it... Oh, bother. This is exactly why I dislike being asked these things. It’s all terribly inconvenient.
DOCTOR: Alright, Amlodipine 5mg, ibuprofen as needed. Now, let’s talk about your family history. Has anyone in your family experienced any mental health conditions like depression or anxiety?
PATIENT: Mental health… hmm. That’s a difficult question, Doctor. My mother… she was a bit of a worrier, you understand. Always fretting about something. And my uncle… he was a bit… withdrawn. Kept to himself a lot. But no one was ever diagnosed, if that's what you mean. We didn't really talk about such things in those days. It was considered a bit… shameful. Is that helpful? I don’t believe anyone ever sought professional help. We just… coped. As best we could. It’s a rather complicated family, truthfully. A lot of strong personalities.
DOCTOR: Alright. History of worry and withdrawal in the family… good to know. Now, lastly, let’s talk about your social history. Are you currently working?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I am retired, as I mentioned. Ski patrol was… demanding work, you understand. I gave it up a few years ago. Now I mostly… keep to myself. I used to have a very active social life, but… things have changed. I used to enjoy my book club, but even that… doesn’t hold my interest anymore. My husband… well, my ex-husband, he had a very active social life, even after we divorced. He's probably off somewhere enjoying himself, while I'm sitting here. It’s rather… lonely, truthfully. Is that what you wanted to know? I find it all rather depressing, talking about it, if I’m honest. Perhaps we can move on?
DOCTOR: Yes, thank you, Mrs. Derasmo. That’s sufficient for now. Now, I’m going to do a brief physical exam just to rule out any underlying medical causes for how you’re feeling. We’ll check your blood pressure, pulse, listen to your heart and lungs, and do a basic neurological exam. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Oh, very well. If you must. Honestly, I dislike being poked and prodded. But if it will get to the bottom of things… yes, alright. Please be quick about it, if you don’t mind. I have… errands to run. Though I doubt I have the energy for them. Just please, be gentle. My knees aren't what they used to be, you understand. And try not to make a fuss. I really dislike hospitals and doctors. It all makes me terribly anxious.
DOCTOR: Alright. Just a quick exam, I promise. Let's start with your blood pressure. Please take a seat here. And yes, I will be gentle.
PATIENT: Very well. Get it over with, then. I haven’t got all day, you understand. And do be careful with the cuff. It always feels so tight. Honestly, I find the whole process rather… intrusive.
DOCTOR: Okay, your blood pressure is 148/92. A little elevated, but not dramatically so. Pulse is 78, regular. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath for me... and exhale. Heart sounds are normal, lungs are clear. Now, let's just do a quick neurological exam. Could you follow my finger with your eyes?
PATIENT: Yes, I can see your finger. Though it’s rather blurry, if I’m honest. My eyesight isn’t what it used to be, you understand. I should probably get new glasses. It’s just… another thing to add to the list. Keep moving it around, Doctor. Just so you can be certain. Honestly, I find this rather tiresome. All this poking and prodding… It doesn’t tell you anything useful, if you ask me.
DOCTOR: Alright. Motor strength appears normal. Now, can you squeeze my hands?
PATIENT: Yes, I can squeeze your hand. Though it’s rather cold. Honestly, you doctors always have such chilly hands. And please, be gentle. I don’t want to strain anything. It’s just… everything feels a bit stiff these days, you understand? Especially in the mornings. I used to be able to do anything, but now… it’s all a bit of an effort. Are we finished yet? I’m starting to feel rather uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s all for the physical exam. Everything appears physically normal. Given your symptoms – loss of interest, difficulty concentrating, sleep disturbances, fatigue, and the family history – it’s possible you are experiencing symptoms of depression. However, we need to rule out other potential causes, like thyroid problems or vitamin deficiencies. I’m going to order some blood work, including a complete blood count, thyroid panel, and vitamin D level. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Blood work… Honestly, it never ends, does it? Well, if you must. But please, don’t keep me waiting too long for the results. I don’t have the patience for endless tests and waiting rooms. And what if it is depression? What then? More pills, I suppose. I really dislike the idea of taking medication. It always makes me feel… sluggish. But if you think it's necessary… alright, go ahead and order the tests. Just please, be quick about it. And tell me where I need to go. I haven’t been to a lab in years, you understand. It’s all rather… daunting.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’ve ordered the blood work. You can go to LabCorp on Elm Street. The results usually take 2-3 business days. Once we have those, we can discuss a plan. And yes, medication is an option, but it’s not the only one. We can also explore therapy. It's important to remember that depression is a treatable condition. We'll figure out the best approach together. In the meantime, I'm going to give you a handout with some information about depression and some resources for support. And if you're feeling overwhelmed or have any thoughts of harming yourself, please don't hesitate to call the crisis hotline number listed here. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Crisis hotline… Honestly. Well, I suppose it’s good to know. Therapy… I’ve never been one for talking about my feelings. I prefer to deal with things myself. But if you think it might help… I suppose I can consider it. Though I doubt it. It all sounds rather… tedious. Is that everything? I really must be going. I have… things to attend to. Though what those things are, I can’t quite recall at the moment. Just tell me where to pick up the results, and I’ll be on my way. Honestly, this has been rather exhausting.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s everything for today. You can pick up the results at the LabCorp front desk, or they can also email them to you – would you prefer that?
PATIENT: Email, yes. That would be preferable. Less fuss. Just tell me the address. And please, don’t keep me waiting too long for the email. Honestly, I’ve had quite enough of waiting today. Now, if you'll excuse me...
DOCTOR: Certainly. The email address is labcorpresults@example.com. And the address for LabCorp on Elm Street is 123 Elm Street, just a few blocks from here. Mrs. Derasmo, if your symptoms worsen, or you have any concerning thoughts, please don’t hesitate to reach out. I’ll be in touch once the results are in. Have a good day.
