DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Lason, good to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, it’s about these… spells, I guess you could call them. My wife, she’s the one who really insisted I come. She says I just… blank out sometimes. Not all the time, mind you. And I remember everything after, but… it’s unsettling for her, I suppose. She worries.
DOCTOR: “Spells,” huh?
PATIENT: Don’t look at me like that. I know it sounds silly. It’s just… like a fog rolls in. I’ll be talking, or doing something, and then… nothing. A few minutes gone. Then I’m right as rain again. Perfectly normal. It’s her who gets worked up. She thinks it's… well, never you mind what she thinks.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, Mr. Lason, even if it seems silly to you, it's good your wife is concerned and brought you in. We take these things seriously. So, let’s try to get a better picture of what's happening. When did you first start noticing these… "fogs," as you call them?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think… It started… maybe six months ago? Around the time the market garden started doing really well, actually. Lots of extra work, bending and kneeling, that sort of thing. I figured it was just being tired, you know? An old man doing too much. But it kept happening, even when I was resting. It's not every day, mind you. Perhaps once or twice a week, sometimes not for a whole month.
DOCTOR: Okay, so about six months ago, coinciding with increased activity. And it's intermittent, occurring maybe once or twice a week, but sometimes longer gaps. Can you describe what it feels like when this happens?
PATIENT: Feels like… well, it’s not painful. Just… empty. Like the television is on, but there’s no signal. I can see things, hear things, but the words… they don't stick. Like trying to grab smoke. And I feel… lost. Not scared, exactly, just… unmoored. Then, snap, it’s gone. Everything comes back, and I usually don't even realize how long I was… out of it. My wife tells me.
DOCTOR: Okay, "empty," "no signal," words don't stick, feeling "unmoored." And it's your wife who usually notices it. How long do these episodes seem to last, according to her?
PATIENT: She says… usually just a few minutes. Five, maybe ten at the most. But sometimes she says it seems longer. She gets flustered, you know? Doesn’t always keep good track of time when I’m… not myself. She'll be trying to get my attention, asking me questions, and I just… stare right through her. It's embarrassing, really. She worries terribly about dementia, but I haven't forgotten anything important! I can still tell you the price of tiling materials from ten years ago.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you experience anything else during these episodes?
PATIENT: Else? Like what? I don’t have… visions or anything. No shaking, no confusion afterwards, not really. Just… a blank spot in my memory. Sometimes, I think I might be a little clumsy right before it happens. Knocking things over, that sort of thing. But that could just be me getting old, couldn’t it? I always was a bit of a klutz.
DOCTOR: Okay, no other symptoms, perhaps a little clumsiness beforehand. Let's talk about your medical history for a bit. Do you have any other health problems that we should be aware of?
PATIENT: Well, I have my share. High blood pressure, the doctor's been telling me to watch my salt intake for years. And my knees, they ache somethin’ awful, especially in the cold weather. I’ve got Medicare, so I see a specialist for that when it gets bad. Oh, and I had a bit of a problem with my prostate a few years back, but they sorted that out. Nothing major, nothing that would make me… forget things, surely.
DOCTOR: High blood pressure, knee pain, and a history of prostate issues. Okay. Any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Let me think… Oh, yes. I had my appendix out when I was a boy. A long time ago. And… hmm. My wife reminds me. I had a small surgery on my knee, about five years ago, to clean up some cartilage. That’s about it, I think. Nothing else that I can recall.
DOCTOR: Appendix removed in childhood, knee surgery five years ago. What about medications?
PATIENT: Just a few. I take a pill for the blood pressure, every morning. Lisinopril, I think it’s called. And something for the pain in my knees, when it gets really bad. Naproxen, I believe. That’s about it. Nothing fancy. I don’t like taking pills if I can avoid it. They make me feel… sluggish.
DOCTOR: Lisinopril for blood pressure and naproxen as needed for knee pain. Any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. My wife always asks, of course, but I haven’t ever had a reaction to anything. I can eat anything… well, almost anything. I'm not fond of cilantro, but that’s just a matter of taste, isn’t it? Not an allergy.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Lason. And finally, could you tell me a little bit about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history… Hmm. My father, he was a strong man, lived to be eighty. He didn’t have any of these… spells. My mother… she died young, a heart condition. My brother, he’s still alive, but he lives in Phnom Penh, and we don't see each other much. He’s always been… a bit scattered, if I’m honest. Not much for remembering things. But I don’t think that runs in the family. He’s just… always been like that.
DOCTOR: Okay. Alright, Mr. Lason. This is helpful. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical exam, just to get a better sense of things. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Fine. Just get on with it. I’ve got tiling to lay, you know. Can’t sit around all day. But… hurry it up a bit, if you would. I’m not as young as I used to be.
DOCTOR: Of course. I’ll be as quick as I can. Let’s start with your blood pressure and pulse. Blood pressure is a little elevated, 145 over 88. Pulse is regular at 72. Heart sounds are normal, lungs are clear. Now, let's check your reflexes. Reflexes are a little diminished, but that's not uncommon at your age. Finally, I’m going to do a quick neurological assessment. Can you follow my finger with your eyes?
PATIENT: Yes, I can. What’s this all for, exactly? I told you, I feel perfectly fine most of the time. My wife is just… overly cautious. It’s a woman’s nature, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Just routine, Mr. Lason. Strength is normal. Walk is a little unsteady, but not significantly so. Now, can you repeat these three words for me: apple, table, penny?
PATIENT: Apple… table… penny. There. Is that enough? I’m starting to feel a bit foolish.
DOCTOR: Okay. Good. And now, can you tell me what year it is?
PATIENT: What year it is? Really? It's 2025, of course! Don't you keep up with the calendar? It's August, naturally. My wife and I were just discussing the heat wave last week.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Lason. Based on what you’ve told me, and the brief exam, it sounds like you're experiencing what are likely transient ischemic attacks, or TIAs. These are sometimes called "mini-strokes." It’s possible these episodes are caused by a temporary blockage of blood flow to the brain. The symptoms you're describing—the blank spells, the clumsiness, the difficulty remembering—are all consistent with TIAs.
PATIENT: Mini-strokes? What are you talking about? I haven't had a stroke! I feel fine! My wife… she's probably just imagining things. Transient… what did you say? This sounds… serious. Are you sure? I've always been a healthy man. I lay tile all day, every day!
DOCTOR: Mr. Lason, I understand your skepticism, and I appreciate you being forthright about how you’re feeling. However, based on the information we have, a TIA is a very real possibility, and it's something we need to take seriously. While the symptoms are temporary, a TIA can be a warning sign of a full stroke, and it's essential to investigate further. It doesn't mean you will have a stroke, but it significantly increases your risk. We need to rule out any underlying causes and take steps to prevent one. I'm going to order some blood tests and a CT scan of your brain to get a clearer picture of what’s going on. And I’m going to refer you to a neurologist for a more comprehensive evaluation. Would you agree to that?
PATIENT: A neurologist? CT scan? This is… more than I expected. Blood tests, alright. I suppose I can do that. But a scan… that sounds… invasive. Is it absolutely necessary? My wife… she’ll be beside herself. But… if you think it’s best. If it’s to make sure I don't… well. Alright. Do what you think is best. But hurry, please. I've got work to do. And tell me… is it serious? Really serious?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Lason. The CT scan is non-invasive; it simply uses X-rays to create images of your brain. It’s the best way to rule out other potential causes for your symptoms, like a tumor or bleeding. And yes, a TIA is serious, because it can lead to a full stroke, which can cause permanent disability. But the good news is that we caught this early, and with proper diagnosis and treatment, we can significantly reduce your risk. I'll explain everything to your wife, and we can schedule these tests as soon as possible. I'm also going to prescribe you a low-dose aspirin, which can help prevent blood clots. I'll write the orders now. We’ll discuss the results of the tests and the neurologist appointment at your follow-up. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Aspirin… well, alright. My wife will be relieved, I suppose, to hear you're taking it seriously. She’s a worrier, that one. A good woman, but… a worrier. Alright, do what you think is best. Schedule the tests, the neurologist… just… let me know when. I’ve got a deadline, you know. But thank you… for explaining it all. It’s… a lot to take in.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Lason. I'll have my staff schedule everything and contact your wife to discuss the details. Here are the prescriptions for the aspirin, and the orders for the blood tests and CT scan. If you experience any new or worsening symptoms—weakness, difficulty speaking, vision changes—go to the nearest emergency room immediately. And please, try not to worry too much. We’re going to get to the bottom of this. We will see you at your follow-up appointment in one week.
