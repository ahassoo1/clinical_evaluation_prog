DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Schaust. I’m Dr. GonzalezPerez. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s… it’s a bit difficult to explain. I’ve been feeling weaker, gradually, over the last few months. And my eyelids… they feel heavy, and they’re drooping a little. It’s starting to bother me, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Weakness and drooping eyelids, you say. And this has been developing over months, not suddenly?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. Not suddenly at all. It started… I suppose around February, maybe March? It was just a little tiredness at first, easily dismissed. But it’s gotten worse, you know? It’s not like I can’t do things, but everything takes more effort now. I find myself needing to sit down more often.
DOCTOR: I see. And is this weakness generalized, or is it more pronounced in certain muscle groups?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. Hmm… I hadn’t really thought about it that specifically. It feels… all over, I suppose. But now that you mention it, it’s probably more noticeable in my arms and legs. Lifting things feels harder, and I get tired walking longer distances. My face… feels a bit weak too, sometimes. It’s hard to describe, really. I don’t know if that helps?
DOCTOR: It does, actually. And have you noticed any changes in your vision?
PATIENT: Changes in my vision… not that I’ve consciously noticed, no. Everything seems… normal, as far as I can tell. Although, now that you ask, maybe things seem a little blurry sometimes? But I wear glasses already, so I just assumed it was my prescription needing adjustment. I had an eye exam last year, though.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you experiencing any difficulty with swallowing or speaking?
PATIENT: No, thankfully not. Swallowing and speaking are fine. No problems there at all. It’s just the weakness and the eyelids. And the tiredness, of course. It's the combination, I think, that's worrying me.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let's move on to some other questions, then. Have you had any fever, weight loss, or night sweats recently?
PATIENT: No, no fever. And my weight… I haven’t really been keeping track, to be honest. It might have gone down a little, but I haven’t weighed myself recently enough to say for sure. And no night sweats either. I sleep… normally, I suppose. Although, I do wake up quite a lot. But that's probably just stress. I'm divorced, you see. It's been… difficult.
DOCTOR: I see. And are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: No, I’m not. I try to avoid them if I can. I haven’t really needed to take anything regularly, ever. Just the occasional pain reliever for a headache, if that counts. And I don’t have any allergies that I’m aware of.
DOCTOR: Very good. Now, let’s discuss your past medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any significant illnesses in the past?
PATIENT: No, not really. I had chickenpox as a child, of course. And I broke my arm once when I was a teenager. But nothing… serious. I’ve generally been quite healthy, to be honest. That’s why this is so worrying, you see. It's not like I'm used to feeling unwell.
DOCTOR: And your family history?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a bit harder. My mother… she had some heart trouble later in life, I believe. And my father… he had diabetes. But beyond that, I don't really know. We weren't very close, to be honest, and I never really asked about family medical history. Is that bad? I feel like I should know more about that.
DOCTOR: It is less than ideal. Alright. And finally, your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, no smoking. I tried it once or twice in my youth, but I didn’t enjoy it. I drink… occasionally. A glass of wine with dinner, perhaps, once or twice a week. And definitely no recreational drugs. I wouldn't dream of it. I live a pretty quiet life, actually. I work, I… I try to keep busy. That's all.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, Mr. Schaust, I’d like to conduct a brief physical examination. I’ll need to check your reflexes, muscle strength, and perform a neurological assessment. If you’ll just lie back on the examination table, we can get started.
PATIENT: Alright, yes, of course. That sounds… sensible. Just let me know if you need me to do anything specific. I'm not very good at this sort of thing.
DOCTOR: Alright, let’s start with your reflexes. Left knee… good. Right knee… good. Now, please squeeze my hands as tightly as you can. A little weak on both sides, but not alarmingly so. Now, can you push against my hands?
PATIENT: I… I’m trying. It feels a bit harder than it used to. It's not that I can't push, it just… requires more effort. And it feels a bit… shaky. Is that normal?
DOCTOR: The weakness is present, as you’ve noted. And I’m observing some ptosis – drooping of your eyelids – bilaterally. Pupil reaction to light is normal. Now, please follow my finger with your eyes. Eye movements are smooth, no nystagmus observed. Now, let’s check your muscle strength in your arms and legs. Can you lift your arms against resistance?
PATIENT: This… this is getting harder. My arms feel… heavy. It’s not a sharp pain, just… a lot of effort for very little movement. Is that… is that bad? It really feels like I’m fighting against something.
DOCTOR: Leg strength is also diminished, but not severely. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Alright, Mr. Schaust. Thank you for your patience. Based on the physical examination and your reported symptoms, I suspect a possible neuromuscular disorder. However, we need further testing to confirm the diagnosis. I’m going to order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a thyroid-stimulating hormone test. I also want to order an electromyography – or EMG – to assess the electrical activity of your muscles.
PATIENT: A… a neuromuscular disorder? That sounds… very serious. What does that mean exactly? And an EMG… is that painful? I don’t like needles. Is there anything else it could be? I just… I'm a bit worried now, to be honest. All this talk of disorders… it's a bit overwhelming.
DOCTOR: It could be a number of things, Mr. Schaust. It’s too early to jump to conclusions. A neuromuscular disorder simply means there’s an issue affecting your muscles or the nerves that control them. The EMG will help us pinpoint the exact problem. It involves inserting a small needle into your muscles to record their electrical activity. There will be some mild discomfort, like a brief muscle twitch, but it is generally well-tolerated. We’ll also need to rule out other possibilities, such as thyroid problems or vitamin deficiencies. Frankly, your lack of detailed medical history makes accurate diagnosis more challenging. I’ll arrange for these tests to be completed as soon as possible. In the meantime, I recommend you get adequate rest and maintain a healthy diet. And try not to dwell on worst-case scenarios. I'll have the lab requisitions printed for you. Given your uninsured status, I suggest inquiring with the laboratory about potential financial assistance programs.
PATIENT: Financial assistance… yes, of course. I hadn’t even thought of that. It’s just… everything is happening so fast. And to be honest, Doctor, I’m a bit overwhelmed. I’ll… I’ll try to remain calm and get the tests done as soon as possible. But… is there anything I should be looking out for in the meantime? Anything that would indicate a more urgent problem? And… thank you for your time. I suppose.
DOCTOR: If you experience any difficulty breathing, double vision, or significant weakness that interferes with your ability to perform daily tasks, go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Those are rare occurrences, but it’s best to be prepared. Here are the lab requisitions and the contact information for the laboratory. The results will take approximately one week to come back. I’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results once they are available. Please ensure you have any relevant insurance information ready for that appointment. .
