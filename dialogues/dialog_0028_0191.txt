DOCTOR: Right. Mrs. Shaub, is it?
PATIENT: Yes, that is correct. Tierney Shaub. It’s nice to meet you, Doctor… Memmolo, is it? I hope I’m pronouncing that right.
DOCTOR: Memmolo is fine. Look, I have a rather full schedule today, so let’s get straight to it. What brings you in?
PATIENT: Well, I requested a test for… HIV. It's something I wanted to get checked, just to be sure, you understand. A preventative measure, really. I don’t have any specific concerns, just… peace of mind.
DOCTOR: An HIV test… preventative, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, exactly. My husband and I… we’ve been together a long time, but with everything you hear about these days, it just seemed… prudent. Is that the right word? I want to be certain, for both of us.
DOCTOR: Prudent. Yes, well. And you haven't had any… risky behaviors?
PATIENT: Risky behaviors? Oh, no, not at all! Goodness, no. We’ve been very faithful to each other. I’m just… a cautious person, I suppose. And it’s good to be informed, isn’t it? I haven't been with anyone else, ever. It's just… better to know, even if it's just to put my mind at ease.
DOCTOR: Right. So, a completely unnecessary test because you’re… cautious. Very well. I suppose we can accommodate. Have you ever been tested before?
PATIENT: No, I haven't. This would be my first time. I always meant to, truthfully, but life gets in the way, you know? Work, family… It just never seemed like the right time until now. Is there anything special I need to do to prepare?
DOCTOR: No, not particularly. It’s a simple blood draw. We’ll take a sample, send it to the lab, and you’ll get the results in a week or so. Though, frankly, I doubt it will be anything to worry about, given your… lifestyle. Let’s get it over with.
PATIENT: A week or so? Alright, that sounds reasonable. Though, I do wish you wouldn't phrase it like it's a waste of your time, Doctor. It’s important to me, even if it seems… unnecessary to you. But, yes, let's get it done. Where do we go from here?
DOCTOR: The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood. She’ll explain the process. It’s standard procedure. And honestly, Mrs. Shaub, I have other patients waiting who have actual medical concerns. I’m just trying to be efficient.
PATIENT: I understand you're busy, Doctor. I apologize for taking up your time. I just… I wanted to be proactive about my health. Very well, I’ll wait for the nurse. Thank you. I hope she’s a little more patient.
DOCTOR: Of course.
