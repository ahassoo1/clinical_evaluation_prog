DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Abdollahi. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Alanes. It's lovely to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. My name is Lindra. My… my husband and I, we are thinking maybe a… a place for me to live. A senior place. They need… they need a doctor to say I am okay to go there. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Ms. Abdollahi. You need a medical assessment to determine if you're suitable for residency in a senior living facility. I can certainly help with that. To start, could you tell me a little bit about your current health?
PATIENT: Hmm… current health… I am… mostly okay. I get tired sometimes, you know? Like, after I work a long shift at the bar. But I work! I am a bartender, you see. Been doing that a long time. My knees… they bother me a little, especially when it is cold. And… oh! I take a pill for my blood pressure. Just one, every morning. Is that… is that what you want to know?
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful, Ms. Abdollahi. Working as a bartender is certainly keeping you active! And it's good you’re aware of your body and what it's telling you. Let's break things down a bit. You mentioned fatigue, knee pain, and blood pressure medication. First, regarding the fatigue – could you describe how long you’ve been feeling tired, and does anything specific seem to make it worse or better?
PATIENT: Hmm… how long… a few years, maybe? It gets worse when I don't sleep good. And… working long nights, of course. When I have a busy night at the bar, I am very tired the next day. But… resting helps. A little. My husband, he says I need to slow down, but I like my job! It keeps me busy, you know? I don’t like to sit still. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. It sounds like your fatigue is likely related to your activity level and sleep schedule. We'll definitely explore that further. Now, about your knees… can you tell me more about the pain?
PATIENT: The knees… they ache. Mostly when it’s cold. Or if I stand too long. Like, at the bar, if it's a busy night. Sometimes they feel… stiff, you know? Like they don't bend good. It's not… it’s not a sharp pain. Just… achey. And… sometimes they click. Is that bad? I don’t know if clicking is bad.
DOCTOR: Okay, achey knees that are worse with cold and prolonged standing, and some clicking… that gives me a better picture. Clicking isn't always bad, but we'll take a look. Before we move on, let's quickly review your medical history. Do you have any other medical conditions that I should be aware of – anything you've been diagnosed with in the past?
PATIENT: Hmm… medical history… Let me think. I had… a little bit of trouble with my sugar a long time ago. The doctor said pre-diabetes, I think? But I watched my diet, and it went away. Nothing else… I broke my arm when I was a little girl, but that’s… a long time ago! My husband, he knows more about this stuff, maybe. He always remembers things. I mostly just… feel okay. Usually.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of pre-diabetes that resolved with dietary changes, and a broken arm in childhood. That's good information. We'll want to get a more detailed history, but for now, let's move on to medications. You mentioned a blood pressure pill – can you tell me the name of it, and the dosage?
PATIENT: Oh… the name… hmm. Let me see… I have it in my purse… … Here! It says… Lisinopril. Ten milligrams. I take one every morning with my breakfast. Is that enough information? I am not good with remembering names, you know? But I take it every day, I promise.
DOCTOR: Yes, Lisinopril 10mg daily is very helpful, thank you. And it's good to know you’re consistent with taking it. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Not that I know of. I eat everything! My husband, he is allergic to cats. But I love cats! I don’t have any allergies to medicine. I have taken lots of medicine in my life. Nothing bad ever happened. I think I am okay. Do you want me to ask my husband? He might remember something.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. No known allergies is helpful. We can always ask your husband later if you think of anything. Okay, Ms. Abdollahi, let’s move on to a quick physical exam. I’d like to check your blood pressure, heart rate, lungs, and briefly examine your knees. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that is okay. Whatever you need to do. My husband says I need to listen to the doctor more anyway! You can check whatever you want. I hope my knees aren't too bad. They bother me sometimes, you know?
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you don’t mind, please have a seat on the table. I’ll start by checking your blood pressure and heart rate. Your blood pressure is 138/82, and your heart rate is 76 beats per minute. That’s a little elevated, but not significantly concerning given your activity level. Now, let’s listen to your lungs. Please take some deep breaths for me. Your lungs sound clear. Finally, let’s take a look at your knees. Could you please bend them for me?
PATIENT: Okay. Oh… that… that makes a little noise. You hear that clicking? It happens every time. And… it’s a little stiff. I try to bend them further, but it’s hard. I am not very flexible, you know? I used to dance when I was young, but that was a long time ago. Is that okay? Should I bend them more?
DOCTOR: That's alright, Ms. Abdollahi, please don’t force anything. I can see and hear the clicking, and I note the mild stiffness. There's some tenderness to palpation on the inner aspect of both knees. No significant swelling or warmth. Range of motion is slightly limited, but not severely. Alright, Ms. Abdollahi, thank you for letting me examine you. Now, to get a clearer picture of your overall health, I'd like to order a few simple blood tests. These will check your blood sugar, kidney function, and cholesterol levels. We should also get a basic metabolic panel to evaluate your electrolytes. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Blood tests… yes, that is okay. Whatever you think is best. My husband says I need to get more tests, so maybe you are right. He worries a lot. Will they… will they hurt? I don’t like needles very much. But I will do it, if you think it’s important. Just… try to be quick, okay?
DOCTOR: I understand your concern about needles, Ms. Abdollahi. We'll be as quick and gentle as possible. A phlebotomist will draw a small amount of blood from your arm – it’s a brief pinch, and it shouldn’t take long at all. The results will give us a better understanding of your overall health and help determine if you’re a suitable candidate for residency in a senior living facility. While we wait for the results, do you have any questions for me?
PATIENT: Hmm… questions… let me think. I guess… what if the tests… what if something is wrong? Will I have to stay in the hospital? I don’t want to stay in the hospital. I just want to know if I can go to the nice place. The place with the activities and the garden. That’s all. Is that a silly question?
DOCTOR: That’s not silly at all, Ms. Abdollahi. It’s a very valid concern. The tests are just to give us a baseline and help us make an informed decision. Most likely, the results will be normal or show minor issues that can be managed with lifestyle changes or medication. If anything significant is found, we’ll discuss it thoroughly and create a plan together. It's unlikely you'd need to stay in the hospital solely based on these tests. We'd only consider hospitalization if there were serious concerns that required immediate attention. Right now, let's focus on getting the tests done. They will give us more information and allow us to make the best decision for your health and well-being. Do you have any other questions or concerns before we proceed?
PATIENT: No… I think that is all. Just… please be quick with the needle. My husband is waiting in the car. He gets worried if I am gone too long. He is a good man. And… thank you for explaining everything so clearly. You are very kind.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Abdollahi. It's my pleasure. I will certainly make sure the phlebotomist is as quick and gentle as possible. I’ll have the phlebotomist come in now. They’ll explain the procedure to you. I'll review the results as soon as they're available and we'll discuss them together. Thank you for coming in today.
PATIENT: Okay. Thank you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Abdollahi. I’ll let you get settled with the phlebotomist.
