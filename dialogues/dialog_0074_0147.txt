DOCTOR: Good morning, Amy. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Reisig. It’s nice to meet you. To start, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Well, I’ve noticed a lump in my lower abdomen, and it’s been… concerning me. I thought it best to get it checked out.
DOCTOR: I understand. A lump is certainly something we want to investigate. To help me understand what’s going on, could you tell me a bit more about it?
PATIENT: Of course. It’s… hard to say exactly when I first noticed it, maybe a few weeks ago? It doesn’t really hurt, not usually. Sometimes a dull ache, but it’s not constant. It feels… firm, but not rock-hard, if that makes sense. And it seems to be getting slightly bigger, though it might just be my imagination.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. A few weeks, firm but not rock-hard, and a possible increase in size… I appreciate you describing it so clearly. Does anything specific seem to make the ache worse—like, after physical activity, or straining, or even just at certain times of the day?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. I don’t think so, honestly. I’ve been doing a lot of gardening lately, bending and lifting, but the ache doesn’t seem to be directly related to that. And it doesn't seem to be worse at any particular time of the day either. It’s just… there, occasionally. It's more of a worry than actual pain, if I’m being honest.
DOCTOR: I completely understand. It’s good you’re addressing your concerns. And it’s good that it’s not consistently painful, but we still want to figure out what's causing it. Now, have you noticed any other changes along with the lump?
PATIENT: Let me think… no, not really. No changes in my bowel habits, no weight loss, no fever or anything like that. My appetite is normal. I haven’t felt any nausea or fatigue either. Just the lump. I suppose I have been a little more anxious than usual, but I attribute that to worrying about the lump itself.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s good to know. No other systemic symptoms are helpful. Now, let’s talk a bit about your medical history. Do you have any known medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No, not really. I’ve always been fairly healthy. I had the usual childhood illnesses, but nothing major. I don’t have any allergies that I know of, and I’m not currently taking any medications. My wife keeps telling me to take a daily vitamin, but I haven't gotten around to it yet!
DOCTOR: That's good to hear about your overall health. Vitamins are a good idea, but let’s focus on what’s happening now. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything other than routine childhood things?
PATIENT: No, never. No surgeries, no hospital stays. I've been very lucky, I suppose. I’ve broken a bone or two as a kid, a wrist and an arm, but those were both treated at the doctor's office, no need for a hospital. Just the usual scrapes and bruises that come with life.
DOCTOR: That's excellent. And what about your family history?
PATIENT: That's a bit… complicated. My mother passed away a few years ago, and I don’t have much information about her medical history. She didn’t really talk about it. My father is still alive, but he lives back in Palestine and we haven’t seen each other in many years. I know he has some high blood pressure, but that’s about all I know. No history of cancer that I'm aware of, on either side of the family.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Amy. It’s understandable that the information is limited. We’ll proceed with what we have. Now, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Of course. Well, as I mentioned, I enjoy gardening. It keeps me active. I also do a fair bit of walking. I’m married, and my wife and I enjoy cooking together. I eat a pretty balanced diet, lots of fresh fruits and vegetables. I don't smoke, and I only drink alcohol occasionally – maybe a glass of wine with dinner sometimes. I wouldn't say I have a particularly stressful life, though things can get busy.
DOCTOR: That all sounds very healthy, Amy. Now, just to be thorough, let's quickly review any allergies you may have. You mentioned none earlier, but sometimes people forget things when they're anxious. Do you have any reactions to medications, food, insect bites, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, I’m quite certain. I really don't have any allergies. I’ve eaten all sorts of things throughout my life, and I’ve never had a reaction. I’ve been stung by bees a few times while gardening, but just the usual localized pain, nothing serious. And no problems with medications either. I’m very careful about what I put into my body.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Alright, Amy, thank you for providing all of that information. Now, I’d like to perform a physical exam to get a better understanding of what’s going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, absolutely. That sounds good. Please, go ahead. I trust your judgement.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you could lie down on the exam table, that would be great. I’m going to start by palpating your abdomen, feeling for the lump and assessing its characteristics. I’ll also be listening to your bowel sounds and checking for any tenderness. Please let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. Okay. I am noting a firm, non-tender mass in the lower abdomen, approximately 2-3 centimeters in diameter. It is not fixed to the underlying tissues and does not appear to be causing any significant discomfort during palpation. Your bowel sounds are normal. Do you feel any pain when I apply pressure here?
PATIENT: No, that doesn’t hurt. It feels… the same as it always does, just a bit of pressure. Not painful at all. It's a little strange feeling it being poked at, but no pain. It doesn't feel any bigger than it did before, either.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about when I take a deeper breath?
PATIENT: No, that doesn’t change anything. It doesn't move or feel any different when I breathe in deeply. Just the same pressure as before.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs just to get a complete picture. Your heart and lungs sound clear. I don’t hear any abnormalities there. Based on the physical exam and your history, the lump is concerning, but it doesn't present as an acute emergency. However, to get a definitive diagnosis, I'd like to order some imaging tests. I recommend an abdominal ultrasound to get a better look at the lump and determine its nature. Would that be acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds very sensible. An ultrasound seems like a good idea. Absolutely, I agree. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I want to know what it is.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I’ll write the order for the ultrasound now. The radiology department will contact you to schedule an appointment. In the meantime, if you experience any sudden pain, fever, nausea, vomiting, or any significant changes in your bowel habits, please contact the clinic immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this point, Amy?
PATIENT: No, I think you’ve covered everything very thoroughly, Doctor. You’ve put my mind at ease, knowing we’re taking steps to figure it out. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me and explain everything so clearly.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Amy. I'm glad I could help. I’ll also send a copy of these notes to your primary care physician. We’ll review the ultrasound results as soon as they’re available and discuss the next steps at that time. Do you need a work note for any time off, or anything like that?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s very thoughtful of you to ask. No, I don't need a work note at the moment. I can still manage my gardening, thankfully. But thank you for offering. I think that’s everything. Thank you again for your time and expertise, Doctor.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Amy. Please don't hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any concerns before your ultrasound appointment. We're here to help. Have a good day.
PATIENT: .
