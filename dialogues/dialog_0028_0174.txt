DOCTOR: Right. Mrs. Derasmo, is it?
PATIENT: Yes, that is correct. Nani Derasmo. Though, please, call me Nani. And thank you for seeing me. I do hope this won't take too long, Doctor… Memmolo, is it? I have a great many things to attend to this afternoon.
DOCTOR: Memmolo, yes. And you're quite welcome… though, I assure you, I prioritize efficiency. Now, let's get straight to it. What brings you in today, Nani?
PATIENT: Well, to be frank, Doctor, I’ve just been… feeling down. Not myself, you understand? It’s been going on for a little while now, and frankly, it’s starting to interfere with things. I used to be so active, always something to do… Now, I just… don't feel like doing much of anything at all. It's quite bothersome, really.
DOCTOR: "Feeling down," you say. And for how long precisely has this been occurring?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… It’s difficult to pinpoint exactly. Perhaps… three, maybe four months now? It started gradually, you understand. A little less energy here, a little less interest there. It wasn't sudden, like a cold. More… a slow fading, like the colours of an old photograph. It’s hard to say for sure, truly. Time does seem to slip away these days.
DOCTOR: Three or four months… a gradual onset. And has anything specific occurred during that timeframe that might have triggered this, Nani?
PATIENT: Hmm… specific? That’s a good question. My divorce was finalized about six months ago, perhaps a little more. That was upsetting, of course. But that’s… settled. Water under the bridge, as they say. Nothing else springs to mind, no major losses or… incidents. Just a general… lack of enthusiasm, I suppose. It's all rather frustrating.
DOCTOR: The divorce...yes. Significant life change. And besides the general lack of enthusiasm, are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Oh dear. Let me see… I haven’t been sleeping as well as I used to. Not that I can’t sleep, just… restless. I wake up several times during the night. And my appetite… it’s not what it used to be. I find I’m not hungry very often. Everything tastes a bit… bland. Though I do still manage to eat, just not with the same enjoyment. I suppose that’s all. I haven’t been ill, no aches or pains, nothing like that.
DOCTOR: Restless sleep, decreased appetite… Any changes in weight, Nani?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Actually, now that you mention it, my clothes are feeling a bit looser. I haven’t weighed myself recently, truth be told, but I would estimate… perhaps five, maybe ten pounds lost? It’s not deliberate, I assure you. I’m not one for dieting. I simply haven’t been feeling hungry enough to maintain my usual weight. It’s all rather unsettling.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any family history of… let's say, similar issues?
PATIENT: Similar issues… Hmm. My mother, God rest her soul, she was a worrier, always prone to melancholy. Not that she was ever formally… diagnosed, as they say nowadays. But she had her down days, certainly. And my brother, on my father’s side, he’s a bit of a recluse. Doesn’t socialize much, keeps to himself. Whether that’s… related, I couldn't say. It’s not something we discuss openly, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: I see. And are you currently taking any medications, Nani?
PATIENT: Just the usual things, Doctor. A little something for my blood pressure, which is well controlled, and a vitamin D supplement, the doctor recommended it a few winters ago. Nothing else. I pride myself on being quite healthy, all things considered. I used to be a very strong swimmer, you know. Still am, though not as often as I’d like.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’m going to do a brief physical exam. Nothing extensive. Just to rule out any underlying physical causes for your symptoms. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. That sounds perfectly reasonable, Doctor. The sooner we rule things out, the better. I trust your judgement. Though, I must warn you, I’ve always had a rather… strong grip. From years of lifeguarding, you see. Don't be startled.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let’s start with your blood pressure. 130 over 80. Not bad. Now, let me listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear. Thyroid feels normal. Now, a quick neurological exam… Reflexes are good. Coordination appears normal. Everything appears physically normal.
PATIENT: Well, that’s… reassuring, I suppose. Though I confess, I was hoping for a simple explanation. A vitamin deficiency, perhaps? Something easily remedied. It seems… rather more complicated than that, doesn’t it? What does this mean, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Based on your symptoms and the physical exam, and given the duration, it sounds like you may be experiencing symptoms of depression. However, a diagnosis requires a more thorough evaluation. I’m going to order some blood work to rule out any other potential causes, such as thyroid issues or vitamin deficiencies, despite my initial assessment. But realistically, Nani, it’s unlikely to be a physical cause.
PATIENT: Depression… Oh dear. That sounds… rather serious. I’ve always considered myself a strong person, capable of handling anything life throws my way. To think I might be… depressed. It’s… unsettling. What does this… evaluation entail, Doctor? Will I have to… talk about things?
DOCTOR: Yes, it involves talking. A psychological evaluation, to be precise. It helps determine the severity of your symptoms and the best course of treatment. I can refer you to a psychiatrist, or a qualified therapist. It's standard procedure. I will also give you a questionnaire to fill out. It’s… fairly detailed. And I’m going to prescribe a low dose of an antidepressant to start, while we await the results of the blood work and schedule your evaluation. Do you have any objections?
PATIENT: An antidepressant… Oh, goodness. That sounds… rather strong, doesn’t it? I’ve always been hesitant about taking medication, preferring natural remedies whenever possible. But… I suppose if it’s necessary. No, I don't have any objections, exactly. But I confess, the thought of talking… and taking medication… It’s all a bit overwhelming. Will this… change me, Doctor? Will I still be… me?
DOCTOR: It won't change you, Nani. It will help restore your brain chemistry to a more normal state. These medications are generally well-tolerated. And therapy… it’s simply a safe space to process your feelings and develop coping mechanisms. Here’s the prescription for Sertraline, 25mg daily. Start with one tablet. And here's the questionnaire. Please fill it out as honestly as possible. I’ll schedule you a follow-up appointment in two weeks to discuss the results of the blood work and your questionnaire. The referral information for a psychiatrist is also attached. I suggest scheduling an appointment as soon as possible. Do you have any other questions?
PATIENT: No… I don't think so. Sertraline… A psychiatrist… It’s… a lot to take in. Very well, Doctor. Thank you… I suppose. I’ll… try to be as honest as possible with the questionnaire. And I'll look into scheduling an appointment with the psychiatrist. I appreciate your… assistance. Though I must say, I still feel rather… apprehensive. .
DOCTOR: Very well. Try to get some rest. .
