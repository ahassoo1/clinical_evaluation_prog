DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Ms. Sladen. I’m Dr. Hembrey. It says here you’re with Medicare, and we're located out here in the rural clinic. Thank you for coming in today. Now, can you tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Oh, hi Doctor. It’s Sladen, actually – Mykeisha Sladen. And you’re welcome. I’m here ‘cause my blood pressure’s been a bit high lately. My regular doctor just retired and suggested I find someone new to keep an eye on it.
DOCTOR: Sladen, yes, my apologies. And thank you for clarifying. “A bit high” is rather vague, Ms. Sladen. Can you be more specific?
PATIENT: Hmm... well, my neighbour, Bernice, she has one of them machines, you know, for your arm? She let me use it a couple times, and it was showing numbers over 140, I think. Maybe 150, once or twice. It scared me a little, to be honest. I don't usually bother with numbers if I don't have to!
DOCTOR: I see. While I appreciate Bernice's generosity, home blood pressure machines aren’t always accurate, Ms. Sladen. It's best to have a proper reading taken in a clinical setting. However, those numbers are elevated. Do you experience any symptoms – headaches, dizziness, blurred vision, chest pain – with these higher readings?
PATIENT: No, not really. That’s what’s so strange! I feel… normal, mostly. Maybe a little tired sometimes, but I just figured that was from work. I do a lot of walking, you know, with my job, so I always thought that was why. But no headaches or anything like that. It’s just… the machine worried me, and I didn't want to take chances.
DOCTOR: Walking is good, certainly. But it doesn't preclude hypertension. And, frankly, relying on a neighbor's equipment is… suboptimal. Let’s get a baseline reading here, and then we’ll discuss your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with high blood pressure before, or been prescribed any medications for it?
PATIENT: No, never. This is all new to me. No doctor ever told me anything about high blood pressure before. And I don’t take any pills, not regularly, anyway. Just… you know, painkillers if I pull a muscle at work, but that's it. Really rare, though.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's start with a quick physical exam, and then we can delve into your history a bit more. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, and check your pulse. Please remove your jacket, and I’ll take your blood pressure now. Just relax, and try to breathe normally.
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds good. I'm a little nervous, if you don't mind me saying. Numbers always make me anxious. But I’m tryin’ to relax. Just tell me if anything feels… weird.
DOCTOR: Very good. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Blood pressure is… 148 over 92. Elevated, as we suspected. Your pulse is 78 and regular. I'm also going to palpate your thyroid and check your reflexes. Everything appears normal there, but we'll need to run some further tests to get a clearer picture.
PATIENT: Okay... 148, huh? That sounds… bad. I didn’t even know what a normal number was. So, what kind of tests? Like, blood work? And will they take a lot of time? I got a shift to cover on Friday, so… I don’t want to miss that if I can help it.
DOCTOR: “Bad” is a relative term, Ms. Sladen. It is higher than ideal, and requires attention. Yes, we'll need some blood work – a complete metabolic panel, lipid panel, and a urinalysis, at minimum. We also need an EKG to assess your heart function. As for time, the blood work should be relatively quick. The EKG will take perhaps fifteen minutes. As for your shift, I understand your concerns, but your health is paramount. We'll schedule these tests as efficiently as possible. Do you have any allergies to latex or other medical materials I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No allergies, not that I know of. I've had shots before, and never had a problem. And you're right, I guess. Health is important. I just… I depend on that money. But fifteen minutes for the heart thing sounds alright. And blood work… I can probably squeeze that in before my shift, maybe. What are you lookin' for with all this testing, anyway? Is it somethin' serious?
DOCTOR: We are looking for the cause of your elevated blood pressure, Ms. Sladen. There are many possibilities – kidney issues, hormonal imbalances, cardiovascular problems. The tests will help rule out or identify any underlying medical conditions. It could be essential hypertension – meaning there's no identifiable cause – but we must investigate thoroughly. We will also be looking at the overall health of your heart and the possibility of any damage from the elevated blood pressure. Do you have a family history of hypertension, heart disease, stroke, or kidney problems?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. My grandmother, on my mother’s side, she had high blood pressure, I think. And my uncle, he had a stroke a few years back. But that’s all I really know. My mother never really talked much about family health stuff. She passed away when I was young, so… I don’t have a lot of information. Is a stroke what happens when your blood pressure gets too high? Is that what I’m lookin’ at if I don’t get this under control?
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Sladen, a stroke is a potential consequence of uncontrolled hypertension. But let’s not jump to conclusions. We are taking proactive steps now. Your grandmother’s history is relevant, and we'll document that. The tests will give us a clearer picture of your risk factors. I am ordering the blood work and an EKG to be done this afternoon. Once we have those results, we can discuss treatment options. Are you currently taking any herbal supplements or over-the-counter medications, even occasionally?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. I don't really believe in all that herbal stuff, to be honest. And like I said, I only take painkillers if I really need to. Mostly just ibuprofen, for muscle aches. So, what happens after the tests? Will you call me with the results? Or do I need to schedule another appointment? I’m a bit worried about all this… I haven’t been to a doctor in ages.
DOCTOR: The lab results will typically be available within 24-48 hours. I will have the nurse call you with the results, and we will schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them in detail, regardless of what they show. It’s important to have a comprehensive plan in place. And I understand your apprehension, Ms. Sladen, but proactive health management is crucial. While we wait for the results, I advise you to reduce your sodium intake, and avoid strenuous activity. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds… manageable. Reduce salt, no hard work. I can do that. Um… what about coffee? I drink a cup or two every morning, just to wake up. Is that bad for my blood pressure? And… is there anything else I should be doin' right now? Like, anything I can eat, or avoid, besides salt? I wanna get started on this.
DOCTOR: Caffeine can temporarily raise your blood pressure, Ms. Sladen, so limiting your coffee intake is advisable. And while waiting for the test results, focus on a diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and lean protein. Avoid processed foods, sugary drinks, and excessive alcohol consumption. It is important to understand that these are temporary adjustments. We need a more definitive diagnosis before we can formulate a long-term treatment plan. However, these measures can contribute to overall health. The nurse will provide you with a handout detailing a DASH diet – Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension. Now, I believe that is all for today. Please, schedule a follow-up appointment with the receptionist before you leave. Do you have any further questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you, Doctor. And thanks for explainin’ everything so clearly. I was really scared at first, but I feel a little better now. I'll go talk to the receptionist now. .
