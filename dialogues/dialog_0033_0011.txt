DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Honcoop. I'm Dr. Dechene. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you. Look, I ain't got all day. Just need a paper signed, somethin’ about… fixin’ myself up a little. Cosmetic, they called it. Don't rightly remember all the details, to be honest. The young lady on the phone said you was the one to see. Can we just get this over with?
DOCTOR: "Fixing yourself up a little"...right. And you said the phone operator suggested I handle this?
PATIENT: That's right. She said somethin' about…a procedure. A face thing. Look, I work with towers, climbin’ and such. Ain't got time for long stories or fancy talk. Just need the okay so I can get it done and be on my way. Is that possible? I don't even know why I need your permission for somethin’ like this, but…here I am.
DOCTOR: A “face thing,” climbing towers... Alright. Well, Mr. Honcoop, even cosmetic procedures carry risks, and as your physician, I need to understand what you're hoping to have done, and why. It's not simply about signing a paper. Do you recall where you're planning to have this done?
PATIENT: Some place… in the city. A clinic, I reckon. It was advertised on the radio. Truth be told, I don’t pay much attention to those things. They promised good results, that’s all I know. Look, I just want to look…presentable. It's a personal matter. You don't need to know all the specifics. Can't you just ask them what I'm havin’ done? They explained it all when I scheduled it.
DOCTOR: I’m accessing your EHR now… unfortunately, it's…remarkably sparse. No records of consultations, no information regarding this planned procedure. Mr. Honcoop, with all due respect, I need to know what they are proposing. A radio advertisement is not a substitute for a proper medical evaluation. Do you have any paperwork from this clinic?
PATIENT: Paperwork? Hmm… Now that you mention it… I might have somethin’ in the truck. A flyer, maybe. But it’s a mess in there, I warn ya. Tools and such. I was in a hurry when I scheduled it, didn't bother with keepin’ track of things. Honestly, I expected this to be a simple formality. Is it really necessary to make such a fuss? My time is valuable, you know.
DOCTOR: "Valuable," yes, I understand. But your health is paramount, Mr. Honcoop. And proceeding with an unknown procedure without my knowledge – or frankly, any documented medical history – is simply irresponsible. Could you retrieve that flyer?
PATIENT: Fine, fine. But don't expect miracles. It's probably all marketing fluff anyway. Give me a moment. The truck's parked out back. This is a waste of a perfectly good afternoon, if you ask me.
