DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Luft. I am Dr. Jules. Now, please, tell me what brings you in today. Try to be concise; my schedule is rather…full.
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s…cancer, like the paperwork says. I was told to come in for a check-up, but I don't really know what that means, exactly.
DOCTOR: "Cancer," you say. Yes, I see here a preliminary report…rather alarming, frankly. And you are unsure what a “check-up” entails?
PATIENT: Well, yes. I…I don’t spend much time in doctor’s offices. My husband, he always took care of things like this. He passed last year. So… I’m a little lost, if you don’t mind. What will you be doing today?
DOCTOR: Very well. A check-up, in this instance, will involve a thorough review of your medical history – which, according to this, is…sparse. We’ll perform a physical examination, and I will likely order some additional tests to confirm the initial findings and determine the extent of the…situation. It’s standard procedure. Do you have any allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I…I don't really have any reactions to anything. And the medical history is sparse because, like I said, my husband always handled all that. I just…went along. Is that okay? Will that make things harder?
DOCTOR: It complicates matters, certainly. We operate on facts, Ms. Luft, not…convenience. Very well. Let's begin with a brief review of your current symptoms. Aside from the…report, are you experiencing any discomfort?
PATIENT: Yes. I get…tired. All the time, really. Even when I’ve slept a long time. And my appetite isn’t very good. Things just…don’t taste right anymore. And sometimes, I have a pain in my side. It comes and goes, but it’s…sharp.
DOCTOR: Tiredness, loss of appetite, and…sharp pain. Which side, precisely?
PATIENT: My right side. Lower down, like…where my ribs are. It’s hard to explain. It doesn’t hurt all the time, but when it does, it takes my breath away. It’s worse when I move around a lot.
DOCTOR: I see. And have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Um…well, I’ve been losing weight, I think. My clothes feel…looser. And I’ve been getting a lot of night sweats. I wake up soaked, sometimes. It’s…uncomfortable. I didn’t think much of it, honestly. I just thought it was the weather.
DOCTOR: Weight loss, night sweats… These are all pertinent details. Now, let's move on to your past medical history, although I suspect it will be brief. Have you ever been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No, never. Not even as a child. Just the usual colds and things, but nothing serious enough for a hospital. My husband, he had his appendix out when he was young, and he broke his arm once, but that was it. I…I’m not very good at remembering dates and things like that, if that’s okay. Would it help if you asked about…specific things?
DOCTOR: Dates are hardly crucial at this juncture, Ms. Luft. We're establishing a baseline. Have you ever had any major surgeries?
PATIENT: No, never. Like I said, I've just…never needed them. I’ve been pretty healthy, I think. Until…now. This whole thing is very frightening, Doctor. I don’t even know where to begin.
DOCTOR: Very well. We will proceed systematically. Now, a question about your family history. Do you know of any instances of cancer in your immediate family – parents, siblings?
PATIENT: Um…my mother passed away when I was young, from…a sickness. I don’t really remember what it was. My father…he had heart trouble. And I have a brother, but we haven’t spoken in years. I don’t know anything about his health. Is that…bad? Is it important to know? I feel like I’m failing at this already.
DOCTOR: A lack of information is rarely optimal, Ms. Luft. But we will proceed. Let’s discuss your social habits, briefly. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: No, never. My husband didn't smoke, either. We always tried to stay healthy. I…I don’t understand why this is happening. What could I have done to cause this?
DOCTOR: Causes are rarely straightforward, Ms. Luft. Now, do you drink alcohol?
PATIENT: No, not really. Maybe a glass of wine on special occasions, like Christmas, but that’s it. I’m not much of a drinker. It makes me feel…funny. And my husband didn’t drink much, either. He preferred coffee.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, I think it is time for a brief physical examination. Please lie back on the examination table. I will need to listen to your heart and lungs, and palpate your abdomen. Do you have any…sensitivities I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. But… could you be gentle, please? I’m a little nervous, Doctor. And… I don’t really like being touched. Not unexpectedly, anyway. Is that okay? I just… it makes me uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Of course. I will proceed with the utmost care. Your heart rate is slightly elevated, and your breathing appears…shallow. There is some tenderness in the right lower quadrant. It’s not acute, but it is…present. We will need to order some blood work and a CT scan to get a clearer picture of what is happening. I’ll have my assistant draw some blood now.
PATIENT: Okay. That sounds…scary. A CT scan… is that like an X-ray? Will it hurt? I…I’m not very good with needles, either. Would you mind if you…explained everything to me as you go? I just…I need to know what’s happening. I'm starting to feel a little faint.
DOCTOR: A CT scan utilizes X-rays, yes, but it provides a much more detailed image. It is not particularly painful, though you will need to lie still for a short period. As for the blood work, it is a standard procedure. I understand your anxiety, Ms. Luft. My assistant will explain the process thoroughly. We will take things one step at a time. Do you feel lightheaded currently?
PATIENT: Yes, a little. And my stomach feels… queasy. Maybe if I sit for a minute. I just…it’s all happening so fast. It feels like I’m back in a hospital, and I’ve never even been in a hospital before. Do you think… do you think it's very bad? I know you probably can’t tell me anything yet, but… it would be nice to know if I should be preparing for the worst.
DOCTOR: Ms. Luft, it is far too early to speculate. Jumping to conclusions will serve no purpose. I assure you, we will gather the necessary information and formulate a plan. Let me summon my assistant to draw some blood, and then we can discuss the CT scan in more detail. It is a simple procedure, truly. Nurse, please. We require a blood draw, STAT.
PATIENT: Okay. Thank you, Doctor. I…I think I just need a minute to breathe. And maybe some water? Would that be alright? I just feel a little overwhelmed. And…nervous. Very nervous. .
