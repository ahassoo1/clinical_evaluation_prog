DOCTOR: Good morning, Nicoletta. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Lahn. It’s nice to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s very nice to meet you as well. Oh, my goodness, you’re a lovely woman. Well, to put it simply, I’m hoping you can help me feel… newer, I suppose. I’m 87 years old, you see, and while I don’t feel 87 all the time, things are starting to… slow down. I’m looking for a bit of a reset, a jumpstart to get my energy back, if you understand.
DOCTOR: I certainly do understand, Nicoletta. It's very common to experience changes in energy levels as we get older, and wanting to feel your best at any age is a wonderful goal. “Reset” and “jumpstart” – I like that! To get a better idea of what's going on, could you tell me a little more about what "slowing down" feels like for you?
PATIENT: Oh, well, let me see. It’s not… debilitating, not at all. It's more like… everything takes a bit longer. Getting up from a chair, for example. Or walking to the market – I used to love walking, just popping over, but now I need to rest halfway. And I used to have such a sharp mind, remembering names and faces, but that’s… a little harder these days. Not terrible, just… not like it was. And honestly, I just feel… tired, more often than I used to. It's a general slowing, you understand. Nothing specific, really.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand perfectly. That sounds frustrating, and it's good you're addressing it now. It sounds like a gradual decline in your usual energy levels and some changes in your physical abilities and memory. Let's try to get a clearer picture. When did you start noticing these changes?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s a good question. It didn't happen all at once, you see. Probably… hmm… I’d say maybe a year ago? Perhaps a little longer. It was subtle at first. Just needing a longer nap after gardening, things like that. Then, it slowly… added up. I didn’t really pay much attention at first, you know? Old age creeping in, I thought. But then my daughter, she noticed, and she insisted I come see someone. She worries, that one. A good girl, though. Very good.
DOCTOR: It's wonderful you have a daughter who looks out for you, Nicoletta. It’s very common for changes to happen gradually, and it’s good you’re seeking help now. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see… Well, years ago, when my husband was still alive, I had a touch of the arthritis in my hands. The doctor gave me some pills, and it helped a lot. I don't take anything for it now, though, it doesn’t bother me much unless it’s very cold. And I had my gallbladder out, goodness, must be… thirty years ago? More? It was a long time ago. Otherwise, nothing major, really. Just the usual aches and pains of getting older, I suppose. No serious illnesses, thank goodness.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful. And have you ever had any surgeries besides your gallbladder removed?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No, I don’t believe so. Just the gallbladder. My husband used to say I was too stubborn to let anyone operate on me unless absolutely necessary! He was a bit of a worrywart himself, though, always fussing about everything. He passed away… oh, goodness, ten years ago this November. A good man. But no, just the one surgery, as far as I recall.
DOCTOR: I’m sorry for your loss, Nicoletta. It sounds like you had a wonderful husband. Now, let’s talk about your family. Is there any history of medical conditions in your family, such as heart disease, diabetes, or memory problems?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, family history… that’s a tricky one. My mother, she lived to be 92, and she was very healthy, mostly. She did have a bit of trouble with her heart towards the end, I think. My father, he passed away when I was quite young, from… something with his lungs, I believe. He smoked, you see. Not a good habit. And my brother, he had… I think it was high blood pressure. He was a bit careless with his diet, always eating rich foods. As for memory problems… not that I recall, no. Everyone was pretty sharp-minded, for the most part.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful to know. Now, just to get a complete picture, could you tell me about any medications you’re currently taking, including any over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see… well, I take a little Vitamin D in the winter, the doctor said I wasn’t getting enough sunshine. And sometimes, if my arthritis flares up, I take some ibuprofen, just over-the-counter, you know? But that’s about it. I try to stay away from pills as much as possible. My daughter keeps trying to get me to take something for my cholesterol, but I haven't gotten around to it yet. I prefer a little papaya, if you understand. Keeps me regular, that does!
DOCTOR: Papaya is an excellent choice! I understand your preference for natural remedies. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, allergies… let me think. No, I don't think so. Nothing that I’m aware of. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything, thank goodness. I used to help my mother with her garden, and I was always touching flowers and plants, and I never had any trouble. I don’t have any skin allergies either. Just a little sensitive to the cold, sometimes, but that’s about it.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to know. Now, let's talk a little bit about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no! Never touched a cigarette in my life. My husband smoked for a bit when he was younger, but he quit when we got married. He said he didn’t want to risk my health. A good man, that one. I always thought smoking was a foolish habit. Too much money wasted, and it smells terrible! No, I’ve never smoked, and I don’t approve of it.
DOCTOR: That's excellent. And how about alcohol?
PATIENT: Oh, just a little glass of wine with dinner sometimes. Maybe on Sundays, if we had company. A small glass, mind you. My husband liked a little beer, but he didn’t drink much either. We weren’t big drinkers, never have been. Just a little something to relax with, on occasion. Nothing excessive, you understand. I’m more of a papaya woman, if you recall!
DOCTOR: Yes, I recall the papaya! That sounds very reasonable, Nicoletta. Now, could you tell me a little bit about your daily routine?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Well, I wake up around seven, usually. Have a little breakfast – papaya, if it’s in season! – and then I do a little light housework. I used to garden a lot more, but it’s getting harder these days. I read a lot, mostly Chamorro stories. My daughter brings me books from the library. And I try to take a walk, if the weather is nice. I go to church on Sundays, of course. And I see my grandchildren sometimes, they’re a handful, but I love them dearly. It’s a quiet life, mostly. Nothing exciting, but I enjoy it.
DOCTOR: That sounds lovely, Nicoletta. A peaceful and fulfilling life. Now, before we move on, is there anything else you think I should know about your health or your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. Oh! My sleep. It's… not as good as it used to be. I wake up a few times during the night, sometimes. Not every night, but often enough. I don't feel tired during the day, not usually, but I don't sleep as soundly as I once did. And I sometimes feel a little… down, just a little bit sad, thinking about my husband. It’s been ten years, you see. But it comes and goes. Nothing serious, just… a little bit of the blues sometimes. That’s probably all.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Nicoletta. It's completely normal to experience changes in sleep and occasional sadness, especially after a loss. It's good you're acknowledging those feelings. Now, let’s do a quick physical exam to get a better understanding of what’s going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. Just be gentle, if you would, please. My bones aren’t as strong as they used to be, you see. But I’m ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I’ll be as gentle as possible. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Could you please take a deep breath in… and out… Good. Now, let's check your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, but not drastically so. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart again… I hear a slight murmur, but it's not new. We’ll keep an eye on that. Now, let’s check your pulse… That’s good and steady. Now, I'd like to take a look in your ears and eyes… Everything looks normal there. Finally, I’d like to feel your abdomen and check your reflexes… Your abdomen is soft, and your reflexes are a little diminished, which is common at your age. Everything seems to be within normal limits for someone your age. Alright, everything seems to be relatively stable, Nicoletta. However, I do want to order some blood work to get a clearer picture of what’s going on. This will help us rule out any underlying conditions. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, that sounds sensible, Doctor. Blood work, yes. If that’s what you think is best. I trust your judgment. Anything to help me feel a little… newer, you know? I’m happy to do whatever you recommend. Just tell me where to go and what to do, and I’ll do it.
DOCTOR: Wonderful, Nicoletta. I’ll write you a requisition for a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, a thyroid stimulating hormone test, and a Vitamin D level. The lab is just down the hall, and they're expecting you. You don’t need to fast for this test, but please let them know you're taking a small amount of Vitamin D. While we're waiting for the results, I recommend focusing on some simple lifestyle changes. Continue with the papaya, of course! And aim for at least 30 minutes of gentle exercise most days of the week, like walking. Also, try to establish a regular sleep schedule and make sure your bedroom is dark, quiet, and cool. In the meantime, if you experience any new symptoms or if your current symptoms worsen, please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic. Do you have any questions for me right now, Nicoletta?
PATIENT: Oh, that all sounds very reasonable, Doctor. Gentle exercise and regular sleep… I can certainly try. Thirty minutes of walking… that might be a bit of a challenge, but I’ll do my best. Hmm… let me see… Yes, actually, I do have a question. I’ve been hearing a lot about these… supplements. Are any of those helpful for feeling more energetic? My daughter keeps trying to get me to take something called… CoQ10, I think it was? Is that something I should consider?
DOCTOR: That’s a very good question, Nicoletta. Many people ask about supplements. CoQ10, or Coenzyme Q10, is an antioxidant that’s often recommended for energy support. There is some evidence that it can be helpful for certain conditions, like heart failure, and some people report feeling more energetic when they take it. However, the research is still mixed, and it's not a guaranteed solution. More importantly, supplements aren’t regulated as strictly as medications, so the quality and dosage can vary. And some supplements can interact with medications you’re taking, even over-the-counter ones. Since you’re currently taking a small amount of Vitamin D, and we're waiting for your blood work results, I recommend holding off on any new supplements for now. Once we have your results, we can discuss whether CoQ10 or any other supplements might be appropriate for you specifically. It's always best to talk to your doctor before starting any new supplement, even if it seems harmless. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Doctor. Quality control and potential interactions… I hadn’t thought about that. My daughter doesn’t always explain things very thoroughly. Waiting for the blood work results is the sensible thing to do, I suppose. I appreciate you explaining it so clearly. Hmm… I think that’s all my questions for now. Thank you so much for your time and your patience, Doctor. You’ve put my mind at ease. I’ll go and get the blood work done, and I’ll look forward to hearing from you.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Nicoletta. I’m glad I could help. Please don't hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. We'll call you as soon as your blood work results are available, usually within a few days. It was a pleasure meeting you. Have a lovely day, and remember to take it easy!
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You as well. And yes, I shall try to take it easy!
