DOCTOR: Hi Amy, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Roseburrough. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you as well. Well, I’ve been feeling a bit concerned about a lump I’ve noticed in my lower abdomen. It’s been there for a few weeks now, and I thought it best to get it checked out.
DOCTOR: Okay, a lump in your lower abdomen for a few weeks. That’s good you’re getting it checked out. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Certainly. It’s… hard to describe. It’s not particularly painful, just… present. It feels firm, but not rock-hard, if that makes sense. It doesn’t seem to be getting bigger noticeably, but I haven’t been actively measuring it or anything. I mostly notice it when I’m lying down, or if I press on that area.
DOCTOR: Okay, firm but not rock-hard, you notice it more when lying down or with pressure. And no significant change in size over the few weeks you've noticed it. Does it feel like it's right on the skin, or deeper inside?
PATIENT: Hmm, that’s a good question. I’d say it feels… a little deeper than right on the skin. Not deep deep, but not something I could easily poke at through my skin, you know? It’s almost like it’s just under the muscle layer.
DOCTOR: Okay, just under the muscle layer. And you said it's not painful?
PATIENT: Not at all painful, no. Sometimes, if I’ve been doing a lot of physical activity – I’m a choreographer, so I’m quite active – I feel a slight discomfort when I press on it, but it’s not like a sharp pain or anything worrying. More like a… dull ache, briefly.
DOCTOR: Okay, dull ache with pressure after physical activity. Good to know. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms along with this lump?
PATIENT: No, not really. No fever, no weight loss, no changes in my bowel habits… everything else feels pretty normal, to be honest. That’s why I wasn’t immediately panicked, but I figured it was best to have a doctor take a look.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s helpful. Let’s do a quick physical exam. I’m going to gently palpate your abdomen, just to get a better feel for the lump and the surrounding area. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s perfectly fine. Please, go ahead. I trust your judgement, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Okay, I’m feeling the area now. It's approximately 3cm in diameter, slightly irregular in shape, and feels firm, as you described. It doesn't move much when I press on it – somewhat fixed. There is minimal tenderness to palpation. No rebound tenderness or guarding. I don't feel any other masses nearby. Okay, that gives me a little more information. Now, can you tell me about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Certainly. I’m generally quite healthy. I haven’t had any major illnesses or surgeries. I had the usual childhood vaccinations, and I get a yearly flu shot. My family doctor is Dr. Khalil, back in… well, he practices in Jericho. I haven’t seen him in a couple of years, to be honest, since moving here. I am covered by Medicare. My wife, Layla, and I are both relatively healthy. She has some mild allergies, but nothing serious. I don’t smoke and I rarely drink alcohol.
DOCTOR: Okay, good health overall, up-to-date on vaccinations, no significant medical history. No surgeries?
PATIENT: No surgeries at all, Doctor. Not even as a child. Just the usual bumps and bruises from… well, being a choreographer, again! It’s a physically demanding job, but I enjoy it. I've never needed anything more than a bandage, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. And you mentioned your wife has some mild allergies?
PATIENT: Yes, just seasonal allergies, mostly. Pollen, dust… things like that. She manages them with over-the-counter antihistamines. Nothing life-threatening or that requires a doctor’s visit regularly. She’s very careful about avoiding triggers.
DOCTOR: Okay, seasonal allergies managed with OTC medication. Now, have you ever had any issues with hernias?
PATIENT: Hmm… a hernia? I don’t think so. I’m not sure I even know what to look for, to be honest. I’ve never been told I have one, and I’ve never experienced any pain in my groin or noticed any bulging. Is that what one feels like? I mostly work with core muscles, so I'd think I'd notice something like that.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. Sometimes a hernia can present as a lump, so I just wanted to rule that out. Let’s talk a little bit about your bowel habits. Have you noticed any changes in your frequency, consistency, or color of your stools recently?
PATIENT: No changes at all, Doctor. Everything is… regular, as you say. No constipation, no diarrhea, no blood in my stool… nothing out of the ordinary. It’s been consistent for as long as I can remember. I eat a fairly balanced diet, lots of fruits and vegetables. Nothing dramatic has changed in my routine or diet.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good. Now, just to be thorough, have you had any recent weight loss that you haven't been trying for?
PATIENT: No, no weight loss at all. In fact, I think I might have gained a little weight recently, if anything! Layla keeps telling me I need to watch my portions. But nothing significant, just a few pounds. Definitely not intentional weight loss.
DOCTOR: Okay, no unintentional weight loss. Alright, Amy, based on what you've told me and the physical exam, it’s difficult to say definitively what this lump is without further investigation. It could be a number of things – a lipoma, a muscle knot, or something else entirely. I want to be cautious and rule out anything serious. I'm going to order an abdominal ultrasound to get a better look at the lump and the surrounding tissues. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly reasonable, Doctor. I appreciate you being thorough. An ultrasound sounds like a good idea. I’m happy to do whatever it takes to get to the bottom of this. Where would I go to get that done?
DOCTOR: Okay, great. I’m going to give you a referral to the imaging center at St. Jude’s Hospital. They have a good reputation and I’ve had good results with them. Here’s the referral form and the contact information. They will likely schedule you for the ultrasound within the next few days. After the ultrasound, the radiologist will send the results to me, and I'll contact you to discuss them and plan any further steps. Do you have any questions about that process?
PATIENT: No, that sounds very clear, Doctor. Thank you. St. Jude's Hospital, I’ll call them tomorrow. And they’ll send the results directly to you. Is there anything I should do to prepare for the ultrasound? Do I need to fast or anything like that? I don't want to mess up the results by not being prepared.
DOCTOR: That’s a good question. For an abdominal ultrasound, you should drink plenty of water for a couple of days beforehand to keep your bladder full. A full bladder helps get a clearer image. You don’t need to fast, but avoid eating a heavy meal right before the appointment. Otherwise, just come as you are. I'll also send a note with these instructions to the imaging center to remind them. Do you have any other questions for me before we finish up?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything, Doctor. You’ve been very helpful and thorough, and I appreciate you taking the time to listen to my concerns. I’ll call St. Jude’s tomorrow and schedule the ultrasound. Thank you again for everything.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Amy. I’m glad I could help. Don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your appointment. We'll get to the bottom of this. Have a good day.
