DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kristofik. I'm Dr. Sham. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Look, Doc, I don’t really have time for a lot of chit-chat. My gut’s been… puffed up. Bloated. It’s uncomfortable, alright? Just want to know what’s causing it and how to fix it. I got things to do.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. Bloated gut, uncomfortable. I understand you're short on time. Let’s try to be efficient. When did this bloating start, roughly?
PATIENT: Roughly? Honestly, I don't keep track of that stuff. A few weeks, maybe? It comes and goes. It’s not like it’s constant. Look, is it serious? That’s what I need to know. I don't do well with… complications. My wife… well, never mind. Just tell me if I need a scan or something.
DOCTOR: Okay. A few weeks, intermittent. We need to rule out anything serious, of course. Can you describe the bloating a bit more?
PATIENT: Describe it? It feels… full. Like I ate a Thanksgiving dinner and then another one. Just… tight. And sometimes gassy. Look, I'm a pile driver operator, okay? I don’t have time to analyze my gut feelings. Is this something I can take a pill for, or what? Because if it's not, I really need to get back to work.
DOCTOR: Alright, “tight and gassy,” intermittent. Let's go through some basics to help narrow things down. Have you noticed any changes in your bowel movements – diarrhea, constipation, anything like that?
PATIENT: Look, you want me to talk about… that? Seriously? I’m a grown man. I go to the bathroom when I need to, alright? It's… normal. Most of the time. Sometimes a little harder, sometimes a little looser. It varies. Is that what you need to know? Because frankly, this is getting ridiculous. I feel like I’m back in grade school.
DOCTOR: Mr. Kristofik, I understand your frustration. These questions are important. Changes in bowel habits can point to the cause. So, "sometimes harder, sometimes looser," okay. And have you noticed any blood in your stool?
PATIENT: Blood? No. Look, I’d notice blood, alright? I'm not completely oblivious. I told you, I just want to know what's causing the bloating. Is it something I ate? Stress? I've been working long hours. Is that it? Just tell me something useful. This is wasting my time. And frankly, it’s a little insulting.
DOCTOR: Okay, no blood. Long hours... I see you're a pile driver operator. That’s physically demanding work. Have you experienced any nausea, vomiting, or weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Nausea? No. Vomiting? Definitely not. Weight loss? Maybe a little… I haven't really been eating much, to be honest. Been too busy. And stressed. But that's not weight loss, it's just… not eating as much. Look, is this going anywhere? Are you going to tell me what’s wrong, or are we just going to keep playing twenty questions? I got a job to do.
DOCTOR: Alright. No nausea, no vomiting, possible slight weight loss, intermittent bloating, changes in bowel habits, long work hours. Let's do a quick physical exam. Just need to listen to your abdomen and feel for anything unusual. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Get it over with. But don’t expect me to sit here all day. Just… quick, alright? I got things to do. And don’t tell me anything I don't need to know. Keep it simple.
DOCTOR: Alright. Lie back on the exam table, please. I’m just going to listen to your stomach sounds, and then gently press on your abdomen. Just let me know if anything feels particularly tender. Sounds are… normal, active. Now, I’m going to press gently here… Any pain when I press here?
PATIENT: Ugh. Okay, that’s… a little uncomfortable. Not pain, just… feels full. Like you said. Right… around here. A little bit tender. But I mean, I just told you I'm bloated, alright? It's going to be tender. What does that even mean?
DOCTOR: Tenderness in the lower abdomen. Okay. No guarding or rebound tenderness, which is good. Alright. Based on what you've told me and the quick exam, it could be a number of things – gas, indigestion, possibly some mild constipation. But to be certain, I'd like to order a stool sample to rule out anything more serious. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: A stool sample?! Seriously? You want me to… collect my… waste? Look, I'm a grown man. I don’t have time for this. Is that really necessary? Can't you just give me something for the bloating? Something to settle my stomach? I swear, this is the worst doctor's visit I’ve ever had. Just… is there a pill? Anything? I don’t want to mess around with samples. It's… degrading. .
DOCTOR: Mr. Kristofik, I understand your discomfort. The stool sample is just a precaution. But alright. We can try some over-the-counter remedies for gas and bloating first. I recommend simethicone or activated charcoal. And try to avoid foods that trigger gas – beans, broccoli, carbonated drinks. If it doesn’t improve within a week, or if you develop fever, severe abdominal pain, or changes in bowel habits, please come back and we'll do further testing. Does that sound acceptable?
