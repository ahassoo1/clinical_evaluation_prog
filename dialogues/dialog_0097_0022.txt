DOCTOR: Good morning, Soila. It's lovely to meet you. I'm Dr. Georgiou. Why don't you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It's nice to meet you too. Hmm… what brings me in… well, my tummy feels… puffy, you know? Like it’s full of air, even when I haven't eaten much. And I don’t feel like eating, not like I used to. Everything just… sits. I don't know. It's been a little while now.
DOCTOR: Okay, “puffy” and not feeling hungry, with food just sitting… and you said this has been going on for a little while. Can you tell me roughly how long “a little while” is?
PATIENT: Oh dear… time… it goes so fast, doesn't it? Let me think… maybe… a month? Or two? It’s hard to say exactly. I used to be very good with dates, when I was studying… sociology, you know? But now… they all blur together. It just slowly started, I think. Not a sudden thing.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, don’t worry about pinpointing the exact date. A month or two is helpful. And it started gradually… Okay. Besides the puffiness and not feeling hungry, have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Changes… hmm. Well, I think I'm going to the bathroom less often. But maybe that’s just because I'm not eating as much? It's hard to tell. And… sometimes I feel a little tired. But I'm ninety years old! Being tired is normal, right?
DOCTOR: You are absolutely right, being a little tired at ninety is very normal! But it’s good to mention everything. Less frequent bathroom visits… and the puffiness and decreased appetite… Okay. Have you noticed any pain anywhere?
PATIENT: Pain… no, not really. Not sharp pain, anyway. Sometimes my tummy feels… uncomfortable. Like it’s full, even when it isn’t. And maybe a little… heavy? But not pain, no. It’s more of a… a feeling.
DOCTOR: Okay, “uncomfortable” and “heavy” rather than pain. And no changes in your bowel movements other than frequency?
PATIENT: Bowel… oh, you mean… going to the bathroom? No, everything looks normal. Just… less of it. Sorry, is that too much information? I always worried about being too… detailed.
DOCTOR: Not at all, Soila, it’s important to be detailed! That helps me understand what's going on. Less frequent and less volume is good to know. Now, have you noticed any nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea at all?
PATIENT: Oh, no, none of those. No throwing up, no… what did you say? Diarrhea? No, thankfully not. Just… less everything, you know? And the puffy tummy. It’s a little embarrassing, really. I used to be so… trim.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's perfectly alright to feel that way. Okay, no nausea, no vomiting, no diarrhea… just the puffiness, decreased appetite, and less frequent bowel movements. Now, let's talk a little about your medical history. Do you have any health problems that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Oh dear… medical history… that was a long time ago. I had a bad flu when I was young, very bad. And… something with my blood pressure, I think. The doctor gave me pills for it, for a long time. But I don’t take them anymore. I forget why, exactly. And… I think I broke my arm once, when I was a child. Is that important?
DOCTOR: It’s helpful to know all of it, Soila. The flu, the blood pressure pills, and the broken arm… we can definitely look into the blood pressure history. Do you remember what the doctor told you about the blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh… no, not really. Something about it being… high? And dangerous? I just remember taking the little pills every day. For a very long time. Then the doctor… changed, I think. And I just… stopped taking them. It seemed right at the time.
DOCTOR: Okay, high blood pressure in the past, treated with pills, and then discontinued… We’ll want to check your blood pressure today. Now, have you had any surgeries at all?
PATIENT: Surgeries… hmm. Let me think… I had my tonsils out when I was a little girl. That's all I can remember. It was very scary, but I recovered quickly. And… I think my mother told me I had stitches once, when I fell and cut my knee, but that was a very long time ago. Is that all you need to know?
DOCTOR: Okay, tonsils out as a child and stitches for a knee injury. Good to know. Now, let's talk about your family. Are there any medical problems that run in your family?
PATIENT: Oh, family… my mother… she lived a long time, but she had… arthritis, I think. Very painful, she said. And my father… he had a bad heart, I remember. He died when I was young. And… my brother had something with his eyes, but I don't remember exactly what. We didn't talk much about health, back then.
DOCTOR: Okay, arthritis in your mother, heart problems in your father, and something with your brother’s eyes. That's helpful. Now, a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: Oh, no, never. I never liked smoking. My mother didn't smoke, and my father didn't either. It just… didn't appeal to me. I always preferred fresh air.
DOCTOR: Okay, never smoked. And how about alcohol?
PATIENT: Oh, just a little wine sometimes. With dinner. Nothing much. I don’t drink very often anymore. I used to enjoy a glass with my friends, but… most of my friends are gone now.
DOCTOR: Okay, just a little wine occasionally. Now, are you currently taking any medications at all, even over-the-counter ones?
PATIENT: No, not right now. Like I said, I stopped taking the blood pressure pills a long time ago. And… I don't really take anything else. I try to stay healthy, you know? I eat what I can, and I walk a little when the weather is nice.
DOCTOR: Okay, no current medications. And finally, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh… allergies… hmm. I don’t think so. I used to get a little itchy sometimes when I was a child, but I don't remember what it was from. Nothing serious, though. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything, as far as I know.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Thank you, Soila. That was very helpful. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, and feel your abdomen to see if we can figure out what’s going on with the puffiness. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. My tummy does feel strange. Maybe listening will help. Just be gentle, alright? It’s a little sensitive.
DOCTOR: Certainly, I will be very gentle. First, let's listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, but a little bit rapid. Lungs are clear. Now, I’m going to gently feel your abdomen. I’m noticing a little tenderness when I press here, and it feels a bit full. No masses or hard spots. It doesn’t seem to be causing you sharp pain, just discomfort?
PATIENT: No, not sharp pain. Just… uncomfortable. Like something is… pressing on me. And full, even when I haven’t eaten much. It’s a strange feeling. That spot feels a little… swollen, I think. But maybe I’m just imagining it.
DOCTOR: No, it’s good you told me. I feel a little fullness there as well. Given your symptoms – the puffiness, decreased appetite, less frequent bowel movements, and the tenderness I feel – and your history, a few things come to mind. It could be something as simple as constipation, or it could be something else. I’d like to order a few blood tests to get a better picture of what’s going on. We'll check your complete blood count, electrolytes, kidney function, and liver function. And I'd like to do a stool test to rule out any infection. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Blood tests and… a stool test? Oh dear. That sounds… complicated. But… if it will help, then yes. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just want to feel better. And… what does “electrolytes” mean?
DOCTOR: It’s alright, it does sound complicated, but we'll take it one step at a time. “Electrolytes” are just salts in your body, like sodium and potassium. They help your body function properly. The blood tests and stool test will help us rule out a lot of different things. We'll check for things like infection, anemia, and any imbalances in your body. The lab is just down the hall, and the nurse will draw the blood for you. The stool test… well, they'll give you a container and instructions. It's not pleasant, but it’s important. Once we have the results, we can discuss them and figure out the best course of action. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Okay… salts… and… a container. It all sounds a bit scary, but I trust you, Doctor. You seem very nice. Yes, I’ll do the tests. Just… tell me if anything will hurt, alright? And… how long will it take to get the results?
DOCTOR: That’s very kind of you to say, Soila. And absolutely, I’ll explain everything before we do it, and I'll make sure you're comfortable. The blood draw might sting for a moment, but it’s very quick. And the stool test… well, it's just collecting a sample. The results usually take about three to five business days to come back. Once we have them, we’ll schedule another appointment to discuss them in detail. In the meantime, if you experience any severe pain, fever, nausea, vomiting, or significant changes in your bowel movements, please don't hesitate to call the office or go to the nearest emergency room. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good. Three to five days… I can wait. And I’ll remember about the emergency room. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very patient with me. I think… I think I’m ready for the tests now.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Soila. It’s my pleasure. And you’re a very good patient; you’ve answered all my questions thoughtfully, and that helps a lot. Alright, let me call the nurse, and she'll come in and draw your blood. Then she’ll explain how to collect the stool sample. Do you need help getting up?
PATIENT: No, thank you, I can manage. I used to be very strong, you know. Just… a little slow. Thank you again, Doctor. I appreciate your help. I’ll see you in a few days.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Soila. Take your time. I'll see you in a few days. And don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before then.
PATIENT: .
