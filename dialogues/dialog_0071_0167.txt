DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Stoegbauer. I’m Dr. Galena. It’s… good to meet you. Now, I see you’re here today… could you tell me a bit about what brought you in?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. Yes, well… my foot. It’s been… troublesome. A sore, you see. A very painful sore. It won’t seem to get better, no matter what I do.
DOCTOR: A sore on your foot… alright. And how long has this sore been… troublesome, as you say?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. A while now. Maybe… three, four months? It started small, like a little cut, and I didn't think much of it. But it just… grew. And now, it really hurts to walk. I try to wear slippers all the time, but still.
DOCTOR: Three or four months… okay. And where exactly on your foot is this sore located?
PATIENT: It’s on the bottom of my foot, Doctor. Right near my big toe. It’s… hard to see, I suppose, because of where it is. I have to… look with a mirror. And it's not a nice sight, let me tell you. Red, and… deep.
DOCTOR: Alright, near your big toe… red and deep, you say. We’ll certainly take a look. Would you mind if I had a quick examination?
PATIENT: No, no, not at all, Doctor. Please do. I just want it to feel better. It makes everything so difficult. I used to like to garden, but… not anymore.
DOCTOR: Alright, if you could just have a seat there, and I’ll take a look. I’ll need to expose the foot, of course. We'll want to get a good look. Hmm… yes, I see it. It is quite inflamed. And it does appear deep… There’s a bit of drainage, too. Does that hurt when I press here?
PATIENT: Ouch! Yes, Doctor, that does hurt. Quite a bit, actually. It feels… tender all around it, not just right on the sore. It’s like it’s… irritated underneath, you know? Not just the surface. Is it bad?
DOCTOR: It’s… concerning, yes. It could be a number of things. An infected blister, a more serious skin infection, or… we need to rule out other possibilities. It's difficult to say definitively without further investigation. Do you have any fever, or chills?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, no fever. Not that I know of. And no chills either. I feel… tired, maybe. But I'm an old man, so that's not unusual. But the foot… it’s just really sore and I'm worried.
DOCTOR: Alright, no fever or chills. Just the soreness and tiredness. Do you have any diabetes, Mr. Stoegbauer?
PATIENT: Oh… yes. Yes, I do. The doctor told me… many years ago. I try to watch my sugar, but sometimes… it’s hard. I like my fruit, you see.
DOCTOR: Alright, diabetes. That’s important to know. Diabetes can sometimes cause problems with healing, and increase the risk of infection. We’ll need to be extra careful. I'm going to recommend we get some tests done. A blood test to check your sugar levels and look for signs of infection, and… I think we should get an X-ray of your foot to see if there's anything going on with the bone. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds… wise. Whatever you think is best. I just want this to be fixed. I don't like being stuck inside all the time. X-ray… and the blood test. Whatever it takes. Can you… tell me what the blood test is for exactly? I don't understand much of this medical talk.
DOCTOR: Of course, of course. The blood test will help us see how well your diabetes is controlled, and if there are any signs of infection in your body. We'll also look at your white blood cell count - that's a sign that your body is fighting something off. It's a pretty standard test, shouldn’t take long. I'll write the orders for those now. And then, we'll get you over to radiology for the X-ray. I'll also have the nurse take a look at this wound and start some basic wound care for now. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds very good, Doctor. Thank you. I appreciate you explaining things. And the nurse… that's good too. Anything to help it feel better. Wound care… yes. Please.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I’ll get the nurse in right away. And then we’ll get those tests ordered. I’ll be back to discuss the results as soon as they are available. In the meantime, try to keep weight off of your foot as much as possible. And if you notice any increased redness, swelling, or pus, please call the clinic immediately. Alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, I will. No weight on it… and watch for redness and pus. I understand. Thank you again for your help. I just hope it's not too serious.
DOCTOR: We’ll get to the bottom of it, Mr. Stoegbauer. Don't worry. I'll let the nurse know you're ready, and she'll come in shortly. .
