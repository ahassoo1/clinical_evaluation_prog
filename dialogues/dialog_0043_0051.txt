DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Nini. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Kalinski. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Kalinski, is it? A lovely name. Let me see… what did bring me in… Ah, yes! It's about my blood. My… well, someone said I should find out what kind it is. For… reasons. It’s a bit fuzzy, honestly. It’s just… important to know, I think. I don't recall exactly why though.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Nini. Knowing your blood type is often useful information. It's good you're being proactive. Just to clarify, are you experiencing any symptoms currently that prompted this request, or is this purely for informational purposes?
PATIENT: Oh, symptoms? No, no, nothing like that, dear. I feel… well, I’m seventy-nine, you know. Things ache a bit now and then, but that’s just… being seventy-nine! No, it wasn’t anything sudden. Just… a suggestion. A friend, maybe? Or the nurse at the… the place. It’s all a bit muddled, I’m afraid.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Nini. It’s common for details to become less clear over time. So, to be sure I understand correctly, you were advised by someone – perhaps a friend or a healthcare professional – to determine your blood type, but you aren't experiencing any specific health concerns at this time?
PATIENT: That sounds about right, yes. Exactly. No worries or anything, just… doing what I was told. It’s good to be prepared, isn’t it? Though prepared for what, I couldn’t rightly say. It's probably something silly. I used to work with… ropes, you know. Big ropes. Maybe it has something to do with that?
DOCTOR: That’s a good point, Ms. Nini. Being prepared is always wise. And it’s good you mentioned the ropes – sometimes seemingly unrelated details can be helpful. Just out of curiosity, what sort of work did you do with ropes?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Rigging, dear. I was a rigger. On ships, mostly. And… well, wherever they needed things lifted. Big things. It was a long time ago, of course. Before… everything. Lots of climbing, lots of knots. Very strong arms, I used to have. Not so much now, though. It's funny what you remember, isn't it?
DOCTOR: It certainly is, Ms. Nini. Rigging is quite a demanding profession, requiring a great deal of strength and precision. Thank you for sharing that with me. Now, to get back to the reason for your visit, determining your blood type is a relatively simple procedure. It involves a small blood draw, and the results will provide us with valuable information. Before we proceed, do you have any known allergies, particularly to latex or alcohol swabs?
PATIENT: Allergies… let me think. Not that I know of. I used to get stung by bees sometimes, when I was a girl, but that wasn't an allergy, just… unpleasant. Latex… I don’t think so. Alcohol… well, I enjoy a little sherry now and then, does that count? No, honestly, I don’t believe I’m allergic to anything. Unless… maybe bad moods. Those give me a headache.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, Ms. Nini. And I completely agree – bad moods can certainly be detrimental! So, no known latex or medication allergies. Excellent. And just to be thorough, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. That’s a tricky one. Let me see… I take a little something for my… what do you call it? The water retention. Makes my ankles swell, you know. A small white pill. And sometimes, when my joints ache, I take… ibuprofen, I think it is. The orange one. And… oh! A vitamin D, the doctor told me to, because I don't get much sun. That's about it, I believe. Nothing fancy.
DOCTOR: Alright, so we have a medication for water retention, ibuprofen for joint pain as needed, and vitamin D. Do you happen to know the dosage of the medication for water retention?
PATIENT: Dosage… oh, goodness. That's a question. It's a little white pill, and I take… one? Or maybe two? Every day, I think. It came in a small orange bottle. The label… well, it's faded, I'm afraid. My eyesight isn't what it used to be. I just take it with my breakfast. The nurse… she usually reminds me.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Ms. Nini. We can certainly clarify that. I’m going to take a quick look at your chart to see if we have a record of your medications. One moment, please. Okay, I see here a prescription for Furosemide 20mg once daily. Is that the medication you were referring to?
PATIENT: Furosemide… yes! That sounds right. That’s it! Twenty milligrams… yes. You are a clever doctor! I couldn’t have told you that name if my life depended on it. It helps with my ankles, you see. They get so puffy.
DOCTOR: That's good to know, Ms. Nini. And it’s perfectly alright to not remember medication names; that's what we’re here for. Now that we’ve clarified your medications, would you mind if I perform a brief physical exam – just to check your vital signs and listen to your heart and lungs?
PATIENT: Oh, no trouble at all, dear. A physical exam? Certainly. Whatever you need. I haven't had one in… well, a long time. But if you think it's best… go right ahead. I'm a very easy patient, I promise.
DOCTOR: Wonderful. If you could just have a seat here, we’ll get started. Your blood pressure is 138/82, your pulse is 72 and regular, and your temperature is 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit. That’s within a reasonable range. Now, I’m just going to listen to your heart and lungs with my stethoscope. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear, but I do hear some mild crackles at the bases of both lungs. That can sometimes be due to fluid buildup, which is consistent with the Furosemide. We’ll keep an eye on that. Now, I'm going to gently palpate your abdomen. Do you experience any abdominal pain or discomfort?
PATIENT: Abdominal pain? Not really. Sometimes a little… gurgly, perhaps. But nothing to worry about. I eat a bit too much sherry sometimes, I suspect. It settles down eventually. Just a bit of… old age, I think. You can poke around as much as you like, dear. I’m not a delicate flower, you know.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear, Ms. Nini. Your abdomen feels soft and there's no tenderness. And I appreciate your good humor. Now, I'm going to check your extremities for any swelling or signs of decreased circulation. As we discussed, there is some mild swelling in your ankles. This is likely related to the Furosemide as well. We will monitor that closely. Finally, I'll check your reflexes. Your reflexes are normal and symmetrical. Okay, that completes the physical exam. Based on my findings, everything appears stable, but we will want to continue monitoring your fluid balance and addressing the swelling in your ankles. Now, to determine your blood type, we’ll just need a small sample of blood. Are you comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, perfectly comfortable. A little prick, right? I’ve had worse. When I was a rigger, I had a few scrapes and bruises, I assure you. Go ahead, dear. The sooner we know, the better. I’m ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Just a small prick, as you said. It will only take a moment. Okay, all done. Just keep gentle pressure on this for a few minutes to prevent any bruising. We'll send this sample to the lab, and we should have the results back within a few hours. While we're waiting, do you have any questions or concerns that I can address?
PATIENT: No, I think you’ve covered everything, dear. You've been very thorough. A little prick, and now we wait. That’s alright. I'm not in a hurry. Perhaps I'll just sit here and… think about ropes for a bit. Thank you, Doctor. You've put my mind at ease.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Nini. I’m glad I could help. I’ll be back shortly with the lab results as soon as they’re available. In the meantime, please feel free to relax. If you need anything at all, don't hesitate to let the nurse know.
