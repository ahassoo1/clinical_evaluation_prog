DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kristofik. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Romario Chagaris. It’s good to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Look, I don’t really have time for pleasantries. It’s…my stomach, I guess. It’s been bloated. Really uncomfortable. Can we just get this over with?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Kristofik. I appreciate you being direct. We can absolutely focus on getting to the bottom of your stomach discomfort. “Bloated” is a good starting point. Can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Ugh, like…full of air. It’s hard to explain. It just…puffs up. Mostly in the evenings, I think. After I eat. Not always, though. Honestly, I don’t pay that much attention. It’s just annoying. Is that all you need to know? Because, seriously, I got things to do.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds quite bothersome, even if it's intermittent. “Mostly in the evenings after you eat” is helpful. To get a clearer picture, could you describe what you typically eat in the evenings?
PATIENT: What do I eat? Whatever’s easiest, alright? Leftovers, usually. Sometimes I’ll grill something if I’m feeling up to it. It’s not like it matters. I eat normal food. Look, is this gonna take long? I really don’t remember what I had last night. Probably…chicken? Or beef. Something like that. It all blends together. My wife used to handle the meals, you know. It’s… different now.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Kristofik. It sounds like you’ve been dealing with a lot of changes. It’s alright if you don't recall specifics about last night's meal. Even a general idea helps. You mentioned leftovers and sometimes grilling. Do you notice any particular foods seem to make the bloating worse than others, even if it’s not consistent?
PATIENT: No. Not really. Look, I’m a pile driver operator, alright? I work hard. I eat when I can. I don’t sit around analyzing my dinner. It’s food. It fuels me. I honestly don't have time for this. Is there a pill you can give me or something? Just…something to make it stop? I’m not a fussy eater.
DOCTOR: I appreciate your honesty, Mr. Kristofik. It sounds like you lead a very active life, and I respect that. Before we consider any medications, which we certainly can discuss, I'd like to ask a few more questions to ensure we’re addressing the right issue and ruling out anything serious. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Fine. But keep it quick. I got a job site waiting. What kind of questions? As long as they don’t involve me listing every single thing I’ve ever eaten, I guess. Honestly, I’m starting to feel…stressed just talking about this. Is that even related to the bloating? Look, it's probably just gas. Can we just assume it’s gas?
DOCTOR: It's perfectly reasonable to wonder if it’s simply gas, Mr. Kristofik. And yes, stress can absolutely contribute to digestive issues, including bloating. We will try and figure out the root cause. Let’s start with something simple. Aside from the bloating, have you experienced any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Like…what kind of symptoms? I feel tired, obviously. I do hard labor. That’s normal. My stomach…sometimes it gurgles. And…I guess it feels a little crampy sometimes, yeah. Especially after I eat, like we said. Is that what you mean? I’m not a doctor, alright? I don’t know all the medical terms. Just… uncomfortable. Mostly uncomfortable. Can we just skip the symptom listing and get to a solution?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Kristofik. “Gurgling and cramping after eating” is helpful information. To clarify, are those cramps localized to a specific area of your abdomen, or are they more generalized?
PATIENT: Ugh. Generalized. Everywhere, I guess. Lower stomach, mostly. It’s hard to pinpoint. Look, it's not like I'm dying here. It's just…annoying. I’m a grown man, alright? I’ve had worse pains on the job site. Honestly, I feel like I’m wasting my time here. Is there anything I can take over the counter? Something for gas and bloating? I really need to get going. .
DOCTOR: I understand your desire for a quick solution, Mr. Kristofik. While over-the-counter medications like simethicone or activated charcoal may provide some temporary relief from gas and bloating, it's important to rule out other potential causes, even if it seems unlikely. Given the generalized cramping and the fact that this has been ongoing, I’d like to do a brief physical examination of your abdomen. Would that be alright?
