DOCTOR: Hi Kiante, welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. DeCosta. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Hi Dr. DeCosta, nice to meet you too. I need a letter confirming I'm able to fly. It’s… complicated, but my travel insurance requires it. It's for a trip I’m planning, and they’re being very strict this year.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. A letter for travel insurance, confirming your fitness to fly. That's perfectly reasonable. To write that letter for you, I’ll need to gather a little information first, just to be thorough. I see here you’re 33 years old. Do you have any current medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No, not really. I was widowed a few years ago, and my husband… well, that was sudden. Aside from grief, I'm generally healthy. I have Medicare, and I’ve had my regular check-ups. Nothing major flagged, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: I'm very sorry to hear about your husband. That must have been incredibly difficult. It's good to know you’ve been keeping up with your regular check-ups. "Nothing major flagged" is helpful, but just to be complete, could you tell me about any past surgeries or hospitalizations you’ve had?
PATIENT: No surgeries, thankfully. I did spend a couple of nights in the hospital when I was a teenager with a bad case of pneumonia, but that was… a long time ago. Fully recovered. Otherwise, just the usual childhood illnesses, I think. Nothing serious enough to require anything beyond a doctor’s visit.
DOCTOR: Okay, no surgeries, pneumonia as a teenager, and generally healthy otherwise. That's good to know. And how about your family?
PATIENT: My immediate family… it’s just my mother, really. She’s healthy too, living back in Mongolia. My father passed away when I was young. No significant health issues on either side that I'm aware of. I mean, everyone gets the usual aches and pains as they get older, but nothing hereditary that would be relevant, I don't think.
DOCTOR: Alright. And just to get a full picture, could you tell me about any medications you’re currently taking, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Nothing at all, actually. No prescriptions, no vitamins, no regular pain relievers. I really try to stay away from taking anything unless absolutely necessary. I drink a lot of tea, if that counts! But it's just herbal tea, nothing medicinal.
DOCTOR: Okay, no medications at all – that's good to know. Now, let's talk a little bit about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no. Not at all. I don’t smoke, I rarely drink – maybe a glass of wine with dinner on a special occasion, but that’s it. And definitely no recreational drugs. I prefer a quiet life. Mostly reading and… planning trips, apparently.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s very helpful. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope, no allergies that I know of. I’ve always been pretty lucky in that regard. No reactions to anything. I've eaten all sorts of things during my travels and never had a problem. I don't wear any jewelry, so no metal allergies either.
DOCTOR: Okay, excellent. So, just to summarize, you’re 33 years old, generally healthy, no past surgeries or hospitalizations aside from pneumonia as a teenager, healthy family history, no medications or allergies, and don’t smoke, drink, or use recreational drugs. Is that a fair assessment?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly right. You’ve got everything. I just need the letter, and hopefully, this insurance company will let me travel! It’s a bit stressful dealing with all this.
DOCTOR: Okay. To complete the assessment and write that letter, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, just to check your heart, lungs, and blood pressure. Nothing too involved. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh. Um. Yes, I suppose so. If it's necessary for the letter, then yes, go ahead. I just… I’m not very good with doctors, if you know what I mean. It brings back… memories. But if it will help, then please do.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. It's perfectly alright to feel anxious. We'll take it slowly and I'll explain everything as we go. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs with the stethoscope. Just breathe normally. Deep breath in… and out… again… Good. Everything sounds clear. No wheezing or crackles. Now, let’s check your blood pressure. 120 over 80. That’s a good, healthy reading. Do you have any pain anywhere?
PATIENT: No pain at all, no. Everything feels fine, really. It's just… this whole situation with the insurance. I’m just eager to get the letter and go on my trip. Is everything okay so far?
DOCTOR: Yes, everything sounds and looks perfectly fine. Your reflexes are normal, and your lymph nodes feel normal as well. Okay, all done. Everything checks out beautifully. Based on my examination and the information you’ve provided, I can confidently write a letter stating that you are medically fit to fly. Just a few moments while I compose it. Do you have any specific requests for what should be included in the letter?
PATIENT: Oh, thank goodness! No, not really. Just that it states I'm healthy enough for long-haul flights, if that helps. I’m travelling to Mongolia, it’s quite a long journey. And… maybe mention I don’t have any underlying conditions? That’s what the insurance company seemed most concerned about. Thank you so much, Dr. DeCosta.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I’ll include a statement confirming your fitness for long-haul travel and specifically mention the absence of any underlying medical conditions. Okay, here’s the letter. Please review it to make sure everything is accurate. I’ve also included a copy for your records. Here's the statement regarding your fitness for long-haul travel and absence of underlying conditions. Do you have any questions about it?
PATIENT: Yes, this looks perfect. Everything is accurate. Thank you so much, Dr. DeCosta. You’ve been wonderful. I really appreciate your help. I think this will finally get me on my trip.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Kiante! I’m glad I could help. Have a wonderful and safe trip to Mongolia! Don't hesitate to reach out if you need anything else in the future. And please, enjoy your travels. .
