DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. GuerreroloLopez. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Piet. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Um… well, it’s my ear. Feels… blocked, you know? Like something’s stuffed in there. It’s been… a while now, I think. Honestly, time gets away from me. It’s just… full. Is that… right?
DOCTOR: Okay, a blocked ear. I understand. “Full” is a good way to describe it. And you said it’s been going on for a while… can you give me a little more detail on that?
PATIENT: A while… honestly, I’m not the best with dates. Months, maybe? Perhaps longer. It’s not painful, not really. Just… annoying. Makes it hard to hear sometimes, especially… quieter things. I do a lot of work outside, so loud noises aren’t a problem. But conversations… sometimes I have to ask people to repeat themselves.
DOCTOR: Alright, so not painful, mostly annoying, and affecting your ability to hear in conversations. That's helpful. Have you noticed any other symptoms alongside the fullness?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… hmm. Let me think. No dizziness, I don’t think. No ringing… or maybe a little, sometimes, but it’s so quiet I’m not sure if it’s actually there. Oh! And sometimes, when I… when I swallow, it feels a bit odd in my ear. Like a little pop, or pressure change. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes sense. A pop or pressure change when you swallow is good information. Have you experienced any discharge from the ear?
PATIENT: Discharge? No, no discharge. Definitely not. I… I keep it pretty clean, you know? Agricultural Inspectors, we get dirty, but I try to be careful. No, no liquid coming out. Just… full.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. No discharge is a positive. Now, have you had any ear problems in the past?
PATIENT: Ear problems… honestly? I… vaguely remember something when I was a child. An infection, maybe? But it was so long ago, I really can’t recall the details. My wife… she always handled the doctor’s appointments. It’s been a few years since she… well, nevermind. It was just a childhood thing, I think. Nothing recent.
DOCTOR: I understand. That’s alright if you don’t remember specifics. And I'm sorry to hear about your wife. Okay, let's move on. Do you take any medications regularly?
PATIENT: Medications… just the usual, for my blood pressure. A small dose, every morning. And… oh, sometimes a pain reliever for my knees, when they act up. But that's only when I need it, not every day. Nothing for my ears, no.
DOCTOR: Okay, blood pressure medication daily and pain reliever as needed. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Not that I know of. I get a little itchy sometimes when I’m around certain flowers, but that’s just hay fever, I think. Nothing serious. No reactions to any medications, as far as I can remember. My wife always double-checked that, too.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. Okay, Mr. GuerreroloLopez, I’m going to take a quick look in your ear with an otoscope. It will only take a moment, and it shouldn't be uncomfortable. Just let me know if anything feels painful.
PATIENT: Okay, sounds good. Just… try to be quick, if you could? I have a field to check on this afternoon. But yes, go ahead. Let me know if it hurts, you said.
DOCTOR: Okay… I see some cerumen – that’s earwax – present, and the ear canal appears a little inflamed. The tympanic membrane – that's your eardrum – is slightly dull in color and doesn't move as freely as it should. It's not a severe blockage, but it is noticeable. It looks like you likely have a buildup of earwax with some possible mild inflammation. This is quite common.
PATIENT: Inflammation… earwax… so, it is something? I was starting to think I was imagining it. What does that… what does that mean exactly? Is it… serious? Will I need… pills?
DOCTOR: No, it’s not necessarily serious, Mr. GuerreroloLopez. It's a pretty common issue. The ear naturally produces wax to protect the ear canal, but sometimes it builds up and causes blockage. The mild inflammation is likely from the blockage itself. And no, you likely won't need pills. In most cases, we can address this with a simple earwax removal. We have a couple of options: We can try a gentle irrigation, or I can manually remove the wax with special instruments. The irrigation is generally less invasive, but manual removal might be faster. Do you have a preference?
PATIENT: Irrigation… or… the other thing? Hmm. Less invasive sounds better, I suppose. I’m not keen on anything poking around in there, if you don’t mind. So, irrigation, then. Is it… painful? And how long will it take? I really need to get back to the fields this afternoon.
DOCTOR: Okay, irrigation it is. It's generally not painful, Mr. GuerreroloLopez. It might feel a little strange – a sensation of fullness or pressure – but it shouldn’t hurt. We’ll use body-temperature water, and I’ll stop immediately if you feel any discomfort. It should only take about 15-20 minutes, including prep time. I’ll warm the water, and then use a syringe to gently flush out the earwax. We'll then check again to make sure all of the wax is removed. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Fifteen minutes… alright, that I can manage. As long as it doesn’t hurt. Yes, let’s do it. Just… be gentle, please. And let me know if you see anything… unusual.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. GuerreroloLopez. I will be as gentle as possible. I’ll let you know if I see anything concerning during the procedure. Now, if you could just lie down on your side with the affected ear facing up. I'll start with a quick visualization to ensure everything looks as it should before we begin.
PATIENT: Okay, lying down. Affected ear… this one? . Yes, this one up. Go ahead. Just… hurry, if you could? The sun doesn't wait for anyone.
DOCTOR: Yes, this is the affected ear. Everything still looks as we discussed. Okay, let's proceed with the irrigation. I’m going to gently warm the water and then slowly introduce it into your ear canal. If you feel any pain or discomfort, please let me know immediately. How does that feel?
PATIENT: It’s… warm. A bit strange, like water in my ear, obviously. No pain… yet. A little bit of pressure, maybe? It feels… full, but not uncomfortable. Just… different. Keep going, I suppose. But please, stop if it gets worse.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. No pain is good. I'm seeing some earwax starting to come out. I'll continue for a few more moments. Now, I'm going to slightly adjust the angle... Does that change anything?
PATIENT: A little bit of… popping now. Like when you go up in an airplane. It’s… unsettling, but not painful. The pressure feels… less, maybe? It's hard to say. It's just… a lot of sensation in there now. Are you seeing much wax?
DOCTOR: Yes, I'm seeing quite a bit of wax now, a nice, flaky, yellowish color. That's a good sign. The popping is normal as the pressure equalizes. I think we’re almost there. One more gentle flush… How does that feel?
PATIENT: A little… wetter now. And the popping stopped. It feels… lighter. Definitely lighter than before. Is it… done? Can you see if it’s all out? I really need to get going soon. The tomatoes… they don’t pick themselves, you know.
DOCTOR: Okay, I think we're done. Let me take a look. Yes, the ear canal looks significantly clearer now. The tympanic membrane appears normal, and I don’t see any remaining wax buildup. It looks like we got it all. How does your ear feel?
PATIENT: Oh. Well, it feels… normal. Definitely normal. Lighter, like you said. I can hear you much clearer now, too. Yes, much better. Thank you, Doctor. That was… surprisingly easy.
DOCTOR: Excellent! I'm glad to hear that. I'm happy we could get that sorted out for you. To prevent future buildup, I recommend avoiding using cotton swabs in your ear canal. They tend to push the wax further in. If you feel like you have a blockage again, please come back and see me, and we can repeat the procedure. Do you have any other concerns today, or are you all set?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s all. No more poking around in my ears, and I’ll avoid the cotton swabs. You’ve been very helpful, Doctor. Really. I appreciate you getting me sorted out so quickly. I really need to get back to the fields now.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. GuerreroloLopez. I’m glad I could help. You have a good day now, and try not to worry about those tomatoes too much! I’ll see you next time.
