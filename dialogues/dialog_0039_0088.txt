DOCTOR: Hello, Jaylyne. It's lovely to meet you. I'm Dr. Kamahele. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hi Dr. Kamahele, nice to meet you too. Um, well, it's this ringing in my ears. It's been happening for a little while now, and it's… annoying, to say the least. I just want to figure out what's going on, if that makes sense. I’d like to get this sorted quickly if possible, I have work, you know?
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely. Ringing in the ears can be very disruptive, especially with work. It is important to get it checked out. Hmm… a little while now, you said. Can you tell me a bit more about that?
PATIENT: Yeah, sorry. It started… maybe six weeks ago? It comes and goes. Sometimes it's just a little buzz, other times it’s like a high-pitched whine. It's not constant, thankfully, but when it is there, it's hard to concentrate. It’s worse when it's quiet, like at night before I fall asleep. I’m not sure what’s causing it, honestly. I haven’t, like, been around any really loud noises recently that I can think of.
DOCTOR: Okay, six weeks. And it varies in intensity – a buzz sometimes, a high-pitched whine at other times. Worse at night, when it's quiet… that’s helpful to know. No recent exposure to loud noises, you recall?
PATIENT: No, not really. I work at a restaurant, so there’s some noise, you know, chatter and music, but nothing that feels… different than usual. I don't go to concerts or anything like that. I used to listen to music pretty loud on headphones, maybe that could be it? But I haven’t done that in months, probably. It's hard to say, really. Is this something serious? I just want to know what I’m dealing with.
DOCTOR: Okay, restaurant work… some background noise, but nothing particularly loud. And you used to listen to loud music with headphones… hmm. It’s good you’ve thought about potential causes. It’s difficult to say definitively without a bit more information, but tinnitus – that’s the medical term for ringing in the ears – can have many causes. It could be something simple, but we want to rule out anything more concerning. Let me ask a few more questions, then I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, okay, that sounds good. Exam is fine. Just… the quicker we can figure it out, the better. I have a shift tomorrow, so I can’t be here all day. Sorry to be like that, it’s just… life, you know? What kind of questions are we talking?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, I understand completely. We’ll try to be as efficient as possible. No apologies necessary! Okay. First, have you noticed any hearing loss along with the ringing?
PATIENT: Um… that’s a good question. I haven’t really noticed any, not consciously. Like, I can still hear people fine when they talk to me. Maybe things sound a little… muffled sometimes? But I thought that was just because I was tired. Honestly, I don’t pay that much attention to my hearing. Is that bad?
DOCTOR: No, it’s not bad at all! Many people don’t notice subtle changes in their hearing until specifically asked. The fact you mention sometimes things sound muffled is good to know, though. Okay. Have you experienced any dizziness, vertigo, or a feeling of fullness in either ear?
PATIENT: No, not really. No dizziness or anything like that. My ears don’t feel full. I get a bit motion sick on boats sometimes, but that’s just… me. I haven't felt anything weird in my ears, just the ringing. It comes and goes, like a little annoying friend. Sometimes I forget it’s even there. Is there a reason you're asking about dizziness? I’m a bit worried now.
DOCTOR: I’m just trying to gather all the information. Dizziness can sometimes accompany ear problems, but it's good that you haven’t experienced that. No need to worry just yet. Okay. Have you noticed any changes in your balance?
PATIENT: No, my balance is fine. I'm pretty steady on my feet, even after a long shift at the restaurant. I walk around a lot, carrying trays and stuff, so I would notice if my balance was off. I haven't stumbled or anything like that. I’m definitely not clumsy, thankfully. Does this mean it’s not serious? Sorry to keep asking.
DOCTOR: No, please, ask away! It’s good you're observant and aware of your body. The fact you haven't noticed any balance issues is reassuring. Okay, last few questions for now. Have you been experiencing any headaches, or any pain in your ears, jaw, or neck?
PATIENT: No headaches. And no pain in my ears, jaw, or neck. Sometimes my shoulders are a little tight after work, from carrying things, but that’s just… work, again. No actual pain, though. I’m starting to think I’m just stressed. Maybe it’s that? I just got divorced a few months ago, so things have been a little hectic, to say the least. But I thought the ringing started after the worst of it was over.
DOCTOR: I see. A recent divorce… that's a very stressful life event, and it can manifest in many ways. It’s entirely possible stress is a contributing factor, even if the ringing started a bit later. But we still need to rule out other potential causes, just to be safe. Alright. Shall we do a quick physical exam?
PATIENT: Yeah, okay, let’s get it over with. I appreciate you listening, Dr. Kamahele. The quicker we figure this out, the better. I really need to get back to work, so… let’s go. What do I need to do?
DOCTOR: Absolutely. We'll keep it quick and efficient. First, I’m just going to take a look in your ears with this instrument - it’s called an otoscope. Then I’ll do a simple hearing test with these tuning forks. Just relax, and let me know if anything feels uncomfortable, okay?
PATIENT: Okay, sounds good. Just… don't poke anything too far in there, please? Sorry, I'm probably being silly. I just… don't like things going in my ears. Go ahead.
DOCTOR: No worries at all! I promise I’ll be very gentle. It’s perfectly reasonable to feel a little apprehensive. Okay… left ear looks clear. No visible inflammation, wax buildup, or foreign objects. Right ear… also clear. No obvious abnormalities. Okay, now I’m going to test your hearing with this. Tell me when you can no longer hear the tone. Alright, hearing seems… slightly diminished in both ears, but not drastically. It's subtle, and could be normal variation. Now, let's do a quick Weber and Rinne test, just to be thorough. These help me assess how sound travels through your inner ear.
PATIENT: Okay, sounds good. I can’t really tell the difference between sounds, to be honest, so… whatever you think is best. I’m just trusting you at this point. Hurry up though, please? I’m starting to get a little antsy. I can feel my shift slipping away.
DOCTOR: Okay, all done. The tests indicate some slight conductive hearing loss in both ears, which aligns with what I initially heard. It’s not severe, but it’s something we need to consider. So, based on what you’ve told me and the physical exam, it sounds like you're experiencing tinnitus, likely with a mild degree of conductive hearing loss. There are several possible causes. It could be related to stress, as you mentioned, but it could also be due to past exposure to loud noises, even if it wasn’t recent. Or it could be something else entirely.
PATIENT: Okay… so what does that mean? Do I need medicine? Surgery? Am I going deaf? This is getting stressful all over again. I just want it to stop, you know? What do I do now?
DOCTOR: Okay, deep breaths. You’re not going deaf, I want to assure you of that. The hearing loss is mild, and the tinnitus doesn’t necessarily mean you’re losing your hearing. First, let's talk about what's causing this. Because the tests didn’t give me a definitive answer, I'd like to recommend a hearing test with an audiologist. They have more specialized equipment and can get a more detailed assessment. It’s a simple, painless procedure. In the meantime, there are a few things you can do. Try to manage your stress levels – easier said than done, I know, but things like meditation, yoga, or even just spending time in nature can help. Avoid exposure to loud noises as much as possible. And try to get enough sleep. I’m not going to prescribe any medication at this point, as there aren't any medications specifically for tinnitus, and they often have side effects. Surgery isn’t indicated either, given the mild nature of the hearing loss. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Okay… so a hearing test with someone else. And try to relax. Got it. That's… a little less scary than I thought it would be. I can probably manage that. How do I find an audiologist? Do you have a recommendation? And will this cost a lot of money? I have insurance, but I don’t want a huge bill. Sorry, I’m being practical again. I just need to know what I’m dealing with financially.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, it’s perfectly reasonable to ask about cost and referrals. Let me give you a list of audiologists in the area who are in-network with your insurance. I recommend calling them directly to schedule an appointment and confirm their fees. Most insurance plans cover a significant portion of the cost of a hearing test. It’s always a good idea to ask about payment options as well. I can also send a referral to your insurance company, which may help with coverage. I’ll also write a brief note for the audiologist outlining my findings and concerns. Do you have any questions about the referral process or anything else we’ve discussed?
PATIENT: Okay, that’s really helpful, thank you. I think I’m good for now. A list of audiologists and a referral… that’s all I need. I appreciate you taking the time to listen and explain everything, Dr. Kamahele. It was a little stressful, but you made it easier. Hopefully, the audiologist can figure out what's going on and I can finally get some peace and quiet. I guess… that’s all. Thank you again. Can I go now? I really need to get to work. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Jaylyne. It was my pleasure. I’m glad I could help. Yes, you can absolutely go now. Please don't hesitate to schedule a follow-up appointment with me if you have any concerns or questions after seeing the audiologist. I wish you all the best, and I hope you find some relief soon. Have a good day, and good luck at work! .
