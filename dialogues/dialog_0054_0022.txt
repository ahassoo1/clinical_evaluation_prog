DOCTOR: Good morning, Soila. My name is Dr. Dashevsky. It's nice to meet you. Why don't you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor… Dashevsky, yes? It’s nice to meet you too. Hmm… what brings me in… Well, my tummy feels… big. Not fat, just… puffy. And I don’t want to eat much anymore. Everything just… sits. You know? It's been a little while now, maybe a few weeks. I don't really keep good track of time these days.
DOCTOR: Okay, "puffy" and not feeling hungry, and food just sitting… a few weeks, you said. That gives us a starting point. To help me understand what's going on, could you tell me a little more about that “sitting” feeling?
PATIENT: Oh, yes… sitting. It’s… hard to explain. Not pain, exactly. More like… a rock is there. After I eat, it just… stays. Like it doesn’t want to go down. It’s uncomfortable, but not bad bad, you understand? And sometimes… my tummy makes noises. Gurgly noises.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. A feeling of fullness, like something is stuck, and some gurgling sounds. That does help. Now, have you noticed any changes in your bowel movements at all?
PATIENT: Bowel… movements? Oh dear. You mean… going to the bathroom? Well… not much. Everything is… slow. It's not often, and when it does happen… it’s… small. Not like it used to be. I used to go every day, you know? Regular as clockwork.
DOCTOR: Okay, so slower and less frequent bowel movements than usual, and smaller in size. That's helpful. Have you noticed any blood in your stool, or any changes in the color?
PATIENT: Blood? Oh… I don't think so. I haven’t really… looked. It’s… not something I pay attention to, usually. The color… hmm. Maybe a little lighter? But I eat so little these days, I’m not sure if that means anything. Everything just… blends together.
DOCTOR: Alright. We can certainly check those things. Now, have you been experiencing any nausea or vomiting at all, or any unexpected weight loss?
PATIENT: Nausea… oh, sometimes, yes. But not much. Just a little queasy in the mornings, but it passes. I haven't… thrown up, no. And weight loss… well, I have lost some weight, I think. My clothes feel a little looser. But I haven’t weighed myself in… oh, a long time. I don’t really bother with that anymore.
DOCTOR: Okay, some morning queasiness, some weight loss, but no vomiting. Let's talk about other things you might be experiencing. Have you had any pain anywhere else – perhaps in your chest, back, or abdomen besides the fullness you described?
PATIENT: Oh… well, my back sometimes aches. Old age, you know? But not much pain, really. Just a dull ache. And maybe a little… discomfort in my tummy, sometimes. Not sharp, just… a pressure. Like something is pushing.
DOCTOR: Okay, a dull ache in your back and some pressure in your abdomen. Now, have you noticed any change in your appetite, aside from not feeling as hungry?
PATIENT: Oh yes, that's what I meant at the start! It's not just how much I eat, it’s… what I want to eat. I used to love pickles, you know? And herring. Now… nothing sounds good. Everything tastes… bland. Like cardboard, almost. Even the things I used to enjoy. It's very strange.
DOCTOR: Alright, so loss of appetite, and when you do eat, food tastes bland. Now, let's go through a bit of your medical history. Do you have any known medical conditions, like diabetes, heart problems, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh dear… that’s a hard question. I used to see a doctor back in Russia, a very good one, but… that was a long time ago. I don't really remember what he said. I think… maybe high blood pressure, once? But I took some pills for a while, and it seemed to go away. Nothing else, I think. I’ve always been pretty healthy, mostly.
DOCTOR: Okay, possible history of high blood pressure, managed with medication in the past. Do you recall what medication you were on, or when you stopped taking it?
PATIENT: Oh goodness, no. That was… decades ago. I don't remember the name of the pill, or even the doctor’s name, truthfully. Everything is… fuzzy. It was a small white pill, I think. But that doesn’t help much, does it?
DOCTOR: No, that doesn't help much. It's alright. We can work with what we have. Have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Surgeries… hmm. Let me think… I had my tonsils out when I was a little girl. And… maybe something with my appendix, once? But that was a long time ago, and I was very young. I don't remember much about it. It was… just a little haze.
DOCTOR: Okay, tonsillectomy and possibly an appendectomy in the distant past. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No, dear. Nothing at all. I don't like taking pills, if I can help it. I try to stay natural, you know? Just a little tea sometimes, if I'm feeling poorly. And maybe a biscuit with my tea. But no regular medications.
DOCTOR: Alright, no current medications. And do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. No, I don’t think so. I’ve never really had any trouble with that. Sometimes my skin gets a little itchy in the winter, but that’s just the cold, I think. Nothing serious. I can eat anything, mostly.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Finally, could you tell me a little about your family history?
PATIENT: Oh dear. My family… they were all very healthy, mostly. My mother lived to be a very old age, nearly ninety, just like me. My father died young, a heart problem, I think. And my brother… he had some trouble with his stomach, but I don't really know what. We weren’t very close, you see. It was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Alright, mother lived to a similar age, father died of a heart problem, and brother had some stomach trouble. Okay. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, dear. That’s fine. Whatever you need to do. I hope I’m not too much trouble.
DOCTOR: Not at all. Your heart sounds a little fast, but otherwise regular. Lungs sound clear. Now, I'm going to gently press on your abdomen to feel for any tenderness or abnormalities. Let me know if anything feels painful. I’m pressing gently here… does this feel tender at all?
PATIENT: Oh, that's… no, not really painful. Just… uncomfortable. Like a balloon, maybe. A little full. Here… It feels a little… tight here. But not bad bad, you understand? Just… noticeable.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. A slightly distended abdomen, a little tender to the touch, especially in the lower abdomen. I'm going to listen to your abdomen now with my stethoscope, to listen for any bowel sounds. Your bowel sounds are a little quiet. That could explain some of the discomfort. I'm going to check your reflexes now. Your reflexes are normal. Finally, I'm going to take your blood pressure and pulse. Your blood pressure is a little elevated. Overall, your exam findings suggest some abdominal distension, diminished bowel sounds, and slightly elevated blood pressure. I'd like to order some blood work and an abdominal X-ray to get a clearer picture of what's going on. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh my… that’s a lot of information. Blood work and an X-ray… Is something seriously wrong, Doctor? I don’t want to be a bother. And I don’t have insurance, you know. Is that going to be expensive?
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Soila. It’s good we're getting some tests done to figure things out. The blood work will help us look for signs of infection or inflammation. The X-ray will give us a better view of your abdomen and see if there's any blockage or other problems. The elevated blood pressure is something we should also keep an eye on. As for the cost, I understand you don't have insurance. Let me speak with the billing department and see what options are available to help you. We can discuss a payment plan if needed. It’s important to rule out anything serious, and these tests will help us do that. We’ll start with the blood work and X-ray, and then we can go from there. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh… a payment plan would be very kind, Doctor. Yes, that sounds… better. I don't want to be a burden. And yes, let’s do the tests. If it will help… then I’m willing. I just… I don’t want to be a trouble.
DOCTOR: You’re not a trouble at all, Soila. We're here to help. I’m going to have the nurse draw some blood and get you scheduled for an abdominal X-ray. It shouldn't take too long. While we wait for the results, let's discuss some things you can do at home. I recommend eating smaller, more frequent meals, staying hydrated, and avoiding foods that cause gas or bloating. Do you have any questions for me before we proceed?
PATIENT: Smaller meals… that sounds sensible. And I’ll try to drink more water. Hmm… well… what could be wrong, Doctor? Is it something serious? I’m a bit scared, you see. And… will it hurt? These tests, I mean.
DOCTOR: I understand your worry, Soila. It's natural to feel scared when you don't know what's going on. It's too early to say definitively what's causing your symptoms. The possibilities range from something relatively minor, like constipation or a mild stomach upset, to something more significant. That’s why we’re doing these tests, to get a clearer picture. The blood draw will be a quick pinch, and you might feel a little discomfort afterward, but it shouldn't hurt badly. The X-ray is painless; you'll simply lie still while the machine takes a picture. It’s important not to jump to conclusions before we have the results. We'll review them carefully and discuss the best course of action together. Do you have any family members or friends we can contact if needed?
PATIENT: Oh dear… family… Not really. My brother… he passed away a long time ago. And I haven’t spoken to any cousins in years. I live alone, you see. But that’s alright. I manage. You can contact me here. I’ll be at home.
DOCTOR: Alright, Soila. We have your contact information. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood. I’ll let you know as soon as the results are available, and we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, if you experience any severe pain, fever, or difficulty breathing, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Is there anything else I can do for you right now?
PATIENT: No, dear. I think… I think that’s all. Thank you for being so kind. I appreciate your patience. I’m a little nervous, but… I feel a little better knowing you’re looking into it.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Soila. I’m glad I could help ease your mind a little. We'll take good care of you. The nurse should be with you momentarily. Please don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. Now, I’ll leave you to rest and wait for the nurse. Take care.
PATIENT: .
