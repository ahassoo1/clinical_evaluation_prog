DOCTOR: Good morning, Kahrin. I’m Dr. Gorga. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning. Just here for the results, like we talked about. Quick as possible is good for me, if that's alright.
DOCTOR: Right, results… yes, of course. Quick is good. Hmm… let me pull those up here. Just give me one moment. It’s… it’s funny what gets lost in the system sometimes. Okay, here we are. So, it looks like we ran a standard blood panel and a urine analysis. Do you recall anything specific we were looking for?
PATIENT: Honestly? Not really. You just said a general check-up would be a good idea. I don't make a habit of memorizing why things are being done, just that they are. Is something… wrong?
DOCTOR: Well, "wrong" is a strong word. Your blood work… it shows slightly elevated white blood cell count. Not dramatically, but enough to warrant a little… investigation. The urine analysis was normal. Have you been feeling unwell lately?
PATIENT: No, not really. I've been… busy. Work’s been hectic. Honestly, I mostly just feel tired, but that’s pretty normal for me. What does “elevated” even mean in this case? Like, am I sick, or…?
DOCTOR: It means your body is fighting something off, potentially. It could be a minor infection, a reaction to stress, even just dehydration. It’s usually not serious, but we need to figure out the cause. Do you have any fever, chills, or night sweats?
PATIENT: No fever that I've noticed. Definitely no chills. Night sweats… sometimes? But I also use a pretty thick duvet, so it’s hard to tell if that’s normal or not. I work long hours in a warehouse, lots of physical stuff. Maybe it's just that?
DOCTOR: A physically demanding job can certainly contribute to fatigue. And yes, a warm duvet could explain the night sweats. Okay. Let’s go through a quick review of systems, just to be thorough. Any pain anywhere?
PATIENT: No, no pain. Just the usual muscle aches after a shift. Nothing I haven’t dealt with before. Everything else feels… normal. Is this going to take much longer? I have a delivery schedule to finalize.
DOCTOR: No, not much longer. Just a few quick questions. Any changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Um… no. Pretty regular. Sorry, is this… necessary? I came for the results, not a full medical history. I feel perfectly fine, honestly. Just tired.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Kahrin. I apologize if this feels extensive. The elevated white blood cell count is the reason for these questions. It’s a common precaution to rule out anything serious. Any nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. Absolutely none of that. Look, is it possible it’s just… stress? The warehouse is really pushing us right now, and I haven’t had a proper day off in weeks. My boss is… demanding.
DOCTOR: It’s certainly possible. Stress can absolutely affect your blood work. Okay. Let’s do a quick physical exam, just to be sure. Blood pressure, pulse, listen to your lungs and heart, basic stuff. Won't take long. If you could just hop up on the table for me?
PATIENT: Fine. As long as it’s quick. Let's just get this over with.
DOCTOR: Alright. Blood pressure is 128/76, good. Pulse is 72, regular. Lungs are clear. Heart sounds are normal. No murmurs. Any shortness of breath, even with exertion?
PATIENT: No. Absolutely none. Even lifting pallets, I'm fine. I'm used to it. Seriously, Dr. Gorga, is something seriously wrong? Because I'm starting to get worried now.
DOCTOR: No, I don't think anything is seriously wrong. Everything sounds normal. Your physical exam doesn't reveal anything concerning. Given your description of stress and the demanding job, it's possible the elevated white blood cells are a reaction to that. But, to be certain, I’d like to repeat the blood work in a week. And, just to rule out anything else, we could do a basic metabolic panel. It checks your kidney function and electrolytes. Would you be open to that?
PATIENT: Ugh. More blood tests? Look, I don't have insurance, remember? Every test is a cost. If you honestly think it's just stress, can we just monitor it? I can take a few days off next week, try to relax a little, and then get the blood work repeated? A metabolic panel sounds… expensive.
DOCTOR: Yes, you’re right, I do recall you being uninsured. Monitoring it is reasonable, given your situation. We can repeat the blood work next week and see if the levels have returned to normal. If they haven't, then we’ll discuss further options. In the meantime, try to get some rest, stay hydrated, and manage your stress as best you can. Do you have any questions for me?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers it. Repeat blood work next week. That’s all I needed to know. Thank you, Dr. Gorga. I appreciate you not making me do a million tests.
DOCTOR: You're welcome, Kahrin. If anything changes before then, or you start feeling worse, don't hesitate to call. Here’s a requisition for the blood work. The lab is on Elm Street. Have a good day, and try to relax.
