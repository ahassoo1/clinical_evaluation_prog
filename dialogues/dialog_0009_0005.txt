DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Tkac. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Petrimoulx. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor Petrimoulx. It is a pleasure to meet you too. I am here today, as I understand it, to be cleared for a stay at a senior living facility. A nice place, I am told. I make bread, you see, and my hands... well, they aren’t what they used to be. Makes it difficult to knead the dough properly, and I don’t want to risk falling while I'm working.
DOCTOR: I see. So, a medical clearance for placement at a senior living facility, and you're experiencing some difficulty with your hands and a concern about falls. That’s a very sensible reason to seek assistance, Mr. Tkac. We want to make sure you're safe and comfortable. To get a better picture of things, could you tell me a bit more about your hands?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. They ache, mostly. A deep ache, especially in the mornings, and after I’ve been working with the dough. Not always, mind you. Some days are better than others. And the grip… it isn’t as strong as it once was. I used to be able to lift very heavy sacks of flour, no problem at all. Now… well, I have to be careful. I drop things sometimes. Nothing serious, but enough to make me worry. I've not sought treatment for it before now, though. I thought it was just old age catching up to me.
DOCTOR: Okay, so aching, particularly in the mornings and after activity, and a noticeable decrease in grip strength. That’s helpful. And you said it comes and goes?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that is correct. Comes and goes. Some days I wake up and it’s barely noticeable. I can get right to the bread and not think twice about it. Other days... well, other days it takes a good hour for the stiffness to ease up, and even then, it doesn’t always go away completely. It’s unpredictable, that’s what bothers me. Makes planning… difficult. And I don't want to risk hurting myself.
DOCTOR: Unpredictable is certainly concerning. And wanting to avoid injury is very wise. Have you noticed any swelling or redness in your hands, along with the aching?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, no swelling or redness. Just the ache, and the weakness. Sometimes a little tingling, but that doesn’t happen often. It's mostly just the ache and the loss of strength. And like I said, it’s worse in the mornings. I try to stretch them out, but it only helps a little. I used to be able to work all day without a problem. Now I have to take breaks every hour or so. It's… frustrating.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Tkac. It sounds like this has been a gradual change, and it's impacting your daily life. Now, shifting gears a bit, could you tell me about any other medical conditions you have?
PATIENT: Yes, it has been gradual. A long time coming, really. As for other conditions... well, I have a bit of high blood pressure, but it's well-controlled with medication. Doctor Ramirez has been seeing me for that for years. And I had my gallbladder removed many years ago, but haven't had any trouble with that since. Otherwise… nothing major, I don’t think. I have the usual aches and pains that come with being eighty-one years old, but nothing that requires regular treatment. I try to stay active, walk when I can, and eat a sensible diet. Mostly sensible, anyway. I do enjoy a good piece of bread now and then.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear you’re staying active and eating well – even with a treat now and then! And it's helpful to know about the high blood pressure and gallbladder removal. Do you recall the name of the medication you take for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Yes, I do. Doctor Ramirez made sure I knew it well. It's Lisinopril. I take ten milligrams every morning. He checks it regularly, and it's been stable for quite some time. He's a good doctor, Doctor Ramirez. Very thorough. He always asks about how I’m sleeping and if I’m having any trouble with my memory. Which, thankfully, is still pretty good, I think. I remember everything just fine, usually. Except sometimes where I put my glasses, of course.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent, Mr. Tkac. Lisinopril, ten milligrams daily. Good. And it’s wonderful that your memory is holding up well – glasses aside, we all have those moments! Now, just to be thorough, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I do not. As far as I know, I have no allergies. I’ve eaten all sorts of things over the years, and never had a reaction. I used to go berry picking with my grandmother when I was a boy, and we’d eat them right off the bush. Never a problem. I’ve taken all sorts of medicines over the years as well, for colds and flus and the occasional injury, and never had an allergic reaction. I don’t believe I am allergic to anything. Which is a blessing, I think. It makes life a lot easier.
DOCTOR: That’s very good to know, Mr. Tkac. No known allergies. Now, before we move on to the physical exam, could you tell me a little bit about your family history?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. My mother lived to be ninety-two, a strong woman. She died peacefully in her sleep. My father… he didn't live as long. He passed away when he was seventy-two from a heart condition, I believe. He didn’t take very good care of himself, always smoking and drinking. As for siblings, I had one sister, but she passed away several years ago from cancer. And my son… he is still living, thank goodness. He lives in California, but we talk on the phone regularly. He is healthy as far as I know. I suppose there’s a bit of heart trouble on my father’s side, but nothing major on my mother’s side. I try to stay positive and take care of myself, like my mother did.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Tkac. That’s helpful information. Now, to get a better understanding of your overall condition, I’d like to perform a brief physical exam. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that is perfectly alright. Please proceed. I understand it's necessary. I've had plenty of physical exams in my life. Just let me know if anything feels uncomfortable, alright? I’m a bit stiff in the mornings, as I mentioned, so please be gentle. I don’t want to fall over or anything.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Tkac. I will be very gentle. We’ll take things slow and I’ll let you know what I'm doing every step of the way. First, I’ll check your blood pressure and pulse. Your blood pressure is 132 over 78, which is well-controlled, and your pulse is 72 and regular. Now, let's listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds regular with no murmurs, and your lungs are clear. Now, let's check your hands. Can you squeeze my fingers as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. That's good to hear about my blood pressure and lungs. I am glad everything sounds normal. There you go. Not as strong as they used to be, I'm afraid. It takes a bit of effort to grip. And sometimes it hurts a little. Like I said, it's worse in the mornings. You can feel the ache, I suppose? It's not a sharp pain, just a deep, dull ache.
DOCTOR: Yes, I can feel some mild discomfort with movement, and your grip strength is noticeably reduced compared to what I would expect. There's no swelling or redness, which is good. Now, can you spread your fingers apart as wide as you can?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. There you go. Not as far as I used to be able to. It feels a little stiff, like they haven't been used enough. I used to be able to play the piano, you see. But it's been years. And now, well, it's just too difficult. It hurts a little to stretch them out like that. I suppose I haven’t been taking care of them as well as I should have. Too much baking, not enough stretching.
DOCTOR: Yes, I see. Limited range of motion and some tenderness along the joints. Now, let's check your reflexes. Your reflexes are normal. Alright, Mr. Tkac, that completes the physical exam. Everything seems generally good, with the primary concern being the decreased grip strength and limited range of motion in your hands, along with the associated discomfort. Given your history and the exam findings, it sounds like you may be experiencing some early signs of osteoarthritis in your hands. However, to rule out other possibilities, I’d like to order some simple blood tests and an X-ray of your hands. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Osteoarthritis, you say? Well, I suppose that makes sense. My sister had something similar, I believe. It runs in the family, perhaps. Yes, Doctor, blood tests and an X-ray sound perfectly alright. Whatever you think is best. I just want to make sure everything is as it should be, and that I’m not missing anything. It's good to know what I'm dealing with, and to have a plan for moving forward. Thank you for taking the time to examine me so thoroughly. I appreciate your kindness and patience.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Tkac. It’s my pleasure. The blood tests will help rule out any inflammatory conditions, and the X-ray will give us a better look at the joints in your hands to confirm the osteoarthritis diagnosis. I’ll have the lab orders and X-ray request sent to the front desk now. You can schedule the X-ray at your convenience. In the meantime, I recommend continuing to stay active and maintaining a healthy diet. I’ll also give you some information on exercises you can do to help strengthen your hands and improve your range of motion. And we can discuss over-the-counter pain relief options, such as ibuprofen or naproxen, if needed. Once we have the results of the tests, we can discuss a more comprehensive treatment plan, which may include physical therapy or other interventions. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly alright. Information on exercises and pain relief options would be most helpful. I am happy to try anything that might help. Physical therapy sounds good as well. I don’t mind working a little to keep my hands strong. I want to be able to continue baking for as long as possible, you see. It's my passion, and it keeps me going. Thank you again for your help and guidance. You have put my mind at ease. I suppose I should head to the front desk to schedule that X-ray then?
DOCTOR: Yes, please do, Mr. Tkac. The front desk staff will be happy to assist you with scheduling the X-ray. In the meantime, I’ll have the nurse print out some handouts on hand exercises and over-the-counter pain relief options for you. And please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. It was a pleasure meeting you today, Mr. Tkac. I wish you all the best.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor Petrimoulx. The pleasure was all mine. I appreciate your kindness and thoroughness. I will be sure to call if I have any questions. And I will schedule that X-ray right away. Have a wonderful day, Doctor.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Tkac. You have a wonderful day as well, and please take care.
