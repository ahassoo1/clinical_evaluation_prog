DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Wartick. I'm Dr. Versace. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, it’s… rather embarrassing, to be frank. It’s a… a discharge. From down there. I haven’t… well, it’s not something a woman of my age discusses easily, you understand.
DOCTOR: Yes, well, these things happen. It’s why I’m here. Can you tell me a bit more about this discharge?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, I wouldn't be here if it wasn't concerning. It’s… yellowish. And there’s a… a smell. Not a pleasant smell, I assure you. And it’s been going on for… oh, goodness, maybe a week now? It's simply dreadful. I've always been very… clean, you see. This is quite out of the ordinary.
DOCTOR: A week, alright. And yellowish with an odor… Is it accompanied by any itching, burning, or pain, Ms. Wartick?
PATIENT: Oh, no, no pain. Not really. A little… discomfort, perhaps. Like a mild irritation. And no, thankfully, no itching. But the smell… it's quite persistent. I've tried… well, you wouldn't want to know what I've tried. It hasn’t helped, of course. A woman has standards, you know. It's just… unsettling.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any changes in your urination – frequency, burning, or difficulty?
PATIENT: Urination? Goodness, Doctor, what does that have to do with… this? I mean, I go to the bathroom when I need to, of course. It hasn’t been… different. No burning or anything like that. Truly, I don't understand why you're asking about that. Is this standard procedure?
DOCTOR: It’s standard to rule out other possibilities, Ms. Wartick. Sometimes these things are connected. It’s my job to be thorough. Now, let's move on. Are you sexually active?
PATIENT: Doctor! Really! Such a question! I… well, that is a very personal matter. Let's just say my… romantic life is not currently a priority. And I fail to see how that is relevant. Honestly, this consultation is becoming rather… intrusive. I came here for a medical opinion, not a personal interrogation.
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Wartick. I understand your discomfort. However, it's important information for determining potential causes. We can proceed without it, but it limits my ability to offer a precise diagnosis. Have you experienced any fever, chills, or lower abdominal pain?
PATIENT: Fever? Chills? Doctor, I’m not ill. I simply have… a discharge. And no, I have not been running a temperature or feeling poorly in any way. I assure you, I keep a very healthy constitution. Honestly, all these questions are quite unnecessary. I simply want this… issue… resolved. Can we not just prescribe something? A cream, perhaps?
DOCTOR: Ms. Wartick, I appreciate your frustration, but prescribing medication without a proper examination and potential testing would be irresponsible. I need to understand what we’re dealing with before I can recommend a course of treatment. I’m going to need to perform a pelvic exam. Will you allow me to do that?
PATIENT: A pelvic exam?! Absolutely not! Doctor, I came here for a simple problem, not… that! This is outrageous! I’ve never… I will be speaking to the office manager. This is a complete and utter waste of my time. I think I’ll just… handle this myself. .
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Wartick. However, I strongly advise you to reconsider. Ignoring a potential infection can lead to serious complications. I’ve documented your refusal of examination and testing. .
