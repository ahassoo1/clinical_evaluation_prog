DOCTOR: Good morning, Maribeth. My name is Dr. Glowka, and it’s a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. To start, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. It’s…well, it’s my breathing. It’s been troubling me. When I lie flat, it gets much worse. Like someone is sitting on my chest. I don't know if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense, Maribeth. That sounds quite uncomfortable. So, it's your breathing that's the primary concern, and it's specifically worse when you're lying down. That’s very helpful to know. Could you tell me a little more about when this started?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… It began… probably about three months ago, I would say. Maybe a little longer. It wasn't sudden, it just…gradually got worse. At first, I didn't pay it much mind. Just thought I was getting old, you know? But now it's keeping me up at night. It’s a bit worrisome.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s good you came in to get it checked out – it's always best to address these things, even if it is something minor. Gradual onset over three months… and now it’s affecting your sleep. Besides the feeling of someone sitting on your chest when lying flat, are you experiencing any other symptoms with your breathing?
PATIENT: Well… sometimes I wake up feeling a bit… breathless. Not a panic, mind you. Just… like I haven’t gotten a good breath in a while. And… I’ve noticed I've been a bit more tired lately, even after a full night’s sleep. Though, that could just be the summer heat, I suppose. I’m not sure. It’s hard to tell these days.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful information, Maribeth. Waking up feeling breathless and the increased fatigue are definitely things we want to explore. It's good you’re making those connections. While the heat certainly can contribute to fatigue, it's important to rule out other causes. Now, have you noticed any coughing associated with this?
PATIENT: Coughing? Not really. A little bit, perhaps, when I first lie down sometimes. Just a small one, to clear my throat. Nothing persistent. I don't have any sort of… phlegm, or anything like that. Just a dry little cough, now and then. It doesn’t keep me up or anything.
DOCTOR: Okay, a dry cough occasionally when lying down, but not persistent or productive. Good to know. Let's move on to some more general questions, if you don't mind. Do you have any pain in your chest?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, no pain. Just… discomfort. Like a tightness, or a pressure. It’s not sharp, or aching. Just… unpleasant. And it only happens when I'm lying flat. Sitting up, or walking around, I feel perfectly fine. It's very strange, really.
DOCTOR: That’s a key detail – the discomfort only when lying flat. It certainly helps narrow down the possibilities. Now, do you have a history of any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Let me see… I had my gallbladder removed many years ago. And I used to have high blood pressure, but it’s been well-controlled with medication for a long time now. Otherwise, no, nothing major. I’ve been pretty healthy, all things considered. Oh, and I had a bit of arthritis in my knees, but that’s just old age, I suspect. It doesn’t bother me much. Is that what you mean?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s exactly what I mean, Maribeth. Thank you for sharing that information. So, gallbladder removal in the past, well-controlled high blood pressure, and some arthritis. And are you currently taking any medications for your high blood pressure, or for anything else?
PATIENT: Yes, I take Lisinopril, 20 milligrams, once a day, for my blood pressure. And… sometimes I take Tylenol for my knees, but not regularly. Perhaps once or twice a week, if they're acting up. That’s about it, really. I try to avoid taking too many pills, if I can.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril 20mg daily and Tylenol as needed. That’s good to know. Now, are you allergic to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not that I know of. I’ve never had a reaction to any medication. I’ve had all my vaccinations, as recommended, but no allergies to report. My husband… bless his soul, he was allergic to penicillin, but I am not. I’ve always been quite lucky in that regard.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, Maribeth. No known allergies. Now, just a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no. Never touched a cigarette in my life. My mother smoked, and I saw what it did to her, so I vowed never to start. And I’ve always tried to lead a healthy life, as much as I can. I drink a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, but that's about it.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful, Maribeth. And how about alcohol?
PATIENT: As I said, just a glass of wine with dinner, Doctor. Perhaps four or five times a week. Nothing excessive. My husband and I used to enjoy it with our meals. It helps us relax, you know? But I don't drink any hard liquor, and rarely drink beer. Just a little bit of wine.
DOCTOR: Okay, a glass of wine with dinner a few times a week. And lastly, can you tell me a little bit about your family history?
PATIENT: Well… my mother had heart trouble later in life. She had to have a pacemaker, I believe. And my father had diabetes. On my husband’s side, his father had high blood pressure, as well. Other than that, not much that I know of. It's a rather large family, so it’s hard to keep track of everyone's medical history, if you understand what I mean. But those are the major things I recall. It feels like a long list, doesn't it? Is this all important, Doctor?
DOCTOR: It is a lot of information, Maribeth, and it's all very helpful. Family history of heart trouble, diabetes, and high blood pressure is important for us to consider. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and feel your legs to check for swelling. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly fine. Whatever you need to do. I’m ready when you are. I just want to get to the bottom of this breathing trouble. It’s a bit worrying, you know? But I trust your judgment.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Maribeth. I understand your concern, and we will do our best to figure out what’s going on. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a few deep breaths for me. Okay. Your heart sounds regular, but your breath sounds are a little diminished, especially in the lower parts of your lungs. Now, I’m going to check your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is a little elevated today, 148 over 88. Finally, I’m going to feel your legs for any swelling. No swelling in your legs, which is good. Okay, based on what you’ve told me and the preliminary findings of the exam, it sounds like we need to investigate this further. I suspect this could be related to fluid buildup in your lungs, potentially due to your heart not pumping as efficiently as it could, or a lung condition. It’s also possible your blood pressure is contributing. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order a chest X-ray, an EKG, and some blood work, including a BNP level to check for heart failure, and a complete blood count. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds… sensible. Whatever tests you think are necessary. I just want to know what’s going on, and get this sorted out. A chest X-ray, EKG, and blood work… yes, alright. When will I be able to have these done? And will you explain the results to me when they come back? I do get a bit flustered with medical terms, you know. I appreciate you being patient with me.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Maribeth. We will get those tests scheduled as soon as possible. The lab is right down the hall, and we can get an X-ray done before you leave today. The nurse will give you the paperwork you need. And of course, I will explain the results to you in detail, using plain language. I understand medical terms can be confusing, and I want to make sure you understand everything that’s going on. In the meantime, I'm going to start you on a low-sodium diet, and I recommend you check your blood pressure at home if you have a monitor. If your blood pressure is consistently high, we may need to adjust your Lisinopril dosage. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: Low-sodium diet… yes, I can do that. I used to cook with a lot of salt, but I can cut back. And… no, I don’t have a blood pressure monitor at home. But I can ask my granddaughter if she has one I can borrow. No, I don't think I have any questions right now. You’ve explained everything very clearly. I appreciate your patience with me. I just hope it’s not anything too serious. I’m ready to get these tests done, and get to the bottom of this breathing trouble. Thank you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Maribeth. We'll take things one step at a time. We'll get those tests ordered and scheduled now, and once we have the results, we’ll discuss them and formulate a plan. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood and schedule the X-ray. In the meantime, if you experience any worsening of your shortness of breath, or any chest pain, please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you need help getting up, or anything before we get started?
PATIENT: No, thank you, Doctor. I’m alright. I can manage on my own. Just… a bit anxious, I suppose. But I trust you to take good care of me. Just let me know when the nurse is coming, so I can be prepared. Thank you again for your kindness. I appreciate it very much.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Maribeth. I will let the nurse know to expect you. Please don’t hesitate to ask if anything comes up, even if it seems small. .
