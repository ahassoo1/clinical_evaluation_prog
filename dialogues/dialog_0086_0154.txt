DOCTOR: Right. So, Claudene Wease, 66 years old. And you’re here today because…?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Well, it’s… it’s my waterworks. They bother me. A lot. It’s been happening on and off, you see. Not a new thing, but… more frequent lately. I don't recall exactly when it started, to be honest. Just… a while.
DOCTOR: “Waterworks,” alright. And by that, you mean… frequent urination?
PATIENT: Yes, frequent. That’s a good word. And… a burning feeling. When I… go. It’s uncomfortable. Very uncomfortable. I take some… pills sometimes, but they don't seem to help much anymore. I can’t remember what they are, though.
DOCTOR: Pills… right. And you say this has been going on for “a while.” Can you try to be a little more specific?
PATIENT: Specific… Oh dear. That’s difficult. It feels like… years, certainly. Maybe five? Ten? Before my husband… left. Yes, before then, I think. It wasn't constant then, just… now and again. But it’s been worse the last year, maybe. Honestly, time just… slips away.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, we’re looking at potentially five to ten years of intermittent urinary issues, worsening over the last year with a burning sensation. Do you have any pain in your lower abdomen, Claudene?
PATIENT: Lower… abdomen? Oh. Sometimes, yes. A dull ache. Not a sharp pain, you understand. Just… a pressure. Like… something is full. Even when it isn’t. And… I feel tired all the time. Though, at my age, isn’t everyone?
DOCTOR: Tiredness is… common, yes. But it's good you mention it. Have you noticed any changes in your urine itself?
PATIENT: Changes…? Oh, goodness. Let me think. Sometimes it’s… darker. Not bright yellow, but… cloudy. And sometimes… I think there’s a little… blood. Just a little, mind you. I always hope it's just something I ate.
DOCTOR: Cloudy urine, darker coloration, and intermittent blood… Right. Okay. We're going to need to run some tests, Claudene. First, I'm going to need a urine sample. And then, I'd like to do a quick physical exam. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Tests… yes, alright. Whatever you think is best. A sample… that’s… easy enough, I suppose. Physical exam… Oh dear. I’m not fond of those, but… if it will help, then yes. Let’s get it over with. I have an appointment later this afternoon, you see, and I don't want to be late.
DOCTOR: Good. Let's start with the urine sample. I'll show you how to collect it properly. Follow me. And please try to remember any medications you've taken – even over-the-counter ones – as accurately as possible. It really does matter.
PATIENT: Yes, alright. Medications… Oh, I wish I could. My memory is just… dreadful. I’ll try, honestly, but don’t expect too much. I take something for my arthritis, I think. And… maybe something for my blood pressure? It’s all a bit of a blur. Let's just do the sample now, shall we?
DOCTOR: Alright. Just try to collect a mid-stream sample – that means start urinating, then collect about two ounces in the cup, then finish. And I'll be right outside when you're done. "Mid-stream… honestly, the simplest instructions…"
PATIENT: Oh. Mid-stream. Right. I think I remember that… maybe. Oh dear. This is all very stressful.
DOCTOR: Alright. Thank you. Now, if you could just hop up on the exam table, we’ll do a quick abdominal exam and listen to your abdomen. And then I’ll need to do a pelvic exam. It won’t be pleasant, but it's necessary to rule things out.
PATIENT: Pelvic exam…? Oh dear. Really? Is that absolutely necessary? I haven’t had one of those in… well, a very long time. I feel… rather vulnerable. Is there really no other way?
DOCTOR: Claudene, I understand it's not comfortable. But you're presenting with symptoms that require a thorough examination. We need to rule out infection, assess for any abnormalities, and get a clear picture of what’s going on. It's standard procedure. Frankly, skipping it would be irresponsible. I'll be as quick and gentle as possible, but it needs to be done. Now, if you could just lie back…
PATIENT: Oh… well. If you say so. I suppose you know best. I just… don't like being poked and prodded. Very undignified. Get it over with quickly, please.
DOCTOR: Alright. Deep breath. Any pain here?
PATIENT: No… well, a little pressure, perhaps. But not… sharp pain. Just… discomfort. Like a fullness. It's hard to explain.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, I’m just going to insert the speculum. It may feel cold and a little uncomfortable. I’ll be using lubricant. Try to relax as much as possible.
PATIENT: Oh… that is cold. And… uncomfortable. Very uncomfortable. Please… hurry. This is… quite distressing.
DOCTOR: Alright. I see some mild inflammation. No obvious lesions. Now I’m just going to do a bimanual exam. This will involve inserting two fingers. Again, try to relax. Uterus feels normal size. No palpable masses. Ovaries… a little tender on the left side. Alright. That's all. Wipe up. We'll send the urine sample for a culture and sensitivity, and I'll order a complete blood count and a basic metabolic panel.
PATIENT: Oh… that was… unpleasant. Very unpleasant indeed. Tender on the left side…? What does that mean? Is something wrong?
DOCTOR: Tender on the left side could indicate a number of things. It could be a mild infection, a cyst, or just muscle strain. The blood tests will help us rule out infection and other potential causes. The urine culture will tell us if there’s a bacterial infection. It's not necessarily serious, but we need to investigate. Honestly, you worry too much. We'll know more once the results come back. In the meantime, I’m going to prescribe you a short course of antibiotics, just in case. It won’t hurt, and it might alleviate your symptoms.
PATIENT: Antibiotics… alright. If you think it’s best. So… I have to wait for results? How long will that take? And… what if it is something serious? I don’t have anyone to… help me, you see. My husband… well, that’s a long story. I just want to feel better. And not have to worry all the time.
DOCTOR: The lab results usually take about 48 to 72 hours. I'll have the nurse call you with the results as soon as they're available. And frankly, worrying won't change anything. It's most likely a simple infection. As for not having anyone to help you… that's unfortunate, but it’s not a medical issue. Now, is there anything else?
PATIENT: No… no, I suppose not. Thank you, Doctor. I… I should be going, then. .
DOCTOR: Alright. Next patient.
