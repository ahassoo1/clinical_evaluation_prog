DOCTOR: Right. Edric McKinnon, 38 years old. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, it’s… my muscles, mostly. They just feel weak. It’s been going on for a little while now, and it's making things… difficult. I don't really know how to explain it better than that.
DOCTOR: “A little while” is rather vague, isn’t it?
PATIENT: Right, sorry. Um… maybe three, four months? It started gradually, just feeling tired after doing things, but now it's… noticeable even with simple stuff. Like, carrying groceries, or even just getting up from a chair. It’s not painful, just… hard. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: So, weakness…three to four months. And you say it's not painful, just…difficult. Can you pinpoint where you're feeling this weakness?
PATIENT: It's… pretty much everywhere, honestly. But I think it started in my legs, you know? Like, they feel heavy. And then it spread to my arms… it’s not awful in my hands, but lifting things is harder. It’s all over, really, but those are the places I notice it most. It’s weird.
DOCTOR: “All over” isn’t terribly helpful, Mr. McKinnon. Have you noticed any…changes in your diet recently?
PATIENT: Changes in my diet? Not really. I eat pretty much the same stuff I always have. I try to eat healthy, you know? Lots of rice and beans, some meat when I can afford it. I haven’t been skipping meals or anything like that. I don’t really cook much, mostly just…simple things. Why do you ask? Is that important?
DOCTOR: It’s important to rule things out. Weakness can stem from many causes. Have you experienced any recent weight loss?
PATIENT: Weight loss? Hmm… now that you mention it, maybe a little? I haven’t been weighing myself regularly, but my clothes do feel a bit looser. But honestly, I wasn’t thinking much of it. It’s been hot, you know? I figured I was just sweating more. I’m not trying to lose weight, if that’s what you’re asking.
DOCTOR: And what about your energy levels overall?
PATIENT: Energy levels… they’re low. Really low. I get tired just… thinking about doing things sometimes. I used to be able to work a full day, no problem. Now, I get exhausted pretty quickly. I’ve been sleeping more, but it doesn’t really help. It's like I'm always dragging myself around. It's frustrating.
DOCTOR: Do you have any family history of muscle weakness or…neurological problems?
PATIENT: Neurological problems… that’s a big word. Let me think. My grandfather, on my mother’s side, he… he had some trouble walking when he got old, but I don’t know what it was. Just… old age, I guess. No one else that I know of. My mom's side is mostly in Yemen, and we don't keep in close contact. I don't know anything about their health. Is that helpful? I wish I knew more.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you take any medications, or have any allergies that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No medications, not regularly. I take ibuprofen sometimes, for headaches, but that's it. And allergies… just hay fever, I think. Gets pretty bad in the spring, makes me sneeze a lot. Nothing serious. I don’t have any reactions to anything I know of.
DOCTOR: Very well. If you don’t mind, I'd like to do a brief physical exam, just to get a better sense of things. We'll check your reflexes, strength, and a few other basic things. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s fine. Whatever you need to do. I just want to figure out what’s going on, you know? I’m happy to help however I can. Just let me know what I need to do. I’m ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Alright. Please have a seat on the table. I’m going to start with your reflexes. Relax your legs. Hmm. Patellar reflexes are…slightly diminished. Now, can you squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: Okay. Is that okay? It feels… harder than it used to. Not painful, just… difficult. I'm trying, I promise.
DOCTOR: Yes, I see. Grip strength is…reduced bilaterally. Now, could you push against my hands, like you're trying to stand up?
PATIENT: Like this? It’s… hard to push. I feel like I’m barely doing anything. I don't know if I'm doing it right. It's just… weak. Really weak. Is this what you were expecting?
DOCTOR: Yes, I anticipated some difficulty. Now, I'd like you to stand, please. Hmm. Your gait is…somewhat unsteady. Now, I'm going to palpate your muscles. This will just involve me pressing on different areas to check for tenderness. Any pain with this?
PATIENT: Okay… yeah, that’s a little unsteady, I admit. Ouch. That’s… a little tender, yeah. Not sharp pain, just… sore. It’s been sore for a while, actually, I just didn’t mention it. It feels… tight, too. And it’s the same on both sides. Does that help? I just want to get this over with, if you don’t mind.
DOCTOR: Alright. Based on what you've told me, and the limited exam, it seems we need to consider a few possibilities. Your symptoms – progressive weakness, fatigue, reduced reflexes, and muscle tenderness – could be indicative of several things. It's too early to make a definitive diagnosis, but we need to rule out some more serious conditions. I'm going to order some blood work. A complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a creatine kinase level to check for muscle inflammation. I also want to order a Vitamin D level. That can sometimes contribute to weakness. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: Blood work… okay. That sounds… thorough. Vitamin D? I don’t really spend much time in the sun. Um… what are you thinking it could be? You said a few things. Is it something serious? I'm a little worried now, if you don't mind me saying so. And how long will it take to get the results? I just want to know what’s going on and… get back to normal, you know?
DOCTOR: Well, Mr. McKinnon, it's important not to jump to conclusions. Several conditions can cause these symptoms. It could be something relatively benign, like a vitamin deficiency, or it could be something more complex, like a neuromuscular disorder or even an autoimmune condition. The blood work will help us narrow down the possibilities. It's unlikely to be anything immediately life-threatening, but we need to investigate. The results usually take about 3-5 business days. Until we have the results, I recommend avoiding strenuous activity. And try to get some rest. I'll also prescribe a Vitamin D supplement, just to be on the safe side. It won’t hurt, and it may provide some temporary relief. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No allergies, like I said before. Just hay fever. Okay. Three to five days… I guess I'll just wait then. Avoiding strenuous activity… that’s not a problem, thankfully. I haven't been doing much anyway. Will you call me with the results, or do I need to schedule another appointment? I just want to make sure I don’t miss anything. And… is there anything else I should be doing in the meantime? Anything I should be watching out for? I just want to be prepared, you know?
DOCTOR: I'll have the nurse schedule a follow-up appointment for you once the results are in. That will give us time to discuss them properly. In the meantime, if you experience any sudden or severe weakness, difficulty breathing, or any changes in your vision, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. But for now, try not to worry. It's likely nothing serious. Do you have any other questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s everything. Thank you, Doctor. I’ll just… wait for the call then.
