DOCTOR: Good morning, Gedalya. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. IUzzolino. It's nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Well, it’s… it’s a bit hard to explain. I’ve been feeling weaker, progressively so, over the last few months. And my eyelids… they feel heavy, and they’re drooping a bit. It’s becoming quite noticeable, actually.
DOCTOR: Okay, weakness and drooping eyelids… progressive, you said?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. It didn’t happen all at once. It started… I’d say maybe six months ago with just feeling a little more tired than usual. Now… well, lifting things is harder, and I find myself having to concentrate just to keep my eyes open sometimes. It’s… unsettling.
DOCTOR: Alright. And can you describe the weakness a bit more?
PATIENT: Um… it's not like a sudden injury kind of weakness. It’s… all over, really. My arms, my legs… even my face feels a bit… sluggish. It’s harder to hold things steady, and I get tired quickly when I’m doing anything physical. Even walking feels more effortful than it used to. Does that make sense? I’m not very good at explaining these things.
DOCTOR: It does, Gedalya, it does. So, a general weakness that’s been building over six months. And you mentioned your eyelids… is it both eyes, or just one?
PATIENT: It’s both eyes, Doctor. Though, I think… I think my right eyelid is drooping a little more noticeably than the left. It’s hard to tell for sure, I suppose. I’ve asked a friend, and they confirmed it's both, but said the right one is worse. It's mostly just… uncomfortable. And makes me look very tired, I suspect.
DOCTOR: Okay. Have you noticed any changes in your vision?
PATIENT: Vision… hmm. Not really, I don’t think. Everything seems clear enough. Maybe a little blurry sometimes, but I wear glasses anyway, so I just assumed it was my prescription needing updating. I had my eyes checked about a year ago, though, and they said everything was fine. It’s not like double vision or anything. Just… normal blurry-glass wearing vision. I hope that makes sense.
DOCTOR: It does. Now, let’s talk a bit about your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Well… not really. I had the usual childhood illnesses – measles, chickenpox, that sort of thing. And I broke my arm when I was a teenager, playing football. But no serious illnesses, no. I’ve always been fairly healthy, to be honest. And no regular medications, if that’s what you’re asking. Nothing I take daily.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. And any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: No, sir. No surgeries at all. Never had the need for them, thankfully. Just the broken arm, and that was just a cast. Nothing… invasive.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, let's talk about your family. Has anyone in your family had similar symptoms to what you’re experiencing?
PATIENT: Hmm… that's a difficult question. My mother… she had some problems with fatigue later in life, but she attributed that to stress and… well, just getting older. And my grandfather on my father’s side… he had some muscle problems, but I don’t know exactly what. It was a long time ago, and nobody talked about it much. I don’t recall anyone having drooping eyelids like me, though. It’s not something I’ve specifically thought to ask about, to be honest. I’m divorced, so my ex-wife’s family is… not a source of information for me.
DOCTOR: Okay, fatigue in your mother, muscle problems in your grandfather. And no known eyelid issues. Now, just a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I don't smoke, never have. I… I used to drink occasionally, socially. A glass of wine with dinner, that sort of thing. But I stopped about a year ago. It wasn’t agreeing with me. And no, definitely no recreational drugs. I’ve never been interested in them. I’m a fairly… quiet person, really. I prefer a good book to… well, anything like that.
DOCTOR: Okay. And finally, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Not that I’m aware of, no. I've never had a reaction to anything, as far as I know. No food allergies, no drug allergies… I’ve had the usual vaccinations, of course, but no adverse reactions to those either. I don't have any known allergies at all.
DOCTOR: Alright, Gedalya. Thank you for answering all those questions. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. It will just involve checking your reflexes, strength, and looking in your eyes and ears. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds perfectly fine. Please, go ahead. I’m happy to cooperate however I can. I just want to figure out what’s going on.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you could just sit up on the examination table for me, that would be great. First, let's check your reflexes. Okay, reflexes are a little diminished, but not significantly. Now, let’s test your strength. Can you squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Is that alright? I'm trying to squeeze as hard as I can, but it feels a little weak, honestly. It’s… harder than it used to be. Is that what you’re looking for?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's exactly what I'm looking for. And you're right, your grip strength is somewhat reduced. Not dramatically, but noticeable. Now, let's move on to your eye muscles. Could you follow my finger with your eyes without moving your head?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I’m following your finger. It feels… a little tiring, actually. My eyes feel like they’re working harder than they should. Is this normal?
DOCTOR: Okay. Your pupils are equal and reactive to light. The back of your eyes look… normal, but I do see a little bit of… pallor of the optic disc. It’s subtle, but it’s worth noting. Now, let’s listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath for me. Your heart sounds good, a little fast, but otherwise normal. Your lungs are clear. Alright, Gedalya. That was helpful. Based on what you’ve told me and the quick exam, I’m concerned about possible… neuromuscular weakness. The drooping eyelids, the general weakness, the reduced reflexes and grip strength… and the pallor I saw in your eyes. It’s too early to say definitively what’s going on, but it could be something like… myasthenia gravis, or possibly a vitamin deficiency. We’ll need some tests to rule things out.
PATIENT: Myasthenia… what was that? And a vitamin deficiency? Is… is it serious, Doctor? I’ve been feeling increasingly worried about this, and now… you’re saying it could be something significant? What kind of tests are we talking about? Blood tests? And what happens if it is something like myasthenia… whatever that is? I’m starting to get quite anxious.
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety, Gedalya. It's good to be informed, and I’ll do my best to explain. Myasthenia gravis is an autoimmune condition that affects the communication between your nerves and muscles, causing weakness and fatigue. It's not always serious, but it does require treatment. As for the tests, yes, we’ll start with blood tests. These will check for antibodies associated with myasthenia gravis, as well as look for vitamin deficiencies—specifically, vitamin B12 and vitamin D. We may also need to do a more specialized test called an electromyography, or EMG, which measures the electrical activity of your muscles. It sounds a bit scary, but it's not usually painful. If it is myasthenia gravis, there are treatments available that can help manage the symptoms and improve your quality of life. These include medications, and in some cases, surgery. We'll discuss all of your options if it turns out to be that. But let's not jump to conclusions yet. The blood tests will give us a better idea of what's going on. I'll write you a requisition for those now, and you can get them done at the local lab. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: No, I… I think I understand. Blood tests and… possibly an EMG. And medication if it’s myasthenia gravis. The local lab… yes, I know where that is. Just… how long will it take to get the results? And… is there anything I should be doing in the meantime? Avoiding strenuous activity? Should I… should I be worried about driving? I work as a facilities manager, Doctor, I need to be able to get around. This is all a bit overwhelming. I’m not very good with medical things, if you couldn't tell.
DOCTOR: It's alright, Gedalya. It is a lot to take in. The blood tests should take about a week to come back. The EMG, if we decide to do that, may take a little longer to schedule, maybe another week or two. In the meantime, I would advise you to avoid strenuous activity. You don’t need to completely stop working, but try to avoid heavy lifting or anything that causes significant fatigue. As for driving… yes, it would be best to be cautious. If you’re feeling weak or fatigued, it’s best not to drive. We'll discuss the results as soon as they come in. And if your symptoms worsen at all before then – if you experience any difficulty breathing or swallowing, or any new or concerning symptoms – please go to the emergency room immediately. Here’s the requisition form for the blood tests. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I… I think that’s all for now. Difficulty breathing or swallowing… that’s… concerning. I’ll be careful. And I’ll avoid strenuous activity. Thank you, Doctor. For explaining everything, and for not… dismissing my concerns. I suppose I’ll… I’ll go get the blood tests done. And I’ll wait. Thank you again. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Gedalya. I'm glad I could help. Please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your results come back. We’ll get to the bottom of this. Take care, and I’ll see you soon. .
