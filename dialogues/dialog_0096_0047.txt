DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Rover. Cleo, is it?
PATIENT: Yeah, Cleo. Just Cleo is fine. It's... good to meet you, Doctor. Vilma, right? Folks told me you were the one to see about... well, about getting things sorted for later on. My wife, bless her, she always liked to plan ahead. I ain't always been good at that part.
DOCTOR: Vilma is fine, yes. And it’s good of you to come in, Cleo. Planning ahead is sensible. Many men leave it too late, then it becomes… difficult. Now, you said "getting things sorted for later on." Could you elaborate on that for me?
PATIENT: Well, she... my wife, Margaret, she talked about... long-term care, I think? Like, if I... if I needed help someday. Staying somewhere... safe. She had some papers, but I... I don’t rightly remember where she put 'em. Mostly, she just wanted to make sure I wouldn't be a burden. I think it was about insurance, too. She handled all that stuff. I just... worked. You know, moving things, hauling stuff. It's all a bit fuzzy, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Right. Insurance and long-term care. That’s… common. It sounds like you're concerned about potential future needs, which is responsible. Let’s try to piece this together. Do you have any idea what kind of long-term care she was looking into?
PATIENT: Not really. She mentioned a place... maybe near the water? She always liked the ocean. But I don't know if it was a real place, or just something she was thinking about. It was... a few years back now, and my memory ain't what it used to be. She talked about help with... everything, I guess. Bathing, cooking... stuff like that. But the details... they slip my mind. I mostly just remember her worrying, and me telling her I was strong enough to handle things. I was wrong, I suppose. Now… I’m not so sure.
DOCTOR: Alright. We can certainly explore your options. It’s good you're coming to terms with that now. Before we get into potential facilities, let's get a general picture of your overall health. Have you been seeing a regular doctor?
PATIENT: Yeah, Doc Henderson. Been going to him for… oh, a long time. Maybe fifteen years? He’s a good man. Mostly just check-ups, you know? Blood pressure, cholesterol… the usual. I broke my wrist a few years back, hauling lumber, but it healed up fine. I haven’t been sick, not really, in… well, I can’t rightly remember the last time. Just aches and pains, like you'd expect. Old age creepin' in, I reckon.
DOCTOR: "Old age creeping in," as you say. Henderson, you said?
PATIENT: Yeah, Doc Henderson. Down on Elm Street. Good fella. He always told me I was stubborn as a mule, though. Said I didn’t take care of myself enough. Probably right. I always thought I was tough enough to push through it, but… things change, I guess. You know? He's got a nurse, Sarah, she's real nice too. They both always fussed over my blood pressure. Always a bit high, they said.
DOCTOR: Right. I’m pulling up Dr. Henderson’s records now. Hmm… Yes, I see the notes about your blood pressure. It has been consistently elevated. And the wrist fracture, 2020, a clean break, healed well. Any other significant medical history I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Not that I recall. I had the flu when I was a kid, real bad, but that was… a long time ago. And I think I had pneumonia once, but it was a long time ago, and Doc Henderson said it didn't matter. Mostly, I've just been lucky, I guess. Strong stock, my mother always said. Aleut blood, you know? Tough people. But even tough people get worn down eventually. I just... ain't been to the doctor much in the last few years. Been busy. Workin'. Still am, though not like I used to.
DOCTOR: Alright. No significant allergies?
PATIENT: Allergies… Hmm. Not that I know of. Never had any trouble with bee stings or poison ivy. I eat everything Margaret put in front of me, and she liked to try new things. Spicy things, sometimes. No, I don't think I'm allergic to anything. Never had a reaction to anything, not that I remember. I don't think so.
DOCTOR: Very well. And are you currently taking any medications, prescription or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: Nope. Not a one. Doc Henderson always wanted me to take something for my blood pressure, but I always refused. Said I didn't like taking pills. He'd sigh and tell me I was stubborn. Still am, I guess. Just a bit of aspirin now and then for a headache, but that's about it. Margaret used to take something for her arthritis, but I don't mess with that stuff. Never been one for pills.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, let’s do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your reflexes, and take your blood pressure, of course. And I'd like to do a basic neurological assessment, just to check your memory and coordination. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that's fine. Whatever you need to do. I ain't worried about it, not really. Just want to get this sorted out, like Margaret wanted. I reckon checkin' things is a good idea. I… I might forget some things, though. Like I said, my memory ain't what it used to be. But I'll try my best. Just be patient with me, Doc.
DOCTOR: Very well. Please have a seat on the examination table. We'll start with your blood pressure. It's a little high, as expected. 150/90. Not alarming, but certainly something we need to address. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs with this stethoscope. Just breathe normally. Heart sounds are regular, but a slight murmur. Not concerning at this time, but we'll keep an eye on it. Lungs are clear. Now, let’s check your reflexes.
PATIENT: Alright. Whatever you say, Doc. I always hated going to the doctor, even when I was a kid. Margaret used to hold my hand. Ooh, that's a bit jumpy, ain't it? Never been good with those things. I used to work with heavy machinery, you see. Always had quick reflexes, but not always the best control. Still, I got by. Mostly.
DOCTOR: Reflexes are brisk, perhaps a bit exaggerated. Not necessarily a cause for concern, but we'll note it. Now, I'm going to ask you a few simple questions, just to assess your cognitive function. Nothing complicated. Can you tell me today’s date?
PATIENT: Today’s date… Hmm. Let me think… It’s… August, right? August… and… Is it the first? No… I think it's the second. August the second. 2025. Yeah, I think that's right. Margaret always kept track of dates. I never was very good with remembering those things. Is that right?
DOCTOR: August second, 2025, is correct. Now, can you tell me where we are today?
PATIENT: Where we are… Oh, this is… a doctor’s office, right? Doctor Burlingham’s office. It’s… suburban, I think? Margaret liked the quiet neighborhoods. Lots of trees. A nice, clean place. Is that what you mean? I ain't real good with places, Doc. I mostly just focus on the work.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, I'm going to ask you to repeat three words for me. I'll say them, and then I'll ask you to remember them later. Are you ready?
PATIENT: Yeah, I reckon so. Three words, huh? Okay. I'll try my best. Just… don't make 'em too complicated, Doc. My brain ain't what it used to be. Go ahead. I'm listenin'.
DOCTOR: Very well. The three words are: apple, table, penny. Apple, table, penny. Now, can you repeat them back to me?
PATIENT: Apple… table… and… Penny! Yeah, apple, table, penny. I think. Are those right? It’s funny, they seem to slip away quick. Like tryin’ to hold water in your hands. Did I get ‘em right?
DOCTOR: Yes, you got them correct. Now, let's move on to a simple calculation. If you have ten apples and you give three away, how many apples do you have left?
PATIENT: Ten apples… and I give three away… Hmm. Let me see… Seven! I have seven apples left. Is that right? It’s easy when you say it, but sometimes it gets mixed up in my head. Seven apples, right? I hope I got that one right. Margaret used to say I was good at numbers, but… I don’t know. My brain’s a bit foggy today.
DOCTOR: Seven is correct. Now, let's proceed with the physical examination. I'm going to check your cranial nerves. This involves checking your vision, facial movements, and ability to swallow. Please follow my instructions. First, can you close your eyes tightly and then open them?
PATIENT: Sure, Doc. No problem. Like this? Eyes closed… and eyes open. Feels a bit dry, actually. Been staring at bright lights a lot lately, workin' on the docks. Is that what you wanted? Should I blink a few more times? Sometimes my eyes get a bit tired.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's fine. Now, I’m going to ask you to smile for me. And now, I'm going to touch your tongue with this tongue depressor. Please open your mouth.
PATIENT: Like this, Doc? It feels a bit funny, stickin' that thing in there. Used to get poked a lot as a kid, I reckon. Still, I’m tryin’ to cooperate. Is everything alright? My tongue feels… normal, I think. A bit rough, maybe, from the salt air.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, I'm going to check your strength and coordination. Please extend your arms out in front of you, palms up. Now, please close your eyes and touch your nose with your index finger.
PATIENT: Like this, Doc? They’re a bit shaky, sorry about that. Been doin’ a lot of heavy liftin’ lately. Oops. A bit off, sorry about that. My brain ain’t always connectin’ properly. It’s like… a delayed reaction. Still, I’m tryin’ my best. Is that what you were lookin’ for?
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, let’s check your gait. Please stand up and walk a few steps forward.
PATIENT: Alright, Doc. Here goes. It’s a bit stiff, sorry about that. My knees ain't what they used to be. And I’m a bit off-balance, maybe. Is something wrong? I feel a bit dizzy, actually.
DOCTOR: Whoa, easy now. Yes, I noticed some unsteadiness and a slightly wide gait. And you mentioned dizziness. I’m going to have you sit back down. We'll take a moment. Now, I'm going to need to order some blood work and a CT scan of your head to rule out any underlying causes for these symptoms. Are you able to fast for the blood work?
PATIENT: Fasting… Hmm. What does that mean? Like… not eat anything? I usually have a big breakfast, you see. Eggs and bacon, mostly. Is that what you mean? And a CT scan… is that safe? Is it gonna hurt? I ain't too fond of machines, Doc. And I feel a bit shaky just thinkin’ about it. Is something serious wrong? I just wanted to get my affairs in order, like Margaret wanted. I didn't want nothin' serious.
DOCTOR: Alright, Cleo. Let’s take this one step at a time. Fasting means nothing to eat or drink after midnight tonight, just water. It's to ensure accurate results. As for the CT scan, it’s a painless imaging test that uses X-rays to create detailed pictures of your brain. It’s very safe, and it will help us rule out any potential causes for your unsteadiness and dizziness. It's standard procedure. Now, I don't want to jump to conclusions. But these symptoms could indicate a number of things, including a possible stroke, a neurological condition, or even a vitamin deficiency. We need to get these tests done to get a clearer picture. I'm going to call my nurse, Sarah, and she’ll explain the process and schedule the tests for you. Do you have any other questions right now?
PATIENT: A stroke… Oh dear. Margaret… she had a stroke, you see. That's what took her. I don't want that, Doc. I just want to be able to think clearly and get things sorted. Vitamin deficiency… is that bad? Is that what you think it is? I don't like machines, and I don't like hospitals. But if it’s the only way… I suppose I have to do it. Can Sarah explain everything? Like… how long it takes? And will it hurt? I get scared easy, Doc. And I don’t want to be a burden. Just tell me what I have to do.
DOCTOR: Alright, Cleo. I understand your concerns. We’re going to take this slowly, and I’ll ensure you're comfortable every step of the way. A vitamin deficiency is usually treatable with supplements, but we need to identify the specific deficiency first. The CT scan will rule out anything more serious, like a stroke or a tumor. Sarah will explain the process thoroughly. It takes about 30-45 minutes, and you'll be lying still on a table. It's painless, but the machine makes a whirring sound. You won’t be alone, and she’ll be right there with you. We'll get the results as quickly as possible. And to be clear, I'm not saying you have anything serious. These tests are just to be safe. I'll have Sarah come in and explain everything, and she’ll schedule the tests for you. In the meantime, try to relax. I’ll be right here, and we’ll get through this together. Sarah?
PATIENT: Alright, Doc. Thank you. I… I appreciate you explainin' it so clearly. It still scares me, but… it's better than not knowin'. I just hope Margaret… I hope she’s lookin' out for me. Just… let me know what happens, okay? I don’t want to be left in the dark. And thank you for callin' Sarah. I’m ready to get it over with, I suppose. Just… be gentle.
DOCTOR: Of course, Cleo. We will be as gentle as possible. I’ll explain everything clearly, and we won’t proceed with anything without your full understanding and consent. And I assure you, you won’t be left in the dark. Sarah will be here shortly to explain the process and schedule the tests. In the meantime, try to take deep breaths and relax. We’ll take things one step at a time.
