DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Kovtun. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Eriberto Bakan. It’s a pleasure to meet you. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Right, good morning. Just here for the results, as we talked about. I really don’t have time to go over everything again, if that’s okay. Just… what do they say?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Kovtun. I understand you’re pressed for time, and we can focus on the results. However, to ensure I provide you with the most accurate and helpful explanation, I will briefly recap what we discussed during your initial visit, and then we’ll go over the findings. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Briefly is good. Really briefly. I remember what I told you, and honestly, I don’t need a whole rehash. Just… the numbers. What do the numbers mean?
DOCTOR: Very well. As you recall, we discussed some fatigue and occasional dizziness, and I ordered a complete blood count, a basic metabolic panel, and a thyroid stimulating hormone test to investigate those symptoms. The complete blood count was within normal limits, ruling out anemia or infection as the primary cause. Your basic metabolic panel was also largely normal, with slightly elevated creatinine – 1.3 milligrams per deciliter – but that can be influenced by hydration and muscle mass. Your thyroid stimulating hormone was also within the normal range. Essentially, the tests don't show a clear, definitive cause for your fatigue and dizziness at this time. Does that make sense so far?
PATIENT: So… nothing’s wrong wrong? Just… I’m tired and get a bit dizzy sometimes? That's it? Is 1.3 a big number for the creatinine thing? I drink a lot of water, so… what does that even mean?
DOCTOR: That’s a very fair question, Ms. Kovtun. “Nothing wrong wrong” is a good way to put it, yes. The tests haven’t revealed an immediate, serious medical concern. However, it doesn’t negate the fact that you are experiencing these symptoms, and we want to understand why. Regarding the creatinine, 1.3 mg/dL is mildly elevated, but as you mentioned, you drink a lot of water, which can influence the result. It’s also important to consider your muscle mass – more muscle mass typically means higher creatinine levels. A normal range is generally considered 0.5 to 1.2 mg/dL for women, so yours is only slightly above that. It doesn't necessarily indicate kidney problems at this point, but it is something we should monitor. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to repeat the basic metabolic panel in one month, and I’d also like to ask a few more questions about your daily routine – specifically your diet and exercise habits – to see if we can identify any potential contributing factors. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Another blood test? Seriously? Look, I have a really busy schedule. Is there anything else I should be doing? Like, different vitamins, or… I don't know. Just… a quick fix? And one month is ages.
DOCTOR: I understand your reluctance to repeat the test, and I appreciate you voicing your concerns. I wouldn’t recommend another test if it weren’t potentially helpful. Repeating the panel will simply give us a baseline to compare against and ensure there are no changes. As for a “quick fix,” it’s important to remember that fatigue and dizziness can have many causes, and often there isn't a single solution. However, before considering any supplements or medications, let’s focus on lifestyle factors. Are you getting adequate sleep – typically 7-9 hours per night?
PATIENT: Look, I work a lot. Sleep is… when I can. Usually around six, maybe. Sometimes less. I eat when I can, mostly healthy stuff, though I skip breakfast a lot. I'm a logistics person, remember? Things don't always run on a schedule. Is that a problem? Honestly, is this even worth worrying about? It's just tiredness.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Ms. Kovtun. The demands of a logistics career are significant, and it’s not uncommon for sleep and dietary routines to be disrupted. While six hours of sleep can be sufficient for some, consistently less than seven hours can indeed contribute to fatigue and dizziness. Skipping breakfast can also impact energy levels. It's not that these things are necessarily “wrong,” but they are factors we need to consider. Given your busy schedule, let's focus on achievable changes. Would you be open to trying a daily multivitamin to ensure you’re getting essential nutrients?
PATIENT: A vitamin? Really? That feels… underwhelming. Is that all you’ve got? Look, I’m not trying to be difficult, but I was hoping for something more concrete. Is there a doctor I can see who specialises in… I don't know… energy problems? Someone who isn't going to suggest a multivitamin?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Kovtun, and I apologize if my suggestions feel inadequate. You are right to advocate for yourself and seek a specialist if you feel it’s necessary. While I haven’t identified a clear medical cause for your symptoms, it's possible a specialist could offer further insight. I would recommend a consultation with a neurologist. They specialize in the nervous system and could investigate potential causes of fatigue and dizziness that fall outside my area of expertise. Would you like me to provide you with a referral?
PATIENT: Yes, please. That would be great. A referral would be really helpful. And… is there anything else I need to do in the meantime? Just… keep drinking water, I guess? Look, thank you for not just dismissing it as “stress”. I appreciate that. .
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Kovtun. In the meantime, continuing to stay well-hydrated is excellent, and prioritize sleep whenever possible. While a multivitamin is a suggestion, it’s not essential. I’m glad I could provide a referral and that you feel heard. If you have any questions or concerns after your consultation with the neurologist, please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic. I wish you all the best, and thank you for coming in today. .
