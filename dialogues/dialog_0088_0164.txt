DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Ms. Haggar. I'm Dr. Piet. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Dr. Piet, it’s nice to meet you too. Well, it’s a bit… strange, honestly. I’ve been feeling really weak and tired, and my skin and eyes have been looking yellow. It started a few days ago, and my friend told me I really should come see a doctor. It seems to happen after I eat fava beans... which is odd.
DOCTOR: Okay, weakness, tiredness, and yellowing of the skin and eyes… and you’ve noticed this seems to happen after eating fava beans?
PATIENT: Yes, that's right. I didn't think much of it at first, because I haven’t eaten fava beans often, but it happened twice now. The first time, I just thought it was a fluke, maybe something else I ate. But then it happened again after I had some last week. It’s… unsettling. I don’t know what it could be.
DOCTOR: Alright. And aside from the yellowing and feeling tired and weak, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I’ve been feeling a little breathless sometimes, just with normal activity. And my pee has been… darker than usual, almost brown. I also have a bit of a stomach ache, but nothing too bad. Is that helpful? I’m not sure what’s important.
DOCTOR: Yes, that is helpful, thank you. Dark urine and shortness of breath are important things to note. And the stomach ache – where exactly is the pain located, and would you describe it as constant or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It’s mostly in my upper belly, sort of under my ribs on the right side. And it comes and goes, it’s not a constant pain. It’s more like a dull ache when I move around, or after I eat something. Not really sharp, just… uncomfortable. It’s not terrible, but I notice it. Oh, and I feel full really quickly when I eat, even if it's not much food.
DOCTOR: Okay, upper abdominal pain, especially on the right side, comes and goes, worsened with movement or eating, and feeling full quickly… all right. Let’s go through some basic questions, if you don’t mind. Do you have any known allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I haven't had any reactions to anything in the past, as far as I can remember. I've taken some antibiotics before, for a sore throat, and I’ve taken pain relievers like ibuprofen, and never had a problem. I’m usually pretty good with most things. I don't have any food allergies, other than maybe a slight sensitivity to dairy, but that’s just bloating, not a serious reaction.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. And are you currently taking any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, I don’t take anything regularly. Maybe a pain reliever if I have a headache, but that’s it. I used to take a vitamin D supplement in the winter, but I stopped a few months ago. I try to get enough sun when I can. I really don't like taking pills if I can avoid it.
DOCTOR: Alright, no regular medications. Now, have you had any major illnesses or surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: No, nothing major. I had my appendix removed when I was a teenager, that's about it. And I’ve had the usual childhood illnesses – chickenpox, measles, things like that. But nothing serious as an adult. I've been pretty healthy, all things considered. I always try to stay active, even if it's just walking.
DOCTOR: Okay, appendix removal as a teenager, otherwise pretty healthy. And what about your family history?
PATIENT: Hmm… that's a good question. My mother had some heart problems when she was older, and my father had diabetes. And I think my grandfather on my mother’s side had some kind of anemia, but I'm not sure what kind. It was a long time ago, and we didn’t talk about medical things much. I know it made him very tired, though. That’s about all I really know.
DOCTOR: Okay, heart problems in your mother, diabetes in your father, and possible anemia in your grandfather. We'll keep those in mind. Now, just a couple of social history questions. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, I don’t smoke. I used to drink a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, but I stopped a few years ago. And I definitely don't use any recreational drugs. I prefer a quiet evening at home with a good book, honestly. I try to live a healthy lifestyle, as much as I can.
DOCTOR: Alright, no smoking, no alcohol, no drugs, healthy lifestyle. Okay. Given your symptoms – the weakness, tiredness, yellowing of the skin and eyes, dark urine, and the connection to eating fava beans – it sounds like we need to investigate the possibility of a condition called Favism. It’s a genetic condition where people lack an enzyme that helps break down certain substances in fava beans. To get a better understanding, I'm going to need to do a physical exam and order some blood tests. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Favism? That sounds… serious. I've never heard of it. So it's the fava beans causing all this? Yes, of course, blood tests and a physical exam are fine. Whatever you think is best. I just want to know what’s going on and how to fix it. I feel so tired all the time.
DOCTOR: It can be serious, but it’s also manageable with proper care. And yes, it seems like the fava beans are a trigger. Okay, let's start with the physical exam. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, feel your abdomen, and check your skin for any signs of jaundice – that’s the yellowing we talked about. I'll also check your vital signs: blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. Then we'll draw some blood for the tests. Could you please lie back on the examination table?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. I hope it's nothing too serious. I just want to feel normal again.
DOCTOR: Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Your abdomen is slightly tender in the upper right quadrant, but there’s no significant enlargement. I notice some mild jaundice in your skin and eyes. Blood pressure is a little elevated but not concerning. Pulse and temperature are normal. Okay, that’s helpful. Based on the physical exam, your symptoms and the connection to fava beans, I want to order a complete blood count , a reticulocyte count, a bilirubin level, and a G6PD enzyme level test. The G6PD test will tell us if you have a deficiency in that enzyme. Do you have any questions about those tests?
PATIENT: Wow, that's a lot of tests. G6PD... that's the enzyme, right? Is it a painful blood draw? I’m a little nervous about needles, to be honest. And… how long will it take to get the results? I’m anxious to know what’s going on, and if I need to completely avoid fava beans for the rest of my life.
DOCTOR: It is a lot of tests, I understand. Yes, G6PD stands for glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase. It’s an enzyme that helps protect your red blood cells. As for the blood draw, it shouldn’t be painful, just a quick pinch. We’ll use a small needle, and the phlebotomist is very skilled. Regarding the results, it usually takes 24-48 hours for the lab to process them. I’ll call you as soon as they’re available. And to answer your last question, yes, if you are diagnosed with G6PD deficiency, you’ll need to avoid fava beans and certain other foods and medications that can trigger a reaction. But let’s not jump to conclusions yet. We need the test results first. We'll discuss everything in detail once we have them. I’m going to order the blood tests now. The nurse will come in to draw them shortly. Do you have any other questions for me before she comes in?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. That was very helpful. Just… I hope it’s not too bad. Thank you, Dr. Piet. I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Haggar. I understand your anxiety, and we’ll take things one step at a time. The nurse will be with you shortly. She’ll explain the blood draw process. If you have any questions for her, please don’t hesitate to ask. I’ll be in touch as soon as the results are available. .
