DOCTOR: Good morning, Mrs. Nini. I’m Dr. Sham. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Hmm… let me see. My… well, it’s about my blood. I need to know what kind it is. Just… for things, you know? My daughter, she said it would be good to know. It’s a bit silly, maybe, at my age. But better safe than sorry, I suppose. I don’t remember ever having it checked before.
DOCTOR: Blood type… right. Okay. And are you experiencing any particular symptoms, or is this purely for informational purposes, as your daughter suggested?
PATIENT: Oh, no symptoms at all, Doctor. Nothing like that. Perfectly fine, mostly. Just… a check-up, really. My daughter, bless her heart, she worries so. I don't even recall why she wanted me to know it, specifically. Just said it was important. Old age, you know? Things slip your mind. I don’t think it's anything serious, though. Is it a complicated thing to find out?
DOCTOR: No, it's a very straightforward test. A simple blood draw. We can certainly do that for you. I just… and please correct me if I'm wrong… it's not typical to request a blood type test without a specific medical reason. We’d usually do it if you were preparing for surgery, or had a medical condition that required knowing your blood type. But if your daughter feels strongly… we can proceed. Do you have any known allergies to latex or anything like that?
PATIENT: Oh, latex… hmm. I don’t think so. I’ve had a few scrapes and bumps over the years, and I don't remember anything bad happening with bandages. But it was a long time ago, you see? I truly can’t say for certain. My memory isn't what it used to be. Is it… is it alright if we just try it? If anything happens, you can stop, right? My daughter… she’s a very sensible girl. She wouldn’t send me if it was dangerous.
DOCTOR: Okay. We'll take a precaution and use latex-free gloves and supplies. Just to be safe. And yes, we will stop immediately if you experience any reaction. Now, before we proceed with the blood draw, let me just ask a few standard questions, routine things. Have you had any significant medical problems in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Significant… that’s a big word, isn’t it? Let me think. I had my gallbladder out, years and years ago. That was… maybe in the seventies? And I broke my wrist once, falling off a ladder. I was trying to fix the roof, silly of me, at my age. Nothing major, though. Just old age aches and pains, mostly. I've always been pretty healthy, all things considered. Worked hard my whole life, you see. A rigger, I was. Lots of lifting and climbing. But that was a long time ago. I… do those things matter?
DOCTOR: Yes, those things are helpful to know. The gallbladder removal… do you recall any complications from that surgery?
PATIENT: Complications… hmm. Not that I recall. It hurt afterwards, of course, like any surgery, but the doctor said that was normal. I was in the hospital for a few days, and then I went home and got on with things. I don't remember any problems, not really. It was a long, long time ago, you see? Everything gets a bit blurry after a while. I mostly remember my husband visiting me with flowers. He’s… he’s passed on now. A lovely man. But, no, no complications that I remember. Just a bit of pain.
DOCTOR: Alright. And any current medications you are taking?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see… just a little pill for my blood pressure. The doctor gave it to me a few years back. It's… a small white one. I take one every morning with my breakfast. And sometimes, if my arthritis is acting up, I take a little something for that, but not every day. Just when it really bothers me. I don't even know the names of them, truthfully. I just take what the doctor tells me to. My daughter handles most of that now. She’s very organized.
DOCTOR: Okay. Do you have any allergies to any medications, as far as you know?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s a good question. Hmm… not that I’m aware of. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything the doctor’s given me. I… once, when I was a little girl, I was stung by a bee, and my arm swelled up, but that wasn't a medicine, was it? Just a bee! And I’ve always been careful with what I eat. My mother taught me to be cautious. No, I don't think I have any allergies to medications. But, like I said, my memory isn’t the best. If anything does happen, you’ll know, won’t you?
DOCTOR: Yes, we'll monitor you closely. Alright. Now, before we do the blood draw, I’d like to quickly check your vital signs - your blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course, Doctor. Whatever you need to do. My blood pressure, you say? Is that the thing you checked last time? I do worry about that sometimes, all the aches and pains and everything. Just a quick check, you say? That’s fine. Go right ahead. I'll sit here quietly and try not to fidget. Is it cold? I always feel a bit chilly these days.
DOCTOR: Just a quick check, yes. And no, it shouldn't be cold. Your blood pressure is 148 over 82. A little elevated, but not drastically so. Pulse is 76 and regular. Temperature is 98.6, normal. Now, I’m going to need to draw a small amount of blood. We'll send it to the lab to determine your blood type and a basic blood count. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. That sounds… sensible. A small amount of blood, you say? Not much, then? I always worry about feeling faint. I did once see a film about a lady who fainted during a blood draw. It wasn’t a very nice film. But if you say it’s quick and just a small amount… go ahead. Just be gentle, please. And tell me if I need to breathe deeply, or anything like that. My daughter always tells me to breathe deeply when I'm nervous. Would that help?
DOCTOR: Just a small amount, yes. And I will be as gentle as possible. Breathing deeply will absolutely help. Just focus on taking slow, deep breaths. Alright, Mrs. Nini. I’m going to swab the area on your inner arm with alcohol. It will feel a little cold. Then, I’ll insert the needle. You may feel a brief pinch. Just breathe deeply… that’s good. Almost done… just a few more seconds. Okay, all done. Apply gentle pressure to the site for a few minutes. And we'll get a bandage on that. There you go. You should be fine. We’ll have the results back within a few hours. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That wasn’t so bad, was it? Just a little pinch, like you said. Thank you, Doctor. You were very gentle. My daughter will be relieved. And the results in a few hours? That's good. No, I don’t think I have any questions. Just… thank you. It’s nice to have it over with. It's silly, worrying about something like this at my age, I suppose. But better safe than sorry, right? She always says that, my daughter. Always looking out for me.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mrs. Nini. Yes, better safe than sorry. We’ll let your daughter know when the results are available. And if you experience any bleeding or discomfort at the site, please don’t hesitate to call the office. Otherwise, just try to rest and avoid strenuous activity for the rest of the day. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: Oh, no, Doctor, that’s all. Thank you very much for your kindness. And for putting my mind at ease. I appreciate it. Just rest… yes, that sounds nice. My daughter will be pleased to hear that too. She worries so much. I should probably be getting home now. She'll be expecting me. Thank you again, Doctor Sham. You're a very good man. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mrs. Nini. You take care now, and give your daughter my regards. It was a pleasure meeting you.
