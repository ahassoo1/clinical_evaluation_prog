DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Asthore. I’m Dr. Versace. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you. Well, it’s this weakness… getting worse, you see. Not all at once, but little by little. It’s making things… difficult. I was told to come see someone about my Multiple Sclerosis. Is that right, this is about that?
DOCTOR: Yes, I see here you've been diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis. And you’re right to be concerned about increasing weakness. Now, let's talk about this weakness specifically. When did you first notice it, and where did it start?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It started… oh, maybe six months ago? In my legs, I believe. Just felt a little unsteady when walking, you know? Didn’t think much of it at first. Old age, I figured. But then it spread… a little bit to my hands. Now, even holding things is sometimes… a struggle. It’s not constant, it comes and goes.
DOCTOR: Six months ago, starting in the legs. Intermittent, comes and goes, and now affecting your hands as well. Can you describe how it feels when it’s happening?
PATIENT: Well… it's hard to explain. Not pain, exactly. More like… heavy? Like my legs are filled with water, if that makes sense? And clumsy. I stumble more easily. My hands… they feel weak, like they might drop something. Not always, but sometimes. It’s… frustrating.
DOCTOR: Heavy and clumsy, with a feeling of potential dropping. Alright. And has anything specifically made it worse – certain activities, time of day, stress, temperature, anything like that?
PATIENT: That’s a good question, Doctor. Hmm… I think… when it’s very hot, it’s definitely worse. My wife, she notices it too. When we go outside on a warm day, I have to slow down more. And… I don’t know if this is important, but when I’m tired, it’s bad. Really bad.
DOCTOR: Heat and fatigue exacerbating the symptoms. That is pertinent information, Mr. Asthore. Now, let’s move on to other things. Have you noticed any changes in your vision?
PATIENT: Vision… let me see. Not blurry, not really. But sometimes… things look a little faded, you know? Not all the time, but a little less bright, maybe? It’s hard to explain. And sometimes, when I close my eyes, I see… little spots. Like stars. But they go away quickly. Is that… normal?
DOCTOR: Faded vision and transient visual disturbances—spots, you said?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, spots. Like when you look at the sun for too long, but smaller. And quicker. They only last a moment. It doesn't happen every time I close my eyes, but it's happened a few times. My wife said I should mention it. She's very observant, my wife.
DOCTOR: Alright. And aside from your legs, hands, and the vision issues, have you experienced any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… well, sometimes I get… very tired. More tired than usual, even before the weakness gets bad. And I think… my balance is a little off. I don’t fall, but I feel… unsteady. And sometimes, just a little… numb. In my feet, mostly. It comes and goes like everything else.
DOCTOR: Fatigue, balance issues, intermittent numbness in your feet... This all points towards a potential flare-up of your Multiple Sclerosis. Now, I’m going to do a brief neurological exam to get a better sense of what’s going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds… wise. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgement. I want to understand what’s happening, and I’ll do whatever I can to help.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you could sit up on the exam table for me?
PATIENT: There. A little slow, sorry. It's the legs, you see.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Asthore. We’ll start with your reflexes. Just relax. Now, I’m going to tap on your knees. Let me know if that’s uncomfortable. Good. A little diminished on the right side, but present. Now, can you close your eyes and tell me where my finger is?
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. I’ll try my best. … Is this to the right? It’s… a little hard to tell.
DOCTOR: A little to the left, Mr. Asthore. Now try the other hand. Diminished proprioception bilaterally, more pronounced on the right. Now, I'm going to check your gait. If you could stand and walk a few steps for me, please. Slowly, as you are comfortable.
PATIENT: Alright… just be careful… I’m a little wobbly, Doctor. Like that? Is that okay?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s fine. I see what you mean about the instability. A slightly wide-based gait with some mild ataxia. Now, let's return to the table.
PATIENT: Ataxia… that doesn't sound good, does it? What does that mean, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Ataxia simply means a lack of coordination. We’ve seen some mild evidence of that in your gait. Given your history and these exam findings, it does appear you’re experiencing a flare-up of your Multiple Sclerosis. We need to confirm this with an MRI of your brain and spinal cord. Have you had an MRI recently?
PATIENT: MRI… yes, I think so. Maybe a year ago? I forget… my wife usually keeps track of these things. I should have asked her before coming. Is an MRI… is that a big deal?
DOCTOR: It’s not a big deal, Mr. Asthore. It’s a painless imaging test. We’ll need to check when your last one was done to see if we need to repeat it. In the meantime, to manage your symptoms, I recommend a course of high-dose corticosteroids. They can help reduce the inflammation that’s causing the flare-up. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Corticosteroids… that sounds… like a strong medicine. Will that have… side effects? I'm not very good with all these medical words. My wife likes to read up on things, but I mostly just want to feel better.
DOCTOR: You are right to ask, Mr. Asthore. Corticosteroids do have potential side effects. They can cause things like increased appetite, temporary fluid retention, and sometimes elevated blood sugar. We will monitor you closely while you're on them. The benefits of reducing the inflammation, given your current symptoms, generally outweigh the risks in this case. We will start with a five-day course of intravenous methylprednisolone, followed by an oral taper. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Five days… and then pills? Okay. If it will help, then… yes. I trust your judgement, Doctor. But I’d like my wife to be there when you explain everything again, if that’s alright? She asks good questions.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Asthore. I encourage her presence. I will schedule you for an MRI as soon as possible and arrange for the intravenous steroids. I will also have my nurse contact you to discuss the logistics and schedule a follow-up appointment to review the MRI results and adjust your medication accordingly. We'll also need a baseline bloodwork panel before starting the steroids. Do you have any questions for me right now before we proceed?
PATIENT: Bloodwork… yes, that's okay. Hmm… just… will I feel better right away with the medicine? Or does it take time? And will this… flare-up… go away completely? My wife worries a lot.
DOCTOR: That’s a very valid question. You should start to see some improvement within a few days of starting the steroids, but it may not be immediate or complete. The goal is to reduce the severity of the symptoms and speed up your recovery. As for whether the flare-up will go away completely… many patients experience significant improvement with treatment, and can return to their baseline level of function. However, Multiple Sclerosis is a chronic condition, and flare-ups can sometimes recur. We will work with you to manage your condition and minimize the risk of future exacerbations. I want to be realistic - there's no guarantee, but we will do everything we can. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Yes… that makes sense. Not a guarantee… but you will try. I appreciate your honesty, Doctor. I think… I think that's all for now. We’ll wait for my wife and let her ask the questions. Thank you.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Asthore. I understand. My nurse will be in shortly to discuss the next steps and schedule your appointments. And please, don't hesitate to contact us if you have any concerns before then. Have a good day, and I look forward to seeing you both soon.
