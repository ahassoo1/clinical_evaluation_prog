DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Heidenthal. I am Dr. Pipkorn. It says here you’re 38 years old. Thank you for coming in today. What brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Hi Dr. Pipkorn. Yes, that’s right. Thirty-eight. Um… well, it’s my memory. It’s just… not what it used to be, you know? I’m forgetting things. Little things, mostly, but it's starting to worry me.
DOCTOR: I see. "Memory issues." And how long has this been going on, Ms. Heidenthal?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That's a good question… Hmm. It's hard to say exactly. Maybe… six months? It started with just misplacing things, like my keys or my phone. Now… it’s like I’ll start a thought and completely lose it. Or forget what I went to the store for, even as I’m in the store. It's frustrating!
DOCTOR: Frustrating, yes, I can imagine. And are these memory lapses…constant, or do they come and go?
PATIENT: It’s not every single day, but… more often than not. Some days are better, some are worse. It feels like… stress makes it worse, definitely. And if I’m tired. But even on good days, there’s always something I can’t quite remember. It’s unsettling.
DOCTOR: Unsettling, certainly. Now, Ms. Heidenthal, I'd like to get a more complete picture. Have you noticed any difficulty with tasks you've always found easy – things like paying bills, following recipes, or managing appointments?
PATIENT: Yes, actually. Paying bills… I’ve bounced a check twice this year, which never happens. And recipes… I used to love baking, but now I have to write everything down, even simple things, or I forget ingredients. Appointments… I've been double-booking myself a lot lately. It’s a mess, really. I feel so… disorganized.
DOCTOR: Okay. And have you experienced any changes in your mood or personality?
PATIENT: Changes in… my mood? Hmm. I don't know. I feel more anxious, I think. More easily frustrated. I used to be pretty patient, but now I snap at people sometimes, which isn’t like me at all. And I’m definitely sleeping worse. I wake up a lot during the night, thinking about things. Or… nothing, really. Just… awake. I don't know if that counts.
DOCTOR: It absolutely counts, Ms. Heidenthal. Sleep disturbances are quite relevant. Now, let’s move on to your medical history. Do you have any pre-existing medical conditions that we should be aware of?
PATIENT: Not really. I had strep throat a couple times as a kid, and I broke my arm once, but… nothing major. No diabetes, no heart problems, nothing like that. I do wear glasses, as you can see, and I get migraines occasionally. But I haven't been to the doctor in… oh, goodness, probably five years? Just for check-ups, you know? I’m generally healthy. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Generally healthy… okay. And have you had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything in the past?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that either. Never been in the hospital, thankfully. Just the usual childhood illnesses, really. And… I think I had all my vaccinations, but I’d have to ask my mom to be sure. It was a long time ago. I’m not very good with remembering things, as you can probably tell!
DOCTOR: Quite. Now, Ms. Heidenthal, family history is important. Are there any instances of dementia, Alzheimer's, or other memory problems in your immediate family – parents, siblings, grandparents?
PATIENT: Oh, that's… a good question. My grandmother, on my mother’s side… she had something. She wasn’t really with it towards the end. Mom always said it was “old age,” but… she did forget a lot. And she got very confused sometimes. I don't know if it was dementia or Alzheimer’s specifically, nobody really talked about it. My mom always handled everything. That's all I really know. It wasn’t a topic of conversation, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand. And finally, Ms. Heidenthal, could you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Sure. Um… I work as a dentist, as you saw on the form. It's pretty stressful, to be honest. Long hours, lots of pressure. I live alone. I try to eat healthy, mostly, but sometimes I just grab something quick when I'm busy. I don't really have a lot of time for exercise. I used to enjoy hiking, but it's been a while. And I don't drink or smoke. Is that enough information?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s quite helpful. Now, Ms. Heidenthal, before we proceed to a physical examination, I need to ask about medications and allergies. Are you currently taking any prescription or over-the-counter medications, including vitamins or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Just a few. I take a multivitamin, mostly because my mom tells me to. And I take ibuprofen occasionally for headaches. And… sometimes I’ll take a sleep aid, like melatonin, if I’m really struggling to sleep. That’s it, I think. Nothing regular, really. Oh! And I use an allergy medication during pollen season. Something with… loratadine, I think it’s called. Does that make sense? It’s all pretty standard stuff.
DOCTOR: Okay, multivitamin, ibuprofen as needed, melatonin occasionally, and loratadine for allergies. And are you allergic to any medications, foods, or other substances?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I’ve never had a serious allergic reaction. I’m a little sensitive to dust, sometimes, but that’s just a runny nose. Nothing life-threatening. I’m pretty lucky, actually. I really haven’t had any major health problems, until now, I guess.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's move on to a brief physical examination. I'll be checking your vital signs, neurological function, and a few other basic assessments. This will help me get a better understanding of your overall condition. Do you have any objections?
PATIENT: No, not at all. That sounds… good. I mean, whatever you need to do. I trust your judgment, Dr. Pipkorn. Just… let me know if anything feels… strange, okay?
DOCTOR: Certainly. We’ll start with your blood pressure. Please relax your arm. 130 over 80. Not bad. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Heart rate is regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. Patellar reflexes are normal bilaterally. And I'll check your cranial nerves. Your cranial nerves appear intact. Finally, I’m going to do a brief cognitive assessment. I’ll ask you a few simple questions to evaluate your memory and attention. Can you tell me today’s date?
PATIENT: Oh… Today’s date… Um… it’s… August. Definitely August. But the… number? Is it the 1st? No… Wait. I think it's the 2nd? August 2nd, 2025? I think. I’m so sorry. I’m usually better with dates. I just… blanked.
DOCTOR: August 2nd, 2025. Alright. And can you tell me the names of three objects in the room?
PATIENT: Um… let’s see. There’s… a chair, obviously. And… a desk. And… Oh! The lamp! Yes, the lamp. That was harder than I thought it would be. I feel awful. It’s like the words are… stuck.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, I'm going to ask you to repeat three words I'm going to say. Please try to remember them. The words are: apple, table, penny. Now, I'll ask you to recall those words later. Finally, I'm going to assess your gait and balance. Please stand up and walk a few steps for me.
PATIENT: Apple, table, penny… okay. It’s… a bit difficult. My balance doesn’t feel right today, to be honest. I feel… wobbly. Is this normal?
DOCTOR: Alright, please sit down. Thank you. Ms. Heidenthal, based on the initial assessment, your neurological examination revealed some concerning deficits in short-term memory and recall. Your gait appears slightly unsteady, and your balance is somewhat compromised. This, coupled with your reported symptoms and family history, warrants further investigation. I would like to order some blood work, including a complete blood count, thyroid panel, and vitamin B12 levels. Additionally, I recommend an MRI of the brain to rule out any structural abnormalities. Do you understand?
PATIENT: MRI…? Blood work, okay. I can do blood work. But an MRI… is that… serious? Is something wrong? I… I don't know. I understand that you want to check things, but… that sounds scary. What are we looking for exactly? And what if… what if it is something bad? I just… I'm really scared now.
DOCTOR: Ms. Heidenthal, it’s understandable that you’re feeling anxious. An MRI is a diagnostic tool. It allows us to obtain detailed images of the brain. It is not a definitive diagnosis. We are ruling out various possibilities – things like vitamin deficiencies, thyroid abnormalities, or any structural changes that might be contributing to your symptoms. It is important to be thorough, and it’s far better to identify any potential issues early on. I want to be clear: I am not suggesting that you have anything serious. However, given your symptoms and family history, it is prudent to investigate further. We can discuss the risks and benefits of the MRI in more detail. It is a relatively safe procedure. And I will be here to answer any questions you have. Before we proceed, are there any medications you’re currently taking that might contraindicate an MRI?
PATIENT: No… no contraindications, I don’t think. Just the multivitamin, ibuprofen, and the sleep aid occasionally. Nothing regular. I haven’t told my mom yet about this… She'll be so worried. I… Okay. If you think it's necessary, I'll do the MRI. But… can we talk about what to expect? And… what if they find something? What happens then? Will I have to… I don't even know. I just need to know what I’m getting into.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Heidenthal. I understand your concerns, and I will explain the procedure and potential outcomes as thoroughly as possible. The MRI involves lying still inside a large magnet. It is a painless procedure, though it can be somewhat claustrophobic. We can discuss options for managing any anxiety related to that. As for potential outcomes, if the MRI reveals any abnormalities, we will refer you to a neurologist for further evaluation and treatment. This might involve medication, therapy, or other interventions. However, it is important to remember that many conditions are treatable, and early detection significantly improves the prognosis. I will order the blood work immediately, and we will schedule the MRI as soon as possible. I will also provide you with a referral to a neurologist, preemptively, so that you are prepared. In the meantime, I recommend that you avoid driving or operating heavy machinery, as your symptoms could potentially impair your judgment. Do you have any questions about this?
PATIENT: No… I think I need some time to process everything. Driving… okay, I can do that. No driving. And… thank you. For explaining things. And for… not dismissing me. I’ve felt so silly lately, forgetting things. I’ll… I’ll call to schedule the MRI. And I’ll let you know if I think of any questions. I think… I think that’s all for now. Thank you, Dr. Pipkorn.
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Heidenthal. Please do not hesitate to contact the office if you have any questions or concerns. We’ll be in touch with the lab results and MRI scheduling information shortly. I wish you all the best.
