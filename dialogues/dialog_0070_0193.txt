DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Goodstein. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Abady. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. It is very nice to meet you as well. Well, it is… a bit embarrassing, to be honest. I have been… passing gas. A lot of gas. More than usual, you understand? It is… quite disruptive.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Goodstein. It can be quite bothersome when something like that becomes disruptive. There’s no need to be embarrassed; these things happen, and we can certainly look into it. To help me understand what’s going on, could you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Well, it started maybe… two weeks ago? Not suddenly, but slowly getting worse. It happens after I eat, mostly. Anything, really. Though… maybe more with beans? I do enjoy a good bean soup, you see. And… it smells quite strong, sometimes. My apartment… it is small. So, it stays in the air. It is… uncomfortable. I try to open the window, but it is August, and it is very hot. Do you understand?
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand perfectly, Mr. Goodstein. Two weeks of gradually increasing gas, particularly after meals, and you've noticed it seems worse with beans. And the odor is noticeable, especially given the size of your apartment. Now, besides the increased gas and odor, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Other symptoms… Well, my stomach does feel a little bloated sometimes, after eating. Not always, but often. And… perhaps a little cramping? Not bad pain, more like… discomfort. Like a little pressure. I do not have… any trouble going to the bathroom, if you understand. Regular, you see. And no… fever. No nausea. Just… the gas. And the bloating. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: That is helpful, Mr. Goodstein. Bloating and some mild cramping along with the gas. And no changes in bowel habits, no fever, no nausea – good to know. Now, have you noticed any changes in your diet recently, other than perhaps enjoying more bean soup?
PATIENT: Oh, yes! That is a good question, Doctor. Now that you mention it… I did start trying a new… probiotic yogurt. A friend recommended it for… digestion. It is strawberry flavored. I eat it every morning with my breakfast. Perhaps that is… the cause? It sounded good on the box. It said it had many… good bacteria. But maybe it is bad bacteria? I do not know. I am not a doctor, you see.
DOCTOR: You're right, you're not a doctor, and that's why you're here with me! It's quite possible the yogurt is related. Sometimes, even things marketed as helpful can have unintended effects. Now, Mr. Goodstein, let’s go over a little bit of your medical history. Do you have any known medical conditions?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, I do not think so. Nothing serious. My mother always said I was a strong boy. I have Medicare, you see, and they send me letters if there is something wrong. I see the doctor for my yearly check-up, and they always say I am… alright. Blood pressure is a little high sometimes, but nothing they worry about. I take a small pill for it. Lisinopril, I think it is called. Other than that… no. No diabetes. No heart problems. No allergies. I am a pretty simple man, Doctor. Just the gas, you see.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s good to know. No significant medical history, just some slightly elevated blood pressure managed with Lisinopril. No known allergies. And you have regular check-ups. Have you ever had any surgeries, Mr. Goodstein?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never. I have been very lucky, in that respect. I broke my arm when I was a boy, climbing a tree, but they just put it in a cast. No surgery. That is all. I am not a fan of hospitals, you see. They smell… unpleasant. And all the people… it is too much. I prefer to stay healthy, if I can. Just the gas, you see. A simple problem, hopefully.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly understandable, Mr. Goodstein. No surgeries, just a broken arm as a child. We'll certainly try to keep it a simple problem. Now, just to be thorough, could you tell me about any medications you’re currently taking, besides the Lisinopril?
PATIENT: Just the Lisinopril, Doctor. And sometimes… an antacid. For heartburn. After spicy food, you see. I like paprika. Just the small pink tablets. Tums, I think they are called. Not every day, only when I eat something… strong. Perhaps that also has something to do with the gas? Everything seems to be connected, you see. The yogurt, the paprika, the Tums… it is very confusing.
DOCTOR: Alright, Lisinopril for blood pressure and occasional Tums for heartburn. It’s good you mention everything, even the occasional medications. It is possible those could be contributing. Now, let's talk a little bit about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. My mother… she had high blood pressure too, I think. And my father… he had some trouble with his stomach, when he got older. Indigestion, mostly. But nothing serious. He lived to be 85, you see. A strong man. My sister… she is very healthy. No problems. As far as I know. We do not talk much, you see. So, not a lot of family history. Mostly strong people. Just the gas, you see. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: That’s helpful, Mr. Goodstein. A family history of some high blood pressure and some indigestion. Otherwise, generally healthy. And finally, just a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never. My mother always said it was bad for your lungs. And it smells… unpleasant. I do not like the smell. I drink… a small glass of wine with dinner sometimes. A red wine. But not every day. Maybe three or four times a week. Very small glass, you see. I eat… mostly simple food. Soup, bread, vegetables. I try to stay healthy. Just the gas, you see. It is the only problem.
DOCTOR: Okay, no smoking, occasional small glass of red wine, and a generally healthy diet. Alright, Mr. Goodstein, thank you for providing all of that information. It gives me a good picture of your overall health. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I’ll listen to your abdomen and check for any tenderness or bloating. Just a routine check to help me understand what’s going on.
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That is perfectly alright. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. I am happy to do whatever you need. I am just hoping we can find out what is causing the gas. It is… quite disruptive, you see. Please, go ahead.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you could lie down on your back for me, please. I’m just going to listen to your abdomen with the stethoscope. Try to relax and breathe normally. Okay, I’m hearing some normal bowel sounds – that’s good. A little bit of rumbling, which isn’t unusual with gas, but nothing concerning. Now, I’m going to gently press on your abdomen to check for any tenderness or bloating. Please let me know if anything feels painful. A little bit of fullness in the lower abdomen, but no sharp pain or tenderness. It feels a bit…distended, but not significantly. Everything else seems normal. Okay, Mr. Goodstein. Everything seems within normal limits on the physical exam, but I do agree that you have some abdominal distension. Given your history and the exam findings, it sounds like we’re dealing with excess gas, likely related to something you’re eating or drinking. The probiotic yogurt, the Tums, and even the paprika could be playing a role. Now, the key is to figure out which one, or if it’s a combination.
PATIENT: That makes sense, Doctor. It is good to know it does not sound… serious. Perhaps we can try eliminating things? Stop the yogurt, then the Tums, then… the paprika? It is a little sad to think about giving up the paprika, you see. But I am happy to try anything to get rid of the gas. What do you recommend?
DOCTOR: Exactly. That's a very reasonable approach, Mr. Goodstein. We can try an elimination diet to see if we can pinpoint the culprit. I suggest starting with the yogurt, as that's the most recent addition to your diet. Stop taking it for a week and see if your symptoms improve. Keep a food diary during that week, noting everything you eat and drink, as well as the severity of your gas. If the symptoms don't improve after a week, we can then stop taking the Tums, and then, as a last resort, reduce your intake of paprika. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding carbonated beverages and foods known to cause gas, such as beans, broccoli, and cabbage. Small, frequent meals can also help. Do you think you can manage that, Mr. Goodstein?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I can manage that. A food diary… it sounds a little complicated, but I can try. I have a notepad. And I will stop the yogurt immediately. No more strawberry yogurt, you see. And I will avoid the beans and broccoli. Small meals… that is easy. I already eat small meals. So, stop the yogurt for a week, keep a food diary, and avoid the beans and broccoli. Is there anything else? Do I need to… come back for another visit? Or should I just… tell you what I find in the food diary?
DOCTOR: That's perfect, Mr. Goodstein. You've got it. Stop the yogurt for a week and keep a detailed food diary. Note everything you eat and drink, and be sure to record the severity of your gas – maybe on a scale of 1 to 5, with 1 being mild and 5 being severe. After a week, please schedule a follow-up appointment with me. We can review the food diary together and see if we can identify any patterns. If your symptoms don’t improve after a week, or if they worsen, please call the office sooner. For now, I don’t think any further testing is necessary. We’ll start with this conservative approach. Does that sound good to you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds very good. Stop the yogurt for a week, food diary with a scale of 1 to 5, and follow-up appointment. I will do that. And if it gets worse, I will call. Thank you, Doctor. You have been very helpful. I feel much better already, just knowing what to do. It is… a relief. Perhaps I can finally enjoy my apartment again.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Goodstein. I'm glad I could help. I’m confident we can get this sorted out. Don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. Have a good day, and please let me know how it goes.
