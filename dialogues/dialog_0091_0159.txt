DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Fratoni. My name is Dr. Talen Delacour. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Please, have a seat. So, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doc. Pleasure to meet you too. Uh, well… it’s kinda weird, to be honest. It's just... getting out of a chair. It's been happening for a couple weeks now, and it's gettin' harder. Like, I gotta really push to stand up, and sometimes my legs feel kinda shaky when I do.
DOCTOR: I see. Getting up from a chair is becoming increasingly difficult, and you're experiencing some shakiness in your legs. That is worth investigating. To help me understand what might be going on, could you tell me a little more about this?
PATIENT: Yeah, it started slow. Just felt a little stiff, ya know? Like after sittin' a long time on a long drive. But now... it's even happenin' after just a few minutes. And it's not just any chair. It's kinda all of 'em. Like, at the diner, at home... even my truck seat. It's just... a struggle. I work out in the oil fields, so I'm used to bein' physical, and this just... don't feel right. I haven’t fallen or anything, just feels like I'm gonna.
DOCTOR: I understand. It began gradually with stiffness after prolonged sitting, but now it’s occurring even after short periods, across different chairs. And, importantly, this is unusual for you given your physically demanding work in the oil fields. That's helpful information. To get a clearer picture, could you describe the shakiness in your legs?
PATIENT: Well, it ain't like a full-on tremble, ya know? It's more… wobbly. Like my legs are jelly for a second. It's hard to explain. It usually goes away pretty quick, within a few seconds, but it's enough to make me kinda brace myself. Sometimes I gotta hold onto somethin', like the table at the diner, just to be safe. It’s in both legs, kinda even. Not worse on one side or the other.
DOCTOR: Okay, "wobbly" rather than a full tremor, affecting both legs equally and resolving within seconds. That's good detail. And you’ve said it’s been happening for a couple of weeks. Have you noticed anything else accompanying this—any pain, numbness, tingling, weakness in your legs, or changes in your balance generally?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No real pain, no. No numbness or tingling either. Balance feels… okay, I guess. I haven’t fallen or anything, like I said. But… now that you mention it, I have been feelin’ a little more tired lately. Just kinda run down, ya know? I figured it was the heat. It's been brutal out in the fields. But maybe… maybe it’s connected. I hadn’t really thought about it 'til now. Oh, and I guess my appetite ain’t been the best either, but honestly, it’s hard to eat much when it’s a hundred degrees out.
DOCTOR: Alright, so no pain, numbness, or tingling. You’ve noticed increased fatigue and a decreased appetite, which you attributed to the heat, but we'll keep those in mind. Now, let's go over some basics. Do you have any medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Nah, not really. I've always been pretty healthy. Had the flu a couple times, usual stuff. Broke my arm when I was a kid, but that healed up fine. No diabetes, no high blood pressure, nothin' like that. My wife… well, she had some things, but she passed away a couple years back, so… that’s a whole other story. I don’t take any regular medication.
DOCTOR: I’m very sorry to hear about your wife. That must have been incredibly difficult. Okay, so no current medical conditions, no chronic illnesses, no medications. And you haven’t had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No surgeries. Just the broken arm when I was a little kid. They just set it in a cast, healed up okay. I’m pretty good with gettin' banged up at work, scrapes and bruises mostly. But nothin’ that ever needed a doctor or a hospital. I try to avoid those places if I can.
DOCTOR: Understood. No significant surgical history. Now, thinking about your family—are there any medical conditions that run in your family—anything like muscle weakness, balance problems, neurological issues, or anything else that might be relevant?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a tough one. My mom’s side… they mostly had heart trouble. My dad's side… I don't know as much about. He wasn't around much. He worked on the pipelines. A lot of them had… problems with their backs, from the work, I think. And a couple of my uncles… I remember hearin' somethin' about them gettin' shaky when they got older, but I never really knew what it was. Just… old age stuff, I figured. It wasn’t somethin' they talked about much. I don't think it was anything serious.
DOCTOR: Okay, a family history of heart trouble on your mother’s side, back problems related to pipeline work, and some mention of shakiness in older relatives. That’s helpful. Now, just a few more questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Nah, nothin' like that. Never smoked a day in my life. I'll have a beer with dinner sometimes, but that’s about it. And no, definitely no drugs. I gotta be clear-headed for work. It's dangerous enough out there as it is.
DOCTOR: Good to know. So, no smoking, minimal alcohol consumption, no drug use. Alright, Mr. Fratoni, thank you for answering all those questions. It gives me a good starting point. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical exam, if you don’t mind. I’ll check your strength, reflexes, and balance, and listen to your heart and lungs. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds good, Doc. Whatever ya need to do. I trust your judgment. Just let me know if somethin' hurts or feels weird. I'm ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you could please sit here on the examination table, that would be great. I'm going to start by checking your vital signs - your blood pressure, pulse and temperature. Then we’ll move on to the neurological exam. Okay, your vital signs are within normal limits. Now, I’m going to check your strength in your arms and legs. Could you please squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: Yeah, no problem. There ya go. Is that okay? I’m tryin’ not to break ya hands, Doc.
DOCTOR: Excellent grip strength. And thank you for being mindful of my hands! Now, let's check your legs. Could you please try to push your feet against my hands like you're pressing on a gas pedal?
PATIENT: Sure thing. Like this? I'm pushin' as hard as I can, Doc. Is that good?
DOCTOR: That’s good, very good. Strength is 5/5 bilaterally in both legs. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes. I'm going to gently tap on your tendons with this small hammer. This is perfectly normal, but let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. Your reflexes are normal and symmetrical. Now, I’m going to assess your balance. Could you please stand with your feet together, and close your eyes?
PATIENT: Okay, no problem. Hold on a sec… I’m standin’ pretty steady, Doc. Just a little wobbly, maybe? It's kinda hard to stand with your eyes closed.
DOCTOR: You're right, it is harder with your eyes closed. I noticed a little unsteadiness, but you recovered quickly. Okay, now could you please walk a few steps forward and then backward?
PATIENT: Okay, did a few steps forward… and now back. Is that alright? Felt a little awkward walkin' back there, but I think I managed okay. It's kinda hard to walk in a straight line, ya know?
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly normal to feel a little awkward. I did notice a slight unsteadiness and a mild widening of your base. Okay, last part of the physical exam. I'm just going to feel around your legs to check for any tenderness or swelling. Alright, Mr. Fratoni, that completes the physical exam. Everything appears generally normal, although I did note some mild unsteadiness with your balance and gait.
PATIENT: Okay, good. So, what does all that mean, Doc? Is it somethin' serious? I gotta get back to work, ya know. Can't be sittin' around too long.
DOCTOR: That’s a fair question, and I understand your concern about getting back to work. Based on your history and the physical exam, the mild unsteadiness and difficulty with balance, along with the gradual onset of difficulty rising from chairs, could suggest a few possibilities. It could be related to mild weakness in your legs, potentially due to a vitamin deficiency or early signs of neuropathy. It could also be a sign of a problem with your inner ear, affecting your balance. Another possibility, given your age and symptoms, would be something called orthostatic hypotension, where your blood pressure drops slightly when you stand up, causing dizziness and unsteadiness. However, to get a clearer picture, I’d like to order some blood tests to check your vitamin levels, kidney function, and rule out any underlying inflammation. I’d also recommend a basic neurological assessment and potentially a balance test to evaluate your inner ear function. Would you be comfortable with those tests?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds… thorough. I guess. I mean, I don't want to be runnin' around gettin' a bunch of tests, but I also don't want somethin' serious gettin' worse. Vitamin deficiency sounds… easy enough to fix, I guess. Neurological assessment… that sounds kinda scary. But if ya think it's important, I trust ya. Balance test… never had one of those before. Okay, yeah, let's do the tests. What do I gotta do? And how long will it take to get the results? I really need to know if I can go back to work or not.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I’m glad we’re on the same page. The blood tests are fairly straightforward. You’ll just need to go to the lab – I’ll give you a requisition form. They’ll draw a small sample of blood, and it usually takes about 15-20 minutes. The neurological assessment will be conducted by a neurologist. They’ll assess your reflexes, muscle strength, coordination, and sensation. It’s a non-invasive exam, and it will give us more detailed information about your nervous system. I’ll give you a referral to Dr. Evelyn Reed – she’s excellent. The balance test is also non-invasive. It involves standing on a platform while sensors measure your balance. It's performed by a physical therapist specializing in vestibular rehabilitation. I'll give you a referral to the physical therapy department at Suburban General. As for the results, the blood tests usually take 2-3 business days to come back. The neurological assessment and balance test may take a little longer, depending on Dr. Reed's and the physical therapist's schedules. I'll follow up with you as soon as I have all the results, and we can discuss the next steps. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding any strenuous activity until we have a clearer diagnosis. And please, if you experience any sudden dizziness, weakness, or loss of coordination, go to the emergency room immediately. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds… a lot. But reasonable, I guess. Okay, blood tests, neurologist, balance test. And no heavy liftin’… alright. I can do that. I'll try to take it easy. Just… what if it’s somethin’ bad? Like… somethin’ I can’t fix? I gotta provide for my family, ya know. I don't have a lotta savings. I'll get those forms, I guess. And I'll call Dr. Reed and the physical therapist. What's their numbers?
DOCTOR: It’s completely understandable to be concerned about the possibility of something serious, and it’s good you’re voicing those anxieties. While we need to investigate to get a clear picture, it’s important to remember that many of the possibilities we’re considering are treatable. Even if it is something more complex, there are often ways to manage the symptoms and maintain a good quality of life. We’ll address this together, one step at a time, and I’ll make sure you have access to the resources you need. Here are the numbers and addresses for Dr. Reed and the physical therapy department: Dr. Evelyn Reed, Neurologist: Phone: 123-4567 Address: 123 Main Street, Suite 200, Suburban, State Suburban General Physical Therapy Department: Phone: 987-6543 Address: 456 Oak Avenue, Suburban, State I’m also providing you with a list of local resources that can help with financial assistance and healthcare access. Here are the requisitions for the blood tests. Please take these to the lab at Suburban General, and they'll handle the rest. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Nah, I think that's all for now, Doc. A lotta information to take in. Thanks for explainin’ everything so clearly, and for the numbers and stuff. I appreciate it. I'll get these tests done and call Dr. Reed. Hopefully, it's just a vitamin deficiency. That'd be the best-case scenario. Alright, I guess I'll see ya in a few days, once the results are back. Thanks again, Doc. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Fratoni. Please don’t hesitate to call my office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. I understand this can be stressful, and I’m here to support you every step of the way. I wish you all the best, and I look forward to discussing the results with you soon. Have a good day, and please take care of yourself.
