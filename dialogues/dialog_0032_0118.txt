DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Oriley. I am Dr. Pipkorn. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. Pipkorn, you say? Yes, well. It’s… a certification, I believe. Something about needing to be re-certified for… my work. It’s all rather tedious, honestly. I don’t recall the specifics. Something to do with my ears, or perhaps my eyes. One of the two. I do hope this won’t take too long.
DOCTOR: Yes, well, these certifications are important for ensuring continued competency, Mr. Oriley. To clarify, are you here for a general physical to fulfill a requirement, or are you experiencing a specific issue with your vision or your hearing?
PATIENT: Competency… yes, yes, I’m quite competent, thank you. I’ve been doing this a long time. Honestly, I don’t feel like I have an issue with either one. It’s just… paperwork. And the insurance company, no doubt. They always need something. I suppose… they told me to come in for an exam. A check-up, if you will. Is that sufficient? Really, I haven't noticed anything being… off.
DOCTOR: Very well. While you state you haven’t noticed any issues, a comprehensive assessment is still necessary to satisfy the certification requirements and ensure there are no underlying concerns. We wouldn’t want any potential problems to go undetected. Let’s begin with a review of your medical history. Do you have any pre-existing medical conditions—diabetes, hypertension, heart disease, anything like that?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Medical history… That's a rather broad question, isn't it? I’ve lived a long life, Doctor. I've had the usual bumps and bruises, I suppose. Nothing… serious, as far as I recall. I had a bit of trouble with my back a few years ago, but that’s been sorted. And… a touch of indigestion sometimes. Is that what you’re looking for? No diabetes, no… hypertension, as you say. I try to eat a sensible diet. Though my ex-wife always said otherwise. Really, I don’t believe I’ve had anything major.
DOCTOR: “A touch of indigestion” is not particularly helpful, Mr. Oriley. We need specifics. When did this indigestion start?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Must we dwell on my digestive system? It comes and goes, Doctor. It’s not a constant affliction. Perhaps after a particularly rich meal. Or if I’ve had a bit too much coffee. It’s been happening… well, for years. Honestly, I can’t put a precise date on it. It's just… something I live with. I assure you, it doesn't impede my work in any way. It’s simply a minor inconvenience. Is this truly relevant to the certification? I feel as though we’re getting rather sidetracked.
DOCTOR: Mr. Oriley, while I understand your frustration, a complete medical history is essential. Even seemingly minor symptoms can provide valuable insight. Let’s move on from the indigestion for now. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… hmm. Let me think. There was… something when I was quite young. A tonsillectomy, I believe. A rather unpleasant experience, as I recall. And… ah, yes! A minor procedure on my knee, decades ago. A sports injury. Nothing serious. Just a torn meniscus, I think. And… that's all I can readily recall. Though, to be perfectly honest, my memory isn't what it used to be. I may be forgetting something. It was a long time ago, you see. A very long time. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: And your family history, Mr. Oriley?
PATIENT: Family history… Now that's a difficult one. My father… he was a strong man. Lived to a good age, I believe. Worked in the shipping industry. Mother, bless her soul, was a homemaker. I had a sister, but we… haven't spoken in years. As for illnesses… I honestly don’t recall anyone suffering from anything particularly significant. Perhaps a bit of arthritis in my aunt. But nothing major. Heart disease, cancer… no, I don’t believe so. We weren’t a family that discussed such things openly, you see. It wasn’t considered proper. Is that sufficient? Really, I'm not a particularly medical family.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, let’s discuss your current medications. Are you taking anything at all, prescribed or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: Medications… hmm. Let me see. I take a small dose of something for my… well, for my joints. Just to keep them moving, you see. A little ache here and there. And sometimes, if I’m having trouble sleeping, I’ll take… a sleeping pill. Just one. Nothing regular, mind you. Only when absolutely necessary. And occasionally, an antacid. For the indigestion, of course. But other than that… no, nothing. I try to avoid taking pills whenever possible. I don't like the way they make me feel. Is that all you need to know? I’m starting to feel rather… bombarded with questions, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Could you please tell me the names of these medications, Mr. Oriley?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Names… Now you're asking something. I simply ask my pharmacist for them, you see. I don't bother with the specifics. It's all rather technical, and frankly, unimportant. I believe the one for my joints is… something with a 'glo' in the name? Glucosamine, perhaps? And the sleeping pill… a small blue one. As for the antacid… it's just a standard over-the-counter brand. You know, the kind you get at any pharmacy. I’m afraid I’m not very good with names, Doctor. I leave the details to the professionals. It's all rather… overwhelming.
DOCTOR: Mr. Oriley, with all due respect, your lack of specific information is making this examination…difficult. We need to know exactly what you are taking to avoid potential drug interactions or adverse effects. I’m going to need you to contact your pharmacy and obtain a list of all your current medications. Do you have a way to do that, or would you like me to have my nurse assist you?
PATIENT: Oh, honestly. This is becoming rather absurd. A list… I suppose I can ask my pharmacist. Though I fail to see why it’s so vital. I’ve been taking these things for years with no ill effects. But very well, I’ll contact them. It’s a nuisance, of course, but I suppose I must. My nurse, you say? Yes, that would be… helpful. I’m not very good with these modern contraptions. It's all rather… technological. I appreciate your assistance, Doctor. Though I still maintain this is all rather unnecessary. .
DOCTOR: Very well. While we wait for that information, let’s proceed with a brief physical examination. Please have a seat on the examination table. We’ll start with your ears.
