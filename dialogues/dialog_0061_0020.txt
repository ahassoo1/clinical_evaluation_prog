DOCTOR: Talofa, Avril! It's lovely to meet you. I'm Dr. Kimm. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good day, Doctor Kimm. It is nice to meet you too. Well, I am here for this… telephone visit. My son, he make the appointment for me. I not always feel so good, and he says I need to talk to a doctor.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's perfectly alright. It's good your son is looking out for you. A telephone visit… so, it sounds like there are some general health concerns he wanted me to check out. Can you tell me a little more about what hasn’t been feeling so good?
PATIENT: Yes, my son, Tomas, he is very good boy. Always worry about his mama. Hmm… what not feeling good… it is hard to say exactly. Just… tired. And my back, it aches a lot. Especially when I am working. I am mechanic, you know? Work with cars. It is hard work. But I have done this for many years.
DOCTOR: Okay, so tiredness and back pain, especially with work. That gives me a good starting point. When did you start noticing this tiredness?
PATIENT: Oh… when did it start? That is a good question. It is… slow, you know? Not one day. Maybe… six months ago? It just got more and more. I thought it was just getting old. But Tomas, he say no. A doctor need to look.
DOCTOR: Alright, six months of gradually increasing tiredness. That’s helpful. And you said the back pain is worse with work – is it a constant pain, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It come and go. When I am not working, it is… not so bad. Just a little ache. But when I lift the cars, or bend over, it is… sharp. And then it stay for a little while. Even after I stop working. It is not good.
DOCTOR: Okay, so sharp pain with lifting and bending, and lingering discomfort afterwards. Have you noticed any pain radiating down your legs, or any numbness or tingling in your legs or feet?
PATIENT: No, no numbness. And no pain down the legs. Just in my back. Sometimes, it feels like… a knot? In the muscles. A very tight knot. Tomas, he try to rub it, but it not help much. He is good boy, but not a doctor!
DOCTOR: Alright, a tight knot in your lower back, that’s good to know. Have you tried any other treatments for the pain – like heat or ice, or over-the-counter pain relievers?
PATIENT: Yes, I try. Tomas, he give me some pills. White pills. For the pain. They help a little, maybe. But I do not like to take too many pills. And I try the warm bath. That feel good for a little while, but then the pain come back. I use a warm towel sometimes, on my back. But nothing really… fix it.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you've tried over-the-counter pain relievers and warm compresses with some temporary relief. Do you have any other symptoms – like fever, chills, weight loss, or any problems with your bladder or bowels?
PATIENT: No fever. No chills. I maybe lose a little weight, but I not sure. I eat less when I am tired, maybe that is why. And no problems with… how you say? The bathroom. Everything is… normal there. I am old lady, things change sometimes, but not now.
DOCTOR: Alright, no fever, chills, bowel or bladder issues, and possibly some weight loss related to decreased appetite. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your past health. Do you have any medical conditions that you've been diagnosed with before – like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. The doctor, many years ago, he say my blood pressure was a little high. He gave me some pills for that too. But I stopped taking them. I did not like the way they made me feel. I have no… what you call it? Sugar problem. No heart trouble. Just the blood pressure. And… my hip. I had a new hip put in, maybe ten years ago. It is good now.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of high blood pressure in the past, and a hip replacement ten years ago. And you're currently not taking any medication for the blood pressure. Have you had any surgeries other than the hip replacement?
PATIENT: No, just the hip. I have broken bones, when I was little girl. But that was long time ago. Nothing they have to fix with… with knife. Just bandages and cast. My Tomas, he always say I am tough. Old Czech woman, very strong! But sometimes even strong women need a doctor.
DOCTOR: Alright, no other surgeries. And you've been told you're tough by your son! That's good to know. Now, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies. I eat everything. Czech food, Fijian food… I like food! And I not allergic to… what you call it? Flowers? Bees? No. Never have been. My mama, she was allergic to cats, but I am fine with cats. Except, I do not like cats very much. They scratch! But not an allergy.
DOCTOR: Okay, no allergies. And you're not a fan of cats! Alright, last question about your history for now. Is there anyone in your family – parents, siblings, or children – who has had similar problems with back pain, or any other significant medical conditions?
PATIENT: Hmm… my mama, she had a bad back when she was old. But she worked very hard, in the fields. It was different kind of pain, I think. And my papa, he had… heart trouble. Very serious. He died when he was young. Tomas, he worry about his heart, too. He is very careful about what he eats. No one else, I think. Just my mama's back, and my papa’s heart.
DOCTOR: Okay, so your mother had back pain from hard work, and your father had heart trouble. That’s helpful. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam to get a better idea of what's going on with your back. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that is good. I am ready for exam. What do you need me to do? I am a little stiff, maybe. But I can move. I just not bend so good.
DOCTOR: Alright, great. First, could you please stand for me?
PATIENT: Okay, I am standing. Be careful, Doctor. I am not so young anymore!
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you. I’m just looking at how you stand and move. I notice a slight rounding of your shoulders, and you seem to be favoring your left side a little bit when you stand. Now, I’m going to gently feel your back to check for tenderness or any muscle knots. Can you tell me if you feel any pain when I press here?
PATIENT: Ouch! Yes, that is sore. Right there. And… a little bit higher up. That feels like… a knot. A very tight knot. Like you said. Tomas try to rub it, but he not strong enough! It is deep inside.
DOCTOR: Okay, I feel a definite muscle knot there, and there's some tenderness. Now, I'm going to ask you to gently bend forward, backward, and side to side. Just go as far as you comfortably can. Don’t push yourself. Tell me if you feel any sharp pain. Let's start with bending forward.
PATIENT: Ooh… that is hard. I cannot go so far. It hurts in my lower back. And… my legs are getting tired. I am not so flexible anymore! That is hard, Doctor. Very hard.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you. That gives me a good idea. Now, let's try bending to the side. Just gently lean to each side, as far as you comfortably can. And then, let's try twisting gently from side to side. Again, stop if you feel any sharp pain. Let's start by leaning to your right.
PATIENT: Ooh… that is better. But still… a little bit sore. Not so bad. Okay, that is enough for right side. Now… left side. Left side… is harder. Very hard. I feel a pull. Yes, that is enough. Left side is much more painful.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you. And finally, I'm going to quickly check your reflexes and sensation in your legs. This just helps me make sure there's no nerve involvement. Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally, which is normal. Sensation to light touch is intact in both legs. No numbness or tingling noted. So, overall, your exam shows tenderness and muscle spasm in your lower back, limited range of motion, especially to the left, but normal reflexes and sensation. Based on your history and the exam, it sounds like you likely have a muscle strain, possibly with some facet joint irritation. This is common with work like yours.
PATIENT: Muscle strain? Facet… what? Is that bad? I do not understand all these words. Does that mean I need… a knife? Or more pills? And can I still work? Tomas will be very worried if I cannot work!
DOCTOR: No, no knife needed at all! And we'll try to avoid a lot of pills if we can. A muscle strain just means you've overstretched or slightly damaged a muscle in your back. The facet joints are small joints in your spine that can become irritated when you strain your back, causing pain. It's not serious, but it can be uncomfortable. As for working, we need to be careful. Continuing to lift and bend while it's strained could make it worse and delay healing. I recommend taking a break from heavy lifting for a week or two. We can discuss modified duties – maybe lighter work that doesn’t involve so much bending and lifting. I'm going to recommend some over-the-counter pain reliever like ibuprofen or naproxen to help with the pain and inflammation. Also, gentle stretching and heat applications can be helpful. I’ll give you a handout with some exercises you can try. Do you have any questions about that so far?
PATIENT: Ibuprofen? I think Tomas gave me that before. Okay. And heat… yes, I like warm bath. A week or two? That is long time. My job… it is hard. Handout? You mean… paper with pictures? I hope they are easy to understand. My eyesight is not so good. And what if… what if it does not get better? What if I need more help?
DOCTOR: Yes, a week or two can be tough, I understand. We’ll see how you’re doing and can adjust things if needed. The handout will have pictures, and I can print a larger version for you if your eyesight is a concern. No problem at all. And if it doesn’t get better, that’s when we talk about “more help.” That could mean physical therapy, or in rare cases, imaging – like an X-ray – to rule out anything more serious. But let’s start with this plan – rest, pain relief, and gentle stretching – and see how you respond. I’m also going to write a note to your primary care doctor about this visit, just so they're aware of what's going on. And if you experience any new symptoms – like numbness, tingling, weakness in your legs, or problems with bladder or bowel control – please contact me immediately. Those could be signs of something more serious. Do you have any other questions for me right now?
PATIENT: Okay… pictures are small. Maybe Tomas can help me. And you write to my doctor? That is good. He is very busy, he doesn't always have time. Um… how often should I take the ibuprofen? And can I still… drive? I need to drive to work, even if I take it easy. And what if the pain is very bad at night? Will that mean something is wrong?
DOCTOR: Yes, let's get those questions answered. Tomas can definitely help you with the handout. And I’ll make sure the note to your doctor is very clear. For the ibuprofen, you can take 200-400mg every 4-6 hours as needed for pain, but don't exceed 1200mg in a day. It’s best to take it with food to protect your stomach. You can still drive, as long as the pain isn’t severe enough to affect your ability to concentrate and control the vehicle. If it's causing you significant discomfort, it's best to have someone else drive. And if the pain is very bad at night, that could mean something is going on. It doesn't necessarily mean anything is seriously wrong, but it’s a good idea to let me know. It might mean you need a slightly different approach to pain management. We'll take things one step at a time. Let's try this plan for a week, and we can reassess then. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes… one step at a time. That sounds good. Tomas will help me with the pills and the pictures. And I will… try not to lift too much. I have many years of lifting, it is hard to stop. Thank you, Doctor Kimm. You explain very clearly. And you are very patient with old woman. I think… that is all my questions for now. But I may call if I remember something else.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Avril. It was my pleasure. And please, don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions at all. That’s what I’m here for. And don't worry about being an "old woman," you’re a strong woman who's been working hard for many years. We’ll get this sorted out together. Take care, and I’ll see you in a week if you need it. Have a good day, and please tell Tomas I said hello!
