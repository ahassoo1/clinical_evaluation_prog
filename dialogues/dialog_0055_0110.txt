DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. McNabb. I am Dr. Eaddy. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, could you tell me in your own words what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s very nice to meet you as well. Well, to put it plainly, I feel… a little worn out. Not sick, exactly, but not as spry as I used to be. I suppose you could say I'm looking for a bit of a… reset. A jumpstart, maybe? I’m 87 years old, you see, and things just aren’t working quite as smoothly as they once did. I’d like to feel more like myself again, if you understand.
DOCTOR: I understand perfectly, Ms. McNabb. It’s quite common to experience changes as we age. “Worn out” is a good description. Could you elaborate a bit on what that feels like, specifically?
PATIENT: Well, it’s not one thing, you see. It’s… everything takes a little more effort. Getting up from a chair, for instance. Or walking up the slight incline to my mailbox. Nothing that stops me, mind you. I still manage, thank goodness. But it’s… noticeable. And my energy levels aren’t what they used to be. I used to be able to garden all day, but now… a little weeding and I need a good nap. Does that make sense? It’s a gradual thing, not a sudden collapse.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Ms. McNabb. A gradual decline in energy and increased effort with everyday activities. That is… not uncommon. Let's try to get a better picture of this. Are you experiencing any pain with these activities, or is it more just… fatigue?
PATIENT: Hmm. That’s a good question. Not pain, exactly. Sometimes a little stiffness in my knees, especially in the mornings. But not a sharp pain, if you understand. Mostly it’s just… tired muscles. And a little breathlessness if I push myself too hard. It’s hard to explain. It's not like anything is broken, it just... feels old, I suppose. Is that silly to say?
DOCTOR: Not silly at all, Ms. McNabb. It's perfectly valid to describe your symptoms that way. “Feels old” is… a very descriptive phrase. Let's delve a little deeper into this breathlessness. When you say “push yourself too hard,” could you give me an example of what that entails?
PATIENT: Well, like if I’m trying to carry groceries inside from the car. Or, you know, if my grandchildren want me to play tag with them – which I love to do, don’t misunderstand. But after a little running around, I get a bit winded. It doesn’t last long, mind you. Just a few minutes to catch my breath and I’m alright. But it wasn’t always like this. I used to be able to keep up with them just fine. And I live on the second floor, so the stairs… they used to be no problem at all. Now, I take them slower. A lot slower.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any swelling in your ankles or feet at the end of the day?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, sometimes. Not every day, mind you. But if it’s been a particularly warm day, or if I’ve been on my feet a lot, my ankles will get a little puffy. I usually put my feet up for a bit and it goes down. I thought it was just… part of getting older, to be honest. I haven’t really thought much of it. Is that something I should be concerned about?
DOCTOR: It's good you mention that, Ms. McNabb. Swelling can be related to several things, and it’s helpful to know. Let’s move on to some other questions. Do you have any history of heart problems, high blood pressure, or diabetes?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think. My husband, God rest his soul, he had high blood pressure towards the end. But I haven’t been diagnosed with anything, not that I know of. The doctors always said my heart was strong. I had regular check-ups, you see. And no, no diabetes. I try to eat a healthy diet. Mostly fish and vegetables, and I don’t drink much soda. I used to be a very active swimmer when I was younger. Perhaps that helped. Do you need me to remember the name of my previous doctor? I sometimes… forget things, you know.
DOCTOR: No need to strain yourself with names, Ms. McNabb. We can access your records. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. When I was quite young, I had my tonsils out. And, let me see… when I broke my wrist when I was a teenager, riding my bicycle. Other than that, not much. No major hospital stays, thank goodness. Just the usual doctor’s visits for colds and flu. I’ve always been a pretty healthy person, all things considered. I do worry about my memory, though. It’s not what it used to be. Is that normal at my age?
DOCTOR: It is common to experience some memory changes with age, Ms. McNabb. But we’ll keep that in mind as we discuss your overall health. Now, can you tell me about your family history?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s a long story. My mother lived to be 95, a very strong woman. She had arthritis, mostly. My father died of a heart attack when he was in his 60s. And my older brother had high blood pressure, like your chart says. Most of my family on both sides lived to a good old age, thankfully. Strong stock, I suppose. Though, a few of them struggled with… what do you call it… the sugar sickness? Diabetes, I think. My auntie had it very badly. I worry I might have inherited that, even though I haven’t been diagnosed. It runs in the family, you know. Is that something you can test for?
DOCTOR: Yes, we can certainly test for diabetes, Ms. McNabb. And it's good to know about your family history. Finally, let’s talk a bit about your current medications, if any, and any allergies you have.
PATIENT: Well, I take a small pill for my arthritis every morning. It helps with the stiffness, but it doesn’t cure it, mind you. And I take a daily vitamin, just a general one. That's about it! As for allergies... I don't think I have any major allergies. I’m a little sensitive to certain perfumes, they give me a headache, but that’s not really an allergy, is it? I've never had a bad reaction to any medications, thankfully. I’m very careful about what I put into my body. You can never be too careful, you know.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. McNabb. Thank you for providing me with such a thorough history. Now, I'd like to perform a brief physical exam to get a better understanding of what’s going on. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that would be perfectly alright, Doctor. I'm ready whenever you are. I trust your judgment, and I'm happy to do whatever you think is necessary. Just let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. I'm not as spry as I used to be, you know, so I might need a little assistance getting up and down.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you'll just have a seat here, we'll start with your blood pressure and pulse. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, 148 over 85. Your pulse is 72, regular. Now, let's listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds are a bit faint, but no murmurs noted. Lungs are clear, but slightly diminished breath sounds bilaterally. Abdomen is soft, non-tender. Mild pitting edema in both ankles. Now, can you stand up for me?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. There we go. A little wobbly, but I'm alright. That’s probably the swelling, isn’t it? Everything feels a little heavier these days. You said my heart sounds were faint? Is that something to be worried about? I always thought my heart was strong. I used to swim miles and miles when I was a girl. This is all a little unsettling, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Just a little support, Ms. McNabb. Your heart sounds being faint can be normal, especially with age, but it's something we'll want to investigate further. Now, let’s check your reflexes. Reflexes are a little diminished, but within normal limits for your age. And finally, I'm going to do a quick gait assessment, just to see how you walk. If you could just walk a few steps for me, that would be helpful. Your gait is a little slow, and you have a slightly wide-based stance. Alright, Ms. McNabb, please sit back down. That completes the physical exam for now. Based on what you've told me and the exam findings, I'd like to order a few tests to get a clearer picture of what's going on.
PATIENT: Oh, alright. That sounds sensible, Doctor. A thorough check-up is always a good idea. What sort of tests are you thinking of? Blood work? And a chest X-ray, perhaps? I'm happy to do whatever you need. I just want to feel like myself again, you see. This feeling of… being worn out is rather disheartening. I used to be so active, and now… well, now I'm mostly tired. It’s a little frightening, to be honest. I just want to make sure everything is alright. Are these tests expensive? I have private insurance, but… you know. I worry about the costs.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. McNabb. We'll start with a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, a thyroid-stimulating hormone test, and an EKG to check your heart’s electrical activity. And yes, a chest X-ray is a good idea. These tests will help us assess your overall health, check for any underlying conditions, and rule out any serious problems. As for the cost, I'll have my staff check your insurance coverage and give you an estimate before we proceed. We’ll make sure you’re aware of all the costs involved before anything is done. We’ll also want to rule out anemia, as that can cause fatigue. I'm also concerned about possible mild heart failure given the diminished breath sounds and swelling in your ankles. It’s important to investigate these things thoroughly. Do you have any allergies to contrast dye?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Contrast dye? I don't think so. I've never had any tests with dye before, to my knowledge. I've always been a bit of a scaredy-cat when it comes to medical procedures, so I usually avoid anything too complicated. I've just had the usual check-ups and vaccinations, you see. I don't recall ever having anything with dye. I'm a little nervous just thinking about it! But if you think it's necessary, Doctor, I trust your judgment. I just hope it's not too painful. And I hope it doesn't take too long. I have my grandchildren coming to visit next week, and I wouldn't want to miss that. They’re the light of my life, you see. Is there anything I need to do to prepare for these tests? A special diet, or anything like that?
DOCTOR: No, nothing special is required to prepare for these tests, Ms. McNabb. The blood work requires a simple fast overnight, we'll provide you with those instructions when we schedule it. The chest X-ray and EKG are painless and non-invasive. As for the dye, we won’t use it unless absolutely necessary. It's a precaution, just to be thorough. My staff will schedule these tests for you and answer any questions you may have. In the meantime, I want to emphasize that we are taking all of this very seriously. We'll get to the bottom of what’s causing your fatigue and develop a plan to help you feel like yourself again. We are not going to rush into anything. It's important to remember that many things can cause fatigue, and it’s often treatable. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so, Doctor. You've been very thorough and reassuring. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me and explain everything so clearly. I feel much better knowing that we are going to investigate this properly. My grandchildren are coming on Thursday, so… hopefully, we’ll have some results by then. Even if it's just a little something. It would be nice to know what I'm dealing with. Thank you again for your kindness and patience. I really appreciate it. And please, let me know if you need any more information from me. I'll do my best to remember anything I can.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. McNabb. We’ll do our best to get those results to you as quickly as possible. My staff will be in touch to schedule the tests and answer any questions you may have. In the meantime, try to get some rest and stay hydrated. And don't hesitate to call if you experience any new or worsening symptoms. It was a pleasure meeting you today.
PATIENT: .
