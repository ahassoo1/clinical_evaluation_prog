DOCTOR: Right. Terasa Mayhugh, 59. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello doctor. It’s… well, my ears. They’ve been playing up again. Sort of a swooshing sound, and then… everything spins. It doesn’t last long, but it’s quite unsettling. My daughter, Lani, she insisted I come. Said it's been happening more often. Honestly, I can't really remember when it started, exactly. It feels like it’s been on and off for… a while now.
DOCTOR: Right. “Swooshing” and dizziness. “On and off for a while.” That's… helpful. Look, I haven't got all day, alright?
PATIENT: Oh, I'm sorry, doctor. I just… my memory isn’t what it used to be, you see. Lani says my father had something similar, with his ears. But I don’t… I don’t recall the details. Is that alright? I’ll try to be more… specific. Just give me a moment.
DOCTOR: Your father had it. Wonderful. Look, family history is good, but your symptoms are what I need. When does this “swooshing” happen?
PATIENT: Oh, um… it’s hard to say. Not when I’m doing anything special, I don't think. Sometimes when I’m just sitting… or maybe when I turn my head quickly? It’s all a bit of a blur, honestly. It's not constant, thankfully. And it's not painful, if that helps. Just… disorienting. It makes me a bit shaky, and I have to sit down.
DOCTOR: Alright, no pain. Shaky when it happens. And it's positional… sometimes?
PATIENT: Yes, I think so. When I move my head, sometimes it feels worse. Not always, but… often. Lani says I should mention I’m a bit hard of hearing anyway. It’s just… getting older, I suppose. I don’t pay it much mind, usually. It's never bothered me too much.
DOCTOR: Hard of hearing. Of course. Let’s just get this over with. I'm going to take a look in your ears. Sit still, alright?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Yes, of course. Sit still… I can do that. Just… please be gentle? I don’t like things poking around in there.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Tympanic membranes are a bit dull. Some cerumen buildup… nothing dramatic. External canals appear clear. Alright. Now, I want you to follow my finger with your eyes. Don’t move your head. Left, right, up, down… good. Any dizziness during that?
PATIENT: No, no dizziness during that. Just… a little strange, following your finger. I’m a bit clumsy, you see. No spinning or anything like that. It's like… when I try to focus on something small. It's hard to explain. Is that… bad?
DOCTOR: Alright, no nystagmus. Look, this is likely just age-related inner ear issues exacerbated by the cerumen. It’s not… life-threatening, alright?
PATIENT: Oh, good. Not… life-threatening. That's a relief. So… what does that mean exactly? Do I need… medicine? Will it get worse? I just… I don't want to fall.
DOCTOR: It means your balance system is a bit… off. We'll try some cerumen removal first. And I'll give you some meclizine for the dizziness. But honestly, it's probably just something you'll have to live with. You're not getting any younger. I’ll write you a prescription. And try to be careful, alright?
PATIENT: Oh. I see. Just… careful. Alright. Thank you, doctor. Is the… meclizine, will that make me sleepy? I like to play bingo with Lani on Thursdays. I wouldn't want to miss that.
DOCTOR: It can cause drowsiness. Take it at night. If you feel too sleepy, don’t take it before bingo. Honestly, it’s probably a mild side effect. Next! Do you have any other questions, or are we finished here?
PATIENT: Oh… alright. At night, then. Yes, that’s… good. No, I think that's all. Thank you, doctor. You've been very… helpful.
DOCTOR: Right. Good. Get a checkup in six months. And be careful, alright?
PATIENT: Yes, six months. I will. Thank you again. .
