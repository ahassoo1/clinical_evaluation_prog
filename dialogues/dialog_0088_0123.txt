DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Cassimatis. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Piet. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. It's nice to meet you too. Well, my skin… it's been so itchy lately. Just driving me crazy, really. It's all over, not just one spot.
DOCTOR: Okay, itchy skin all over. And how long has this been going on?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… maybe a couple of weeks now? It started small, I thought it was just dry skin, you know? But it’s gotten worse, and lotion doesn’t seem to help much anymore. It's particularly bad at night, keeps me up sometimes.
DOCTOR: A couple of weeks, worse at night…and lotion isn't providing relief. Alright. Have you noticed any changes in your skin besides the itching?
PATIENT: Hmm… besides the itch? Let me think… I don't think so. No rash, no bumps, no redness really. It just… feels itchy. My skin feels a little dry, but it doesn’t look that bad, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Okay, no visible rash, bumps, or redness… just the sensation of itchiness and some dryness. And has anything changed recently that might be causing this?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me see… nothing major. I started using a new laundry detergent, maybe a month ago? A new brand, thought I’d try it. Other than that… I haven’t really changed anything. I've been eating the same things, same soaps… Honestly, Doctor, I'm a pretty simple woman.
DOCTOR: New laundry detergent… okay. And could you tell me a little bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: Oh, well, I’ve been pretty healthy, all things considered. I had the usual childhood illnesses, nothing serious. I had my gallbladder out years ago, maybe twenty years ago? And… well, I'm divorced, if that’s what you mean. Nothing else too much to speak of, really. No allergies that I know of.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies, gallbladder removal twenty years ago. Do you take any medications regularly, Ms. Cassimatis?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don't. I try to avoid them if I can. I believe in letting my body do its own healing, you know? Just a little bit of arthritis in my hands, but I manage with over-the-counter pain relievers when it flares up. Nothing daily.
DOCTOR: Okay, no regular medications, just occasional over-the-counter pain relievers for arthritis. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam if that’s alright. It'll just involve looking at your skin more closely. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s perfectly alright, Doctor. Go right ahead. I’m happy to do whatever you think will help. I just want this itching to stop.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s take a look. Please go ahead and lift up your sleeves and loosen your collar a bit if you can. Hmm… skin appears generally normal, no obvious rash or lesions. It's dry to the touch, as you mentioned. No visible excoriations at this time. I don’t see anything alarming, but let's check your back as well. Skin on the back also appears normal, some dryness noted. No significant findings. Okay.
PATIENT: That's good to hear it doesn’t look alarming, Doctor. It's just so… bothersome. You said dry skin? Is that all it is, then? Is there a cream you can prescribe?
DOCTOR: It's possible it's just dry skin exacerbated by something—perhaps the new detergent. However, persistent, widespread itching without a visible cause warrants further investigation. Before we prescribe anything, I want to rule out other possibilities. Have you noticed any fatigue, weight loss, or fever recently?
PATIENT: Oh, no fever, no weight loss. And I've been a little tired, maybe, but that’s just getting older, isn’t it? I feel tired easily these days. It’s probably just old age catching up with me, Doctor.
DOCTOR: It could be a number of things, Ms. Cassimatis, and fatigue is common at any age. Just to be thorough, I'd like to order a basic blood test. It’ll check your thyroid function and rule out any underlying conditions that could be causing the itchiness. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh. A blood test? Well, I don't love needles, but… if you think it’s necessary, I suppose. It's just that I don't have insurance, so I worry about the cost. How much does it usually run?
DOCTOR: I understand your concern about the cost, Ms. Cassimatis. Let me check the pricing for you. Okay, the basic panel will be around $75. We also have some assistance programs available, and I can have our billing department contact you to explore those options. We don't want the cost to prevent you from getting the care you need. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: $75… well, that’s… manageable, I suppose. Assistance programs would be wonderful, yes. I appreciate you looking into that. Alright, let’s go ahead with the blood test. It's better to know, I guess.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I'll write you a lab order, and you can go to the lab across the street. They take walk-ins, so you shouldn't have a long wait. Once we get the results back—usually within a few days—we’ll discuss them and decide on the best course of action. In the meantime, I recommend switching back to your old laundry detergent and using a fragrance-free, hypoallergenic moisturizer a couple of times a day. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds very good, Doctor. I'll switch back to my old detergent right away and get some moisturizer. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly. I feel a little better knowing we’re trying to figure this out.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Cassimatis. I'm glad I could help. Our billing department will be in touch about the assistance programs, and we’ll call you as soon as the lab results are available. If the itching gets significantly worse or you develop any new symptoms—like a rash, fever, or fatigue—please don’t hesitate to call the office right away. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything, Doctor. Thank you again for your time and kindness. It really means a lot. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to an old woman like me.
DOCTOR: It was my pleasure, Ms. Cassimatis. We're here to help. Have a good day, and please don’t hesitate to reach out if you need anything.
PATIENT: You too, Doctor. Thank you.
