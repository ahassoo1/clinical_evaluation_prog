DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Scobie, good to meet you. Though frankly, at your age, everyone's got something. So, let's get right to it. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Eh, hello Doctor Sink. Nice to meet you too. Well… I wanna know where my people come from. Like, a long, long time ago. My grandkids, they ask me… and I dunno what to tell ‘em. They got those… tests now, yeah? For your… DNA? I hear they can tell you.
DOCTOR: DNA tests… yes. A rather… trendy pursuit these days. Look, Mr. Scobie, with all due respect, this is a medical clinic. I treat illnesses, not… genealogy. While I understand your grandkids are curious, that’s really a matter for historical research, not internal medicine. However… … if you've been experiencing any physical symptoms – fatigue, unexplained weight loss, anything at all – that might be related to your… ancestral inquiries, then perhaps we can discuss it. Otherwise, I’m afraid I'm not the right person to ask.
PATIENT: Oh. No… no sickness. Just… curious. My grandkids, they talk about it. They got papers, from the internet… sayin' where they from. Different places. I wanna know my places. I feel… old, you know? And I want to tell them somethin' before… before I go. Is there… someone else here? Someone who does this DNA thing?
DOCTOR: Look, Mr. Scobie. I’ve got patients waiting. This clinic doesn’t offer genealogical services. I believe there are companies online that handle those sorts of tests, though I can’t vouch for their accuracy. Honestly, I’m surprised your grandkids haven’t already found one for you. Perhaps a local library could point you in the right direction?
PATIENT: Oh. Library… Yes. Maybe. I go to the library sometimes. For the… newspapers. But internet… my grandkids do that. I don't know much about it. Is it… safe, those internet tests? They don't take your money and then… not tell you anything?
DOCTOR: Honestly, Mr. Scobie, I have no idea if those internet tests are “safe.” It’s… the internet. There are reputable companies, and there are… less reputable ones. I strongly advise you have your grandchildren research them thoroughly before providing any personal information, let alone your DNA. Look, I really must get back to my patients. Is there anything medical I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: Okay… okay, I understand. No… no sickness. Just… wanted to ask about the test. My grandkids… they will look into it. Maybe. Thank you, Doctor Sink. You were very… helpful.
DOCTOR: Very well. If you develop any concerning symptoms – anything at all – please don’t hesitate to schedule an appointment. Otherwise… have a good day, Mr. Scobie. .
PATIENT: Okay. You too, Doctor. .
