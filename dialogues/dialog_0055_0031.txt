DOCTOR: Good morning, Miss Kreckel. I am Dr. Eaddy. Please, have a seat. Now, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. Well, my left leg is quite swollen, you see. It’s been… bothersome for a few days now. And the… the doctor at home told me it’s something to do with my heart, a sort of… irregular beat, I believe they called it. Atrial… something. It's been happening on and off for a while.
DOCTOR: Hmm. An irregular heartbeat, you say. And the swelling is… recent?
PATIENT: Yes, recent. It started… I think it was last week, maybe earlier. It’s definitely gotten worse the past few days, though. It’s mostly in my calf, I think. It’s… uncomfortable. It doesn't hurt exactly, more like a heavy ache. I’m not entirely sure what’s normal, to be honest.
DOCTOR: I see. And has this swelling been accompanied by any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… let me think. I’ve been a bit more… tired than usual, perhaps? But I’ve also been quite busy with marking papers. It’s difficult to say what’s the tiredness from. No chest pain, no shortness of breath, if that’s what you mean. And no fever, I don’t believe. Just the swelling and the… the funny beat in my chest sometimes.
DOCTOR: Alright. And you mentioned this 'funny beat'… can you describe it to me?
PATIENT: It's… hard to explain. It doesn't feel like a normal heartbeat. It’s like it's… rushing, and then pausing. Almost skipping a beat, but not quite. It's a strange sensation, and it makes me a little… breathless sometimes, just from the feeling of it. It doesn’t last long, usually just a few seconds, then it goes away. But it’s… unsettling.
DOCTOR: Unsettling, yes. Well, we shall see. Have you ever had anything like this before?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. The irregular beat, that is. Not the swelling. The doctor told me a while back that it’s… common, for someone my age. He gave me some information, but I'm afraid I don’t remember all the details. It comes and goes, as I said. Sometimes months between episodes, sometimes just a few days. The swelling is new, though. I’ve never had this happen before.
DOCTOR: Right. And do you have any family history of heart problems?
PATIENT: That's a good question. My… my grandfather, on my mother’s side, I believe he had some sort of… heart trouble. He was a very active man, though, always working on the farm. It was a long time ago, I don’t know the specifics. My mother said it was something to do with his blood pressure, perhaps? I don’t know if that’s… relevant. We weren’t very close, sadly.
DOCTOR: Hm. And do you take any medications currently, Miss Kreckel?
PATIENT: No, I don’t. I haven’t needed to, thankfully. I try to stay healthy. I eat… reasonably well, and I walk when I can, though marking papers doesn’t leave a lot of time for exercise. I haven’t had any… serious illnesses, to be honest. Just the occasional cold.
DOCTOR: Very well. If you would permit me, I’d like to conduct a brief physical examination. We will start with checking your vital signs, and then I’ll need to examine your leg and listen to your heart and lungs. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. That sounds… sensible. Please, do whatever you need to do. I would like to understand what’s causing this swelling, and get it sorted out, if possible. I have marking to get back to, you see. But I understand this is important.
DOCTOR: Please, have a seat. I'll start with your blood pressure and pulse. Blood pressure is 130/85. Pulse is 88 and… slightly irregular, as you described. Now, if you would please lie down, I’ll need to listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are… somewhat muffled. I do detect a slight murmur. Lungs are clear. There is some swelling present in your left calf, as you indicated. And… yes, there is pitting edema. Now, let me ask… do you have any history of blood clots?
PATIENT: Blood clots? No, not that I am aware of. I’ve never been told I was prone to them. I don't think so. I do get… cramps in my legs sometimes, especially at night, but I thought that was just from sitting for too long. Is that… related? I’m not sure I understand what you mean by ‘blood clots’ exactly. Is that something serious? I do try to drink plenty of water, though.
DOCTOR: A blood clot, Miss Kreckel, is a thickening of the blood that can obstruct circulation. It can be serious, yes, particularly if it travels to the lungs. The swelling and irregular heartbeat, combined with the edema, raise a concern for deep vein thrombosis – DVT – and potential pulmonary embolism. Now, to be clear, this is not a definitive diagnosis. We need to investigate further. I will order a D-dimer test and a lower extremity ultrasound. These tests will help us determine if a blood clot is present. Additionally, I will order an EKG to assess your heart rhythm more accurately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: That… sounds rather alarming, Doctor. A blood clot… travelling to my lungs? That doesn’t sound pleasant at all. So, these tests will tell you if that’s what’s happening? I… I think so. You want to check my blood, and… scan my leg? I understand that’s what you’re saying. It’s a bit… overwhelming, to be honest. I wasn't expecting all of this. But yes, please do whatever you think is necessary. I suppose I should be grateful you are taking this seriously. .
DOCTOR: Indeed. It is best to be thorough. The laboratory technician will draw blood shortly, and the radiology department will schedule the ultrasound. Given your symptoms and my preliminary findings, I am going to prescribe a low-dose anticoagulant as a preventative measure, pending the results of the tests. This will help to prevent any potential clot formation. It is crucial that you follow the instructions carefully. And… I strongly advise you to restrict your activity until we have a clearer understanding of the situation. Avoid prolonged sitting or standing. Please schedule a follow-up appointment with me in one week to discuss the results. If you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath, or worsening leg swelling, you must go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you understand?
