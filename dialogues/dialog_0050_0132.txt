DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Coby. I am Dr. Paraskevopoulos. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Heat intolerance, you say? Honestly, it’s about time someone looked into this. I've been dealing with it for… well, years now. It’s just… getting worse. I can’t even be outside for five minutes before I’m sweating like I ran a marathon. And it's not normal sweating, you know? It’s… different. Feels like my insides are melting. It's ridiculous. I used to be able to work all day in the sun building things, no problem. Now? Forget about it.
DOCTOR: Years, you say. And you’ve noticed a progressive worsening. “Different” sweating… can you elaborate on that, Mr. Coby?
PATIENT: Elaborate? What do you mean? It’s… stickier. And it smells different, too. Not like… body odor, exactly. More… chemical-ish, if that makes sense. And it doesn’t just happen when I’m hot. Sometimes it happens when I’m… well, thinking hard, or if I get nervous. It's embarrassing, really. A man shouldn’t be worrying about his sweat, should he? I’ve tried everything – different soaps, powders… nothing works. It's like my body just… doesn’t regulate properly anymore. And don’t tell me it’s just getting old. I still feel strong, thank you very much.
DOCTOR: “Chemical-ish,” and occurring with exertion of mental effort or nervousness… quite interesting. And you’ve attempted over-the-counter remedies without success. Let's delve a bit deeper. Have you noticed any associated symptoms with these episodes of excessive sweating?
PATIENT: Associated symptoms… hmm. Let me think. Well, sometimes my heart races a bit when it starts. Not a full-blown panic attack, mind you, just… faster than normal. And I get a bit shaky, especially in my hands. Oh, and I’ve been… thirstier than usual. Not just from the heat, I mean. Like, I wake up in the middle of the night needing a drink. And sometimes… sometimes I feel a little lightheaded. But I chalked that up to just… getting older, you know? It’s hard to keep track of what’s normal when you’re… seasoned. I don't go to the doctor much, usually. Waste of time, if you ask me. Mostly things fix themselves. But this… this is getting out of hand.
DOCTOR: Racing heart, shakiness, increased thirst, and lightheadedness… these are pertinent details, Mr. Coby. Now, let’s review your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Medical conditions… not really. Had the usual childhood stuff, measles, chickenpox, nothing serious. Broke my arm once, building a shed, but it healed fine. High blood pressure, the doctor told me a few years back, but he said it was “borderline” and told me to watch my salt intake. I mostly ignored him, to be honest. Never bothered me enough to change my diet. And… oh, I had a bit of a problem with my stomach a while back, but it cleared up on its own. I don’t really believe in all these fancy diagnoses, if you ask me. Most of it's just… hype. People go to the doctor and suddenly they have a name for everything. I'm a practical man. If it ain't broke, don't fix it. But this sweating… this is different. It’s unsettling.
DOCTOR: Borderline hypertension, and a self-resolved gastric issue… noted. Now, any surgeries in your past, Mr. Coby?
PATIENT: Surgeries… let me think. No, not really. Well, I had my tonsils out when I was a boy, but that was ages ago. And… oh, when I broke my arm, they had to set it, of course, but I don’t count that as a surgery. It wasn’t like… cutting me open or anything. Just… fixing a bone. Honestly, I've always been pretty lucky with my health. Never needed much doctoring. Tough as nails, that's me. But this sweating… it's starting to worry me. I need to know what’s going on, before it gets worse. I've got work to do, you know? Can't be laid up with some silly illness.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Coby. Now, let’s discuss your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family history… hmm. My father… he had a bit of a heart problem later in life. Not sure what exactly, the family doesn’t really talk about these things. Mostly they just… ignore it until it's too late. My mother… she was always pretty healthy, as far as I know. A bit frail towards the end, but nothing serious. I’ve got a few cousins, scattered around Nepal, but I haven’t seen them in years. We don't really keep in touch. I doubt they’ve got any fancy medical conditions, they’re farmers, you know? Practical people. This whole thing is ridiculous, honestly. Asking about family history… what good is that going to do? This is my body, my problem. I just want to know what’s going on and how to fix it.
DOCTOR: A family history of cardiac issues… noted, despite the lack of specifics. Now, Mr. Coby, could you tell me a little about your social history?
PATIENT: Social history… what do you mean? I live alone, if that’s what you’re asking. Never married. Too busy working, I suppose. Always been a bit of a loner, to be honest. I enjoy my own company. I drink… a little. A few beers with dinner, nothing excessive. And I don’t smoke. Never liked the smell of it. Mostly I just… work. Building things, fixing things. Keeps me busy, keeps me out of trouble. I don't really do much socializing. Not my cup of tea. I find people… draining, mostly. This whole conversation is draining, if I'm being honest. Can we just get to the bottom of this sweating thing? I’ve got a shed to build, you know? Time is money.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, lastly, are you currently taking any medications, or do you have any known allergies?
PATIENT: Medications? No. Never been one for pills. I don’t trust them. Give me a hammer and some nails any day. Allergies… not really. I get a bit of a sniffle sometimes during the monsoon season, but that's just the humidity. I'm a tough man. Don't get sick easily. Honestly, Doctor, are you almost done? I appreciate you trying to figure things out, but I've got a schedule to keep. This sweating… it’s the only thing bothering me. I just want to know what’s causing it, so I can get back to work. No pills, no fancy diagnoses, just a simple solution, if that's possible.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Coby. Given your history of excessive sweating, occurring for years, progressive worsening, and associated with racing heart, shakiness, and increased thirst, despite a lack of medication use or known allergies, we need to consider several possibilities. We will need to perform a physical exam. And I believe some laboratory testing is warranted, to rule out any underlying medical conditions. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Laboratory testing… you mean blood work and all that? Honestly, Doctor, it sounds like a waste of time. But… fine. If you think it’s necessary. I’m not thrilled about it, but I want this sorted out. A physical exam… that's fine too. Just… be quick about it. I’ve got things to do. So, what exactly are we looking for with these tests? And will it take long? I’m not one for spending hours in a doctor's office. Time is money, remember? Just tell me what you need to do, and let's get it over with. This sweating… it’s really starting to get in the way.
DOCTOR: Very well. We will begin with a basic physical exam: checking your heart rate and blood pressure, listening to your lungs, and a general assessment. The laboratory tests will include a complete blood count, electrolytes, thyroid function tests, and a glucose level. These tests will help rule out any underlying causes for your symptoms, such as hyperthyroidism, electrolyte imbalances, or diabetes. It should not take an excessive amount of time. Please have a seat on the examination table and we’ll begin.
PATIENT: Fine. Just… try not to poke too much. I'm not exactly fond of being prodded and poked. And if it's going to take long, let me know. I've got a shed to build, you know. A perfectly good shed, just waiting for me to finish it. . Get it over with, then.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Coby. Let's start with your blood pressure. 140/90. A little elevated, but not surprising given your history. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Heart rate is 88, regular rhythm. Lungs are clear, no wheezing or crackles. Thyroid gland is normal to palpation, no enlargement or nodules. Skin is warm and dry. Now, let’s have you take a deep breath. Chest is resonant bilaterally. Everything seems unremarkable so far. Do you have any areas of pain or discomfort I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No pain or discomfort. Just… this sweating. It’s mostly on my back and chest. And my face gets really flushed sometimes. Honestly, Doctor, it feels like I'm melting. It's not just a little sweat, it’s… profuse. And it smells… different. You said everything seems unremarkable, but this isn’t unremarkable to me. It’s affecting my work, my comfort… everything. Are you sure you can’t just give me something for it? Some kind of… anti-sweat spray or something? I don't want to spend all day getting poked and prodded and then find out there’s nothing you can do.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Coby. While a simple solution would be ideal, given your history and the unusual nature of your symptoms, we need to rule out any underlying medical causes. I’m going to order some blood work now, as discussed. While we’re waiting, I'd like to ask a few more questions about your sweating. Has it worsened with any particular foods or activities?
PATIENT: Foods or activities… hmm. It doesn’t seem to be worse with any particular food, no. I eat pretty much everything. Though… it does seem worse when I’m stressed. Building things can be stressful, you know? Especially when you're trying to get it done quickly. And… thinking hard. Like, if I’m trying to figure out a complicated design or something, it starts. And… when I'm talking to people. Especially people I don't like. It’s ridiculous, I know. A man shouldn’t be sweating just because he's talking to someone. But it happens. It’s embarrassing. Honestly, Doctor, are you sure it's not just… nerves? I'm a practical man. Maybe I just need to relax a bit.
DOCTOR: Stress and mental exertion… that is relevant. While stress can certainly exacerbate sweating, the fact that it's been ongoing for years, associated with other symptoms like racing heart and increased thirst, and not easily controlled with over-the-counter remedies suggests we need to investigate further. We've already ordered the bloodwork. In the meantime, I'd like to ask about your bowel movements. Have you experienced any changes in your stool lately?
PATIENT: Changes in… my stool? What kind of question is that? Honestly, Doctor, are you serious? I'm here because I'm sweating like a pig, not because my… bowels are acting up. I eat, I… go. What else is there to say? It’s perfectly normal, thank you very much. This is getting ridiculous. Asking about stool… it’s like you’re trying to find something, anything, to blame. I just want to know what’s causing this sweating and how to fix it. Are you sure these tests are going to help? They sound like a waste of time. And frankly, asking about my… bowel movements is just… inappropriate.
DOCTOR: Mr. Coby, I apologize if my questions seem intrusive, but a thorough medical evaluation requires me to consider all possibilities. Changes in bowel habits can sometimes be indicative of underlying medical conditions, such as hyperthyroidism or certain endocrine disorders, which could also explain your sweating. However, I understand your discomfort, and we can move on from that topic. Let’s focus on your current medications again. Are you absolutely certain you aren't taking any over-the-counter supplements or herbal remedies, even occasionally?
PATIENT: Absolutely certain! I told you, I don't trust pills. Not prescription, not over-the-counter, not fancy herbal remedies. Give me a hammer and some nails, that’s all I need. Honestly, Doctor, you're starting to make me feel like you don't believe me. I’m a practical man. I’m telling you the truth. I’ve never been one for taking anything I don’t need. I eat a good diet, I work hard, I sleep enough. That’s all I do. And I’m sweating like a pig. Is that so hard to believe? Are you sure there isn’t something simpler you can give me? Some kind of… cream or spray? Anything to stop this ridiculous sweating.
DOCTOR: Mr. Coby, I understand your frustration, and I assure you I am not questioning your honesty. However, given the persistence and unusual nature of your symptoms – years of excessive sweating, racing heart, increased thirst, worsened with stress, and unresponsive to simple remedies – and despite your firm denial of any medication or supplement use, we must proceed with the laboratory testing to rule out any underlying medical causes. Once we have the results, we can discuss potential treatment options. I will order the tests now, and the lab technician will contact you to schedule an appointment. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding strenuous activity and staying well-hydrated. Is there anything else I can address at this time?
PATIENT: No. No, there isn't. Just… get the tests done quickly. I've got a shed to build, you know? A perfectly good shed, waiting for me. And I'm losing valuable time sitting here, answering ridiculous questions about my… stool. . Let’s just get this over with.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Coby. Here is the requisition form for the blood work. The lab is located at [provides address]. They will contact you to schedule an appointment. Once the results are available, we will review them together and discuss potential treatment options. I understand your frustration and I assure you we are doing everything we can to get to the bottom of this.
