DOCTOR: Good morning, Soila. My name is Dr. Andraca. It’s nice to meet you. I see you’re 90 years young – that’s wonderful! To start, can you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Ninety… yes, that’s right. Seems like yesterday I was a little girl! Um… what brings me in? Let me think… My tummy… it’s gotten… big. And I don’t eat like I used to. Not much hungry, you see? It just feels… full, even when it’s not.
DOCTOR: Okay, Soila, I understand. Your tummy feels bigger, and you haven’t been very hungry lately, and it feels full even when you haven’t eaten much. That’s good information to start with. When did you first start noticing this feeling of fullness, and has it been getting worse gradually, or did it come on suddenly?
PATIENT: Oh dear… when did I notice? That’s a hard one. Things… blur, you know? It feels like a long time now. Maybe… a few weeks? It didn't jump big all at once. More… slowly. Like a balloon filling up, little by little. Not fast. I hope that makes sense?
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense, Soila. “Slowly, like a balloon filling up” – that’s a very helpful way to describe it. A few weeks, gradually getting bigger… okay. And besides the feeling of fullness, have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Changes… hmm. Let me see. I feel… tired, sometimes. More tired than usual, maybe. And… oh! My clothes… they feel a little tighter, even the ones I haven’t washed in a while. Not just around the tummy, but… everywhere, a little bit. Is that… normal?
DOCTOR: Okay, Soila. Increased tiredness and your clothes feeling a bit tighter… those are important things to mention. No, it’s good you’re telling me – we want to understand what’s going on. Have you had any changes in your bowel movements?
PATIENT: Bowel… movements? Oh dear. That's… a private question, isn't it? I... I go to the bathroom, yes. But... I don't know if it's different. Maybe… a little harder to go sometimes? But I have always had trouble with that, you know? Old age… it does things to you. I don't want to bother you with too much detail.
DOCTOR: It’s okay, Soila, you're not bothering me at all. These questions are important, even if they feel a bit personal. It helps me understand what’s going on. “A little harder to go sometimes” is good to know. And have you noticed any unintentional weight gain or weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Oh, weight… I haven't been on the scale in… well, a very long time. I feel a little heavier, maybe? But that could just be the tummy filling out, you know? I don’t weigh myself. Never really have. It doesn’t matter much at my age.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Soila. It's perfectly fine that you don’t weigh yourself regularly. It sounds like you feel a bit heavier, which could be related to the fullness you’re experiencing. Now, let's talk a little bit about your medical history. Do you have any medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Medical… history? Oh dear. That's a long time ago. I had… something with my heart, a long time ago. But the doctor fixed it. A long time ago. And… I used to have trouble with my blood pressure, but they gave me pills for that. I take those every day, I think. Little white ones. And… that's all I can remember, really. I’ve seen a lot of doctors in my life, you know? It all blurs together.
DOCTOR: Okay, Soila, that’s helpful. You had a heart condition that was fixed, and you take little white pills for your blood pressure. Do you know the name of the blood pressure medication?
PATIENT: Oh, the name… no, I don't think so. I just take them every morning with my breakfast. The bottle… it's at home. My neighbor, Mrs. Petrov, she helps me with my pills sometimes. She might know the name. I don't like to bother her too much.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Soila. We can look it up later. It’s good you’re taking something for your blood pressure. And are you currently taking any other medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Let me think... sometimes I take a little something for my joints. They ache, you know? Especially when the weather is bad. It's a little bottle, pinkish color. But not every day. Only when they really bother me. And… sometimes I take a vitamin, a little orange one, but I forget sometimes. It's all very… haphazard.
DOCTOR: Okay, Soila. Something for your joints when they ache, and an orange vitamin sometimes. That’s helpful to know. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything besides the heart condition you mentioned?
PATIENT: Surgeries… Oh, let me see. I broke my hip a long time ago, when I was younger. They fixed it, yes. Had to stay in the hospital for a while. And… I think I had my gallbladder out, a long time ago too. But it was so long ago, I barely remember. Everything is a blur, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, Soila, you had surgery to repair a broken hip and had your gallbladder removed. That’s important information. And finally, let’s talk a little bit about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family history… oh dear. That's a long story. My mother… she had trouble with her heart too. And my father… he had something with his stomach, I think. But they both lived to be very old, you know? So it wasn't too bad. Everyone in my family was… sturdy. They didn't complain much.
DOCTOR: Okay, Soila, heart trouble in your mother and something with the stomach in your father. That’s helpful to know. Thank you for sharing all of that with me, Soila. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, and I'll gently feel your abdomen to get a better understanding of what’s going on. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, Doctor. That sounds… alright. Do what you need to do. I trust you. I’ve had a lot of doctors in my life, you know. Just… be gentle, please. My tummy is a little sensitive.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Soila. I will be very gentle. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a few deep breaths for me. Your heart sounds a bit… irregular, a little fast, but not alarming. Your lungs sound clear. Now, I’m going to gently feel your abdomen. Please let me know if anything feels painful. I notice some fullness in your lower abdomen. It’s not sharply painful, but it is tender to the touch. There doesn’t appear to be any significant guarding or rigidity. I'm also noting some mild swelling.
PATIENT: Oh… does that sound bad, Doctor? It doesn’t hurt hurt, just… uncomfortable. Full. Like a balloon, you know? And you said… swelling? I haven’t really noticed. Old age… it makes you numb to things, I think. What do you think it is? Is it serious?
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Soila, try not to worry. The swelling is mild, and the tenderness isn't severe. It's good you haven’t noticed sharp pain. Based on what you’ve told me and the exam findings, there are a few possibilities we need to consider. It could be something as simple as constipation or bloating, but given the fullness, the tenderness, and mild swelling, it’s important to rule out other potential causes. I’m concerned about the possibility of ascites – that's a buildup of fluid in the abdomen – or, less likely but we need to check, something involving the organs in your abdomen. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order a few tests. I’m going to order a Complete Blood Count, a Comprehensive Metabolic Panel, and an abdominal ultrasound. The ultrasound will allow us to see what’s going on inside your abdomen without being invasive. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh dear… tests? Ultrasound? That sounds… complicated. I don’t like tests. They always make me nervous. But… if you think it’s important, Doctor, then yes. Do what you need to do. But please… explain everything very carefully. I don’t understand much of this medical talk. And… will it hurt?
DOCTOR: It’s okay, Soila, it's perfectly normal to feel nervous about tests. I understand. We’ll take things one step at a time. The blood tests are very simple – just a small sample of blood taken from your arm. The ultrasound is completely painless. It involves using a gel on your abdomen and moving a small wand over your skin to create images of your organs. It doesn’t involve any needles or radiation. A technician will perform the ultrasound, and I’ll review the results with you as soon as they’re available. We’ll get the lab order sent to the lab right here in town. They will call you when they are ready for the blood draw. Then, we’ll schedule the ultrasound for you. Do you have any questions about the tests or anything we’ve discussed so far?
PATIENT: No… I don't think so. You explained it very nicely, Doctor. Just… when will I know the results? I don’t like waiting. And… will it cost much? I don’t have much money, you know. I don’t have insurance.
DOCTOR: That’s a very important question, Soila. I understand your concern about the cost. The lab results typically take 24-48 hours to come back. The ultrasound results usually take a little longer, maybe a few days. We’ll call you as soon as we have them. Regarding the cost, I know you don’t have insurance, and that can be a worry. I’m going to speak with our billing department and see what options are available for financial assistance. We have programs that may be able to help cover some of the costs. We can also discuss potentially prioritizing the most essential tests first, if needed. I will have someone from the billing department reach out to you directly to discuss this further. In the meantime, I want to assure you that we’ll do everything we can to get you the answers you need and ensure you receive the best possible care. Do you have any other questions or concerns right now?
PATIENT: Oh… that's very kind of you, Doctor. Thank you. It’s a relief to know someone will talk to me about the money. I… I think that’s all my questions for now. Just… try not to scare me too much, alright? I’m an old woman, and I get frightened easily.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Soila. I will do my very best to keep you informed and not cause any unnecessary worry. It’s perfectly alright to be frightened, and I’ll explain everything in a way that’s easy to understand. We'll take things one step at a time. We will call you when the lab results are available. We will also have the billing department reach out to you. If you experience any worsening pain, significant swelling, or any other new symptoms, please don’t hesitate to call the office right away. Thank you for coming in today, Soila. It was nice meeting you, and I look forward to discussing the results with you soon. Is there anyone who can help you get home safely?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, Doctor. My neighbor, Mrs. Petrov, she usually helps me. She’s a good woman. Thank you for everything. You’re very kind. I… I think that’s all.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Soila. I’m glad Mrs. Petrov is there to help. Take care, and please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns.
