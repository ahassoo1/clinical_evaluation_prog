DOCTOR: Right. Sherion Chelberg. 62 years old. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It’s… my chest. It’s been hurting. Not all the time, but… enough to worry me. It feels like… a tight squeeze, mostly. And sometimes a little achy.
DOCTOR: A tight squeeze, you say?
PATIENT: Yes. Like… someone is hugging my chest very hard. Not painful painful, but… uncomfortable. It comes and goes. Usually when I'm walking, maybe? Or if I climb stairs. But not always. Sometimes just… sitting. It’s hard to say exactly.
DOCTOR: And how long has this been going on?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… maybe… three weeks now? A little over, I think. At first it wasn't so bad. I thought maybe I just overdid it in the garden. But it hasn't really gone away. It just… stays. Sometimes better, sometimes worse. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It's… vague, but yes. Three weeks of intermittent chest tightness. Have you noticed anything else accompanying this, Mrs. Chelberg?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. Not really. I get a little… breathless sometimes, when the chest feels tight. But I’m not a young woman, Doctor! I get breathless going up the stairs anyway. And… no, nothing else. No pain in my arm, no sweating… just the tight feeling and a little… worried. My husband, he says I should come see someone. He worries more than I do!
DOCTOR: Right. No radiating pain, no diaphoresis. Just the tightness and some dyspnea on exertion… or even at rest, occasionally?
PATIENT: Dys… what-ia? Oh! Shortness of breath. Yes. Sometimes even just… sitting and watching the TV. Not bad shortness of breath, but… I have to remind myself to take a deep breath. It’s not like I’m gasping for air or anything. Just… aware of my breathing. Is that… normal? I don't know what is normal anymore.
DOCTOR: Well, “normal” is subjective, Mrs. Chelberg. Let's go through some other things. Do you have any history of… heart problems?
PATIENT: No, never. My father, he had high blood pressure, but I don't… I don’t think I do. I haven’t really been to the doctor much in years. Just… checkups now and then. They always said I was fine. Good blood work. Everything normal. That was… oh, maybe five years ago now? I don’t remember exactly. My husband makes me go. He’s very good about that.
DOCTOR: And what about any other medical conditions?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I have a little arthritis in my hands. It’s mostly just stiff in the morning. And… I had my gallbladder out, years and years ago. Must be twenty years now? More? Everything was fine after that. No problems. And… oh! I have a little bit of diabetes, but it's managed with pills. I take one a day. It’s not… bad diabetes. The doctor says I do pretty good controlling it. Does that… matter?
DOCTOR: It potentially matters, Mrs. Chelberg. Okay. So, we have arthritis, cholecystectomy twenty years ago, and controlled type 2 diabetes. Any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything. I take the pill for the diabetes, and sometimes a little something for my arthritis when it’s really acting up. But never anything… serious. The doctor gave me some cream once, for a rash, but that was years ago. Nothing I remember being allergic to. I don’t think so.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any other medications, vitamins, or herbal supplements?
PATIENT: Oh! Well, I take a little vitamin D. The doctor said my levels were low last year. Just one little pill every day. And… sometimes, when my friend Maria tells me, I try those ginger candies for my stomach. But that’s not a medicine, really. Just a candy. It helps sometimes, if I feel a little queasy. But I don’t take it every day. Or even every week.
DOCTOR: Right. So, vitamin D, and occasional ginger candies. Now, let's move on to your social history. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: Oh, no, never. My mother smoked, and it made her so sick. I swore I would never touch a cigarette. And I haven’t. Not even once. No, Doctor. Never smoked.
DOCTOR: Good. Alcohol consumption?
PATIENT: Oh, just a little wine sometimes. With dinner. Maybe… two glasses, two or three times a week? Sometimes less. I don’t drink very much. And my husband, he doesn't drink at all. So it's not like I'm sitting here drinking every night. Just… a little with my food. It helps me relax.
DOCTOR: Alright. And finally, a quick question about family history. Any history of heart disease, stroke, or sudden death in your family?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… My grandfather, on my father's side, he had a heart attack. A long time ago. But he smoked, Doctor. And he didn't take care of himself. And my aunt, she had a stroke, but she was very old. I think she was in her nineties. Other than that… not that I know of. My mother, she died of… something else. I don’t remember exactly. It was a long time ago. She was sick for a long time before she died. Does that help? I’m not very good remembering family history. It's so… complicated.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mrs. Chelberg. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, and then I’ll feel your abdomen. After that, we'll see if we need to do any further testing. If you could just lie down for me, please.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. Here I go… Is it going to be cold? I always get cold so easily.
DOCTOR: Just a quick listen, Mrs. Chelberg. Try to breathe deeply for me. Heart sounds are… regular, but slightly diminished. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally, although your breathing is somewhat shallow. Now, if you'll just bend your knees and let me palpate your abdomen. Is there any tenderness here?
PATIENT: Okay. Not usually. Sometimes it’s a little… achy, but it goes away. Ooh, a little tender there. On the right side. Not painful, but… sensitive. Like… when I push on it. Is that bad?
DOCTOR: There’s some mild tenderness in the right upper quadrant. No rebound tenderness or guarding. Alright. I think we'll order some blood work, just to get a baseline. We'll check your complete blood count, electrolytes, kidney function, liver enzymes, and a cardiac enzyme panel. And, given your symptoms and some of what I'm hearing, I also want to order an EKG. The lab technician will be in shortly to draw some blood, and then we'll get you set up for the EKG. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. That sounds… good. As long as it will tell us what’s wrong. I don't like feeling this… worried. I just want to know if it's serious, you know? Blood work and… EKG? Is that the one with the sticky things on my chest? My husband, he’ll be glad you’re doing all this. He’s always saying I need to get checked out.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s the one. It's a simple, non-invasive test. The technician will place electrodes on your chest to record your heart's electrical activity. It doesn’t hurt. We’ll get the results back as quickly as possible. In the meantime, I want you to avoid strenuous activity. And if you experience any chest pain that doesn’t subside, or any shortness of breath that is significantly worse, go to the emergency room immediately. Understand?
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. No strenuous activity… and go to the emergency room if it gets worse. I understand. It just… comes and goes. Sometimes I feel fine all day, and then… suddenly, this tight feeling. It’s scary. The emergency room… that sounds… serious. I hope it doesn't come to that. When will I get the results? Will you call me?
DOCTOR: The results usually take 24 to 48 hours. My office will call you with the results. They will page you. It is unlikely to be an emergency, Mrs. Chelberg. We are being thorough. The technician should be in shortly. Do you have any other questions for me before I leave?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been… very helpful. Even if it’s a little scary. I just hope it’s nothing… serious. My husband will be so worried if it is. I’ll just… sit here and wait for the nice lady to draw the blood. Thank you again, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Very well. I'll see you again soon. .
PATIENT: .
