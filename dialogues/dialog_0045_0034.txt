DOCTOR: Alright, Emileigh Bonck, 21 years old. Good to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Um, hi. Well, I just moved here… with my husband. And I guess… I need to get, like, set up with a doctor? It’s kinda a check-up, I think? I don’t really… remember what they said back home.
DOCTOR: Okay, establishing care. That's perfectly reasonable. A general check-up is a good idea when you're new to an area. Just to be thorough, let’s go through some things. You said you moved here with your husband… are you both establishing care with us, or just you today?
PATIENT: Just me today, I think. He's… okay. Doesn't really need a doctor, he says. He's pretty tough. But yeah, just me for now.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, let's start with the basics. Do you have any current medical problems – anything you're being treated for, or anything that’s been bothering you for a while?
PATIENT: Hmm… not really? I mean, I get tired sometimes, but… everyone does, right? I don’t… I don’t think I’m sick sick. Nothing the doctor back home ever wrote down, anyway. I can’t really remember.
DOCTOR: Okay. Well, fatigue can be a symptom of a lot of things, so it's good you mentioned it. We’ll definitely look into that. Let’s go through a quick review of systems – just a series of questions to get a better picture of things. Have you noticed any recent weight changes – either loss or gain?
PATIENT: Oh! Um… maybe a little? I think I’ve gained a bit. Moving is… stressful, and I like to eat when I'm stressed. Not a lot, but… enough to need new jeans, maybe.
DOCTOR: Okay, weight gain. Any changes in your appetite?
PATIENT: Yeah, actually. I’ve been… hungrier than usual, I think. Even when I’m not stressed. It's kinda weird. I used to not be able to finish my dinner, and now I'm asking for seconds.
DOCTOR: Alright. And how about your sleep?
PATIENT: Sleep… is okay, I guess? I don’t sleep great. I kinda toss and turn a lot. And I wake up a few times during the night. But I get enough hours, usually. Maybe six or seven? I don’t really… keep track.
DOCTOR: Six to seven hours isn’t ideal, Emileigh. Most adults need closer to eight. Okay. Any fevers, chills, night sweats?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. I haven't felt hot or anything. And I don’t… sweat a lot at night. Not that I notice, anyway.
DOCTOR: Alright. Any problems with your digestion?
PATIENT: Um… sometimes? I get kinda… bloated, I guess. And a little gassy. It’s embarrassing. Nothing serious, though. Just… uncomfortable sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay. We'll get to the bottom of this. Now, have you noticed any changes in your skin?
PATIENT: Changes… hmm. Not really? I mean, I get sunburned easy, but that's just… me. I'm kinda pale. No rashes or anything weird.
DOCTOR: Pale skin is good to know. Any joint pain or stiffness?
PATIENT: No, not really. My joints… feel okay. I work with my hands a lot, so they get tired sometimes, but that's just from work. Not pain, though.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's move on to past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any serious medical conditions?
PATIENT: Um… not that I know of? I had chickenpox when I was little, but… everyone gets that, right? I don’t remember being sick with anything else. My mom would have told me if I did.
DOCTOR: Alright. Any surgeries or hospitalizations in the past?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. Never had surgery. Never been in the hospital.
DOCTOR: Good. And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Just… vitamins, sometimes. My husband gets them for me. Multivitamins, I think. And… sometimes I take something for headaches, if I have one. Just… whatever’s at the store.
DOCTOR: What kind of headaches?
PATIENT: Just… regular headaches. Like, tension headaches. You know, from stress. I get them when I'm tired or worried. Nothing bad. Just… annoying. I take… ibuprofen, I think? Or acetaminophen? I always forget which one is which.
DOCTOR: Okay. Let's talk about allergies. Are you allergic to any medications, foods, or environmental factors?
PATIENT: Um… not that I know of? I get itchy sometimes when I'm outside, but I think that's just bugs. And… I don't think I've ever had a really bad reaction to anything.
DOCTOR: Alright. And finally, let's talk about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Um… that's hard. I don't really… know my family that well? My mom… didn't talk about it much. I think my grandma had… something with her heart? And my uncle… maybe diabetes? But I'm not really sure.
DOCTOR: Okay. Well, that gives us a starting point. Now, I'm going to need to do a quick physical exam. Can you step on the scale for me?
PATIENT: Oh, okay. Sure.
DOCTOR: 82 kilograms... and your height is 150 centimeters, correct?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds right. I think so.
DOCTOR: Okay. Your BMI is 36.2, which puts you in the obese category. We'll discuss that further. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Can you take a deep breath for me?
PATIENT: Obese? Oh. Um… okay.
DOCTOR: Heart sounds are normal. Lungs are clear. Now, let’s check your reflexes.
PATIENT: Okay…
DOCTOR: Reflexes are normal. Now, I’m going to palpate your abdomen. Let me know if anything feels tender.
PATIENT: Okay… Ooh, that's a little… sensitive there. On the left side.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Tender to palpation in the left upper quadrant. Any pain radiating anywhere?
PATIENT: No, not really. Just… uncomfortable there. Like a dull ache, sometimes. It's not bad bad.
DOCTOR: Alright. Based on what you’ve told me and the exam, it sounds like you're experiencing some fatigue, weight gain, and abdominal discomfort. Given your BMI and the tenderness in your abdomen, I want to rule out a few things. I'm going to order some blood work - a complete metabolic panel, a lipid panel, and a thyroid panel. We'll also do a urine test.
PATIENT: Blood work? Urine test? Oh… Is something… wrong?
DOCTOR: Not necessarily, Emileigh. It's just standard procedure when someone presents with these symptoms. We need to get a baseline and rule out any underlying medical conditions. Things like thyroid issues and liver problems can cause fatigue and abdominal discomfort. It's better to be thorough. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Um… where do I go for the tests? And… will it hurt?
DOCTOR: Here. This pamphlet has the address of the lab just down the street. It's a simple blood draw and a urine sample. The blood draw will be a quick pinch – you won’t even feel it. The urine sample is… well, you know. It's nothing to worry about. The results will take a few days. We'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them then. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Okay… a few days. That sounds… okay. So, just go to the lab, and they'll… do the tests? And then I come back here?
DOCTOR: Exactly. The lab will send the results directly to us. We'll call you to schedule a follow-up appointment once they're in. In the meantime, try to get some more sleep and focus on eating a balanced diet. And try not to stress about it. It's likely nothing serious. Do you have any other questions before you leave?
PATIENT: Um… no, I think that’s all. Thank you, Doctor Billman.
DOCTOR: Alright. Have a good day. And don’t hesitate to call if you have any concerns. .
PATIENT: .
