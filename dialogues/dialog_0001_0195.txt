DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Micucci. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, well, it’s not really a problem, you understand. More like... a little boost. My daughter, she says I should come get a card. A “Get Well” card, or maybe one that’s… encouraging? From you, the doctor. It just feels nice to have, you know? Makes me feel like people are thinking of me. Not that anything’s wrong, exactly.
DOCTOR: Right. A card. Look, I'm a doctor, not a… Hallmark representative. But, fine. Let’s just… cover the basics so I can write something appropriate. You said your daughter brought you in?
PATIENT: Yes, my daughter, Priya. She worries too much, that one. Always has. Says I don’t take care of myself. Which isn’t true! I make sure to have my tea, and I go to the temple when I can. But she thinks a card from you will… validate things, I suppose. It’s silly, really. But what does she know? She’s always been a bit dramatic. You don’t need to write anything fancy, just… something polite. And maybe a flower on it?
DOCTOR: So, to be clear, you’re here for a note… because your daughter thinks you need reassurance?
PATIENT: Well, reassurance makes it sound so… weak! It’s more like a… a little acknowledgement. She says I’ve been a bit down lately, which is just because the weather has been awful. Makes my bones ache, you know? And I miss my sister, she moved to Kathmandu last year. But I’m fine. Truly. Just… Priya thinks a card from a doctor would be… official. And it might quiet her down for a bit. You understand daughters, don’t you? They can be… a lot.
DOCTOR: Right. Kathmandu. And aches with the weather. Look, Ms. Micucci, with all due respect, I have patients with actual medical concerns waiting. Let's just go through a quick review of systems. Just to cover all bases. Do you have any fever, chills, or night sweats?
PATIENT: Oh, no, no fever. Definitely not. And chills? Only when it’s actually cold! It’s August, Doctor. And night sweats... well, sometimes I get a bit warm under my blankets, but that's just because I like to be cozy. Really, I’m perfectly healthy. Priya just gets anxious. She read something online about… I don't know, something about seasonal affective disorder? It's ridiculous, honestly. It’s just the weather. I've lived through a lot of winters, you know. Nepal gets cold! This is nothing.
DOCTOR: Alright. Any changes in your appetite or weight?
PATIENT: Oh, my appetite is fine! I love my dal bhat, always have. And weight? Well, maybe I’ve lost a little weight, but that's just because I’ve been walking more. It's good for you, you know, to stay active. Priya keeps saying I need to “watch my intake,” whatever that means. She makes these fancy salads with… kale? I prefer my traditional foods, thank you very much. Much more satisfying. It's good for the soul, Doctor. Not just the body.
DOCTOR: Okay. Any trouble sleeping?
PATIENT: Sleeping is... alright. I wake up sometimes, yes. But that's just because... well, I think about things. My sister, mostly. And the temple. I worry about things, you understand? It’s just my nature. But I don’t need sleeping pills or anything. A cup of warm milk usually does the trick. And a little prayer. Honestly, Doctor, I think Priya is making a mountain out of a molehill. It's just... normal life things. A little ache here, a little worry there. Everyone goes through it. I just need a card so she'll stop fussing.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s do a quick physical exam, just to be thorough. Blood pressure, pulse, listen to your heart and lungs… standard stuff. It'll take five minutes. Then I can write your… note.
PATIENT: Oh. Oh, dear. Must we? Honestly, I feel perfectly fine. I don't want to bother you with all that. It’s really just the card, you see. I'm sure you have more important patients to see. But... if you insist. Very well. But don't poke too much, alright? My bones are a bit sensitive, you know. And please, don't tell Priya I came in for a full examination. She’ll just get even more worked up. It’s a bit embarrassing, honestly.
DOCTOR: Just relax. Blood pressure first. Blood pressure is a little low, 100/60. Heart sounds are regular, but a bit faint. Lungs are clear, but breath sounds are diminished. And your weight is 55 kilograms...that's a BMI of 17. That's underweight, Ms. Micucci. Very underweight.
PATIENT: Oh dear. Underweight? That's… surprising. I eat plenty, honestly. Perhaps the scale is wrong? Priya does keep buying me those fancy teas, perhaps they make me… lighter? I’ve always been slender, you know. It runs in the family. And my sister, she was always tiny. Perhaps it’s just my constitution. Honestly, Doctor, I feel perfectly healthy. A little tired sometimes, perhaps. But who isn’t tired? It's August! And all this fussing from Priya isn’t helping, I can assure you. It stresses me out. A card would really calm things down, you see. It's a matter of peace of mind, really. Not medical concern.
DOCTOR: Right. We'll need to run some blood tests. Just to rule things out. Basic metabolic panel, complete blood count, thyroid function…and vitamin D levels. And I want you to schedule a follow-up appointment in two weeks. We need to address this weight loss. This isn’t about a card, Ms. Micucci. This is about your health.
PATIENT: Oh dear, oh dear. Blood tests? Now you're scaring me! I really think this is unnecessary. I told you, I feel perfectly fine. My daughter… she always jumps to conclusions. And blood tests? I've never had blood tests for simply feeling a little tired! This is all rather… dramatic, don't you think? And a follow-up appointment? I have temple duties, you know. And I promised to help Priya with her garden. Honestly, Doctor, I think you're overreacting. I just wanted a nice card to cheer me up. And now this? It's all rather… upsetting. I think I'm going to need a cup of tea. Perhaps Priya could bring me one. And please, don't tell her you're running tests. She'll just worry herself sick. She does that, you know. It's exhausting.
DOCTOR: Look, Ms. Micucci, I understand your reluctance. But I'm concerned. Low weight, faint heart sounds… these things require investigation. I’m going to order the tests, and schedule the follow-up. I’ll write a brief note for your daughter, stating you came in for a check-up. And I strongly advise you not to downplay your symptoms to anyone. I’ll have the lab slip and appointment card ready in a few minutes. .
