DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Glymph. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Eriberto Bakan. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Bakan. It is a pleasure to meet you as well. Oh dear… what brings me in… now, let me see. It’s… well, it's my stomach, I believe. A good deal of pain, lower down. It comes and goes, you understand, but it’s been… troublesome lately. I do apologize, my memory isn’t what it used to be. Something about… a condition I have? SLE, is that right? It’s… a long story, I'm afraid.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Ms. Glymph. Systemic Lupus Erythematosus, or SLE, is quite a complex condition, and it’s understandable that it can contribute to various symptoms. No need to apologize at all for any difficulty recalling details – we’ll take our time and work through everything together. So, this stomach pain… you mentioned it comes and goes. Could you describe the pain for me?
PATIENT: Oh, you know, Doctor, it’s not a pleasant pain, that much I can assure you. It’s… a cramping sort of feeling, mostly. Like a tight knot. And sometimes it’s sharper, a stabbing sensation, though not constantly. It seems to come in waves, really. It’s hard to explain… it’s just… uncomfortable. And it worries me, naturally. I haven't had this much trouble with it in… well, I can’t recall precisely when I last felt this bad. . It feels… swollen, perhaps? Although that could be my imagination.
DOCTOR: Thank you for describing it so clearly, Ms. Glymph. “Cramping, tight knot with waves of sharper, stabbing sensation” – that’s very helpful. And you’re right to be concerned when experiencing a change in your usual level of discomfort. You mentioned feeling swollen. Is that a recent development, or has this been ongoing?
PATIENT: Oh, that's very kind of you to say so, Doctor. I do try to be precise, though it's not always easy! The swelling… yes, that is fairly recent. Within the last… hmm. Perhaps a week? Maybe a little longer. It’s not dramatic, you understand. It’s more… a feeling of fullness, a tightness, than a visible bulge. I haven’t been measuring myself, if that’s what you mean! It’s just… different from how I usually feel. And with the pain, naturally, it's concerning.
DOCTOR: No need to measure, Ms. Glymph. Your description is perfectly adequate. “Feeling of fullness and tightness” within the last week, coinciding with the pain – that’s important information. Now, to get a more complete picture, I'd like to ask a few more questions, if you don’t mind. Have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits recently?
PATIENT: Oh, certainly, Doctor, ask away. I do want to be helpful. Bowel habits… now, let me see. Hmm. It's… a bit irregular, I suppose. Not drastically so, but… less frequent than usual, perhaps? And… a little more difficult to… pass, if you understand. Nothing alarming, mind you. Just… not as smooth as it should be. And… I do apologize for being so… descriptive! It’s just a difficult subject to discuss, naturally.
DOCTOR: You’re not at all being overly descriptive, Ms. Glymph. It’s important to be thorough, and these are precisely the sorts of details we need to understand what’s going on. “Less frequent and more difficult to pass” – I appreciate you sharing that. Now, have you noticed any blood in your stool, or any changes in its color?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That’s… a rather unpleasant question, Doctor. Let me see… no, I don’t believe so. No visible blood, at least. And the color… well, it seems normal enough. Perhaps a little darker than usual, but that could be due to… well, I don’t know! My diet hasn’t been the best, I confess. I do try to eat well, but… sometimes it's difficult. But no, no noticeable blood. I would remember that, surely. It would be… quite alarming.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Glymph. It’s good to know there’s no visible blood. And it’s perfectly alright if your diet hasn’t been ideal recently – we can address that later if needed. Now, let’s move on to other symptoms. Have you experienced any nausea, vomiting, or loss of appetite?
PATIENT: Oh dear, now you are asking about unpleasant things! Yes, actually. A little bit of nausea, on and off. Not severe, just a queasy feeling. And my appetite… it has been rather poor lately. I haven't been eating as much as usual. Things just don't seem as appealing. And I… I haven't actually vomited, thankfully. No, no vomiting. But the lack of appetite is… concerning, because I'm already quite thin, you see.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Glymph. "Queasy feeling and decreased appetite" – that helps us build a clearer picture. Given your history of SLE, and these new symptoms, I'd like to ask about any other changes you’ve noticed. Have you experienced any fever, chills, fatigue, or any joint pain?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Now there's a list! Fever… a little bit, perhaps? Nothing dramatic, just a slight feeling of being warm. No chills, though. Fatigue… oh, yes, always fatigue. It’s just part of the… condition, you see. But it’s been worse lately, I suppose. And joint pain… yes, a little bit in my hands and wrists. It comes and goes, like everything else. It's not crippling, mind you. Just a little ache. But it is… bothersome. It makes it difficult to… well, to do things.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Glymph. “Slight fever, increased fatigue, and joint pain in hands and wrists” – this is very helpful. Now, thinking about your past medical history, aside from the SLE, have you had any other significant illnesses or surgeries?
PATIENT: Oh my goodness. Now that is a difficult question. My memory… it's just dreadful, you see. Let me see… surgeries… I had my appendix out when I was young. That’s about all I can recall, truthfully. And illnesses… well, the usual childhood things, I suppose. Nothing serious. I do recall having… pneumonia, many years ago, but that was a long time ago. And, of course, the SLE diagnosis. That was… a difficult time. I'm not sure what else. I’ve been seeing doctors regularly for years, of course, because of the condition. But I can't recall any other major illnesses or surgeries. I apologize.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Glymph. You’ve provided a great deal of useful information already. Knowing about the appendectomy and past pneumonia is helpful. Now, are you currently taking any medications for your SLE or any other conditions?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, medications. A whole host of them, I’m afraid. Let me see… there’s… Plaquenil, that’s one. And… a low dose of prednisone, sometimes. It depends on how I'm feeling. And… oh, dear, what else? I take something for my blood pressure, I believe. And… a vitamin D supplement. And sometimes, when my joints are particularly painful, I take ibuprofen. I apologize, it's all rather a blur! I have a list at home, I’m sure, but I don’t have it with me.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Ms. Glymph. We can verify everything in your chart. Knowing about the Plaquenil, prednisone, blood pressure medication, vitamin D, and ibuprofen is a good start. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, allergies… let me see. No, I don't believe so. I’ve never had any serious allergic reactions. Nothing to medications, food, or anything else that I can recall. I’ve been fortunate in that regard. Sometimes my skin gets a little itchy, but that’s usually just from… dry air, I think. Nothing to worry about. No, no allergies that I know of. I apologize if that’s not helpful!
DOCTOR: That is helpful, Ms. Glymph. Knowing you have no known allergies is very important. Now, I’d like to conduct a brief physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, certainly, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. A physical exam sounds perfectly fine. I trust your judgment. Please, proceed whenever you are ready. I’ll try to be as still as possible.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Glymph. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs first. Take slow, deep breaths for me, please. Your heart sounds regular, and your lung sounds are clear. No wheezing or crackling that I can detect. Now, I’ll check your abdomen. I'm going to gently press on different areas to assess for any tenderness. I do notice some mild tenderness in your lower abdomen, particularly on the left side. It's not sharp pain, but you do tense up a little when I press there. No guarding or rebound tenderness. Finally, I'll check your joints. I notice some mild swelling and tenderness in both wrists, and a slight limitation in range of motion. No visible redness or warmth. Alright, Ms. Glymph. Based on the exam, and what you’ve told me, I suspect your symptoms are related to a flare-up of your SLE, potentially affecting your gastrointestinal system. However, we need to rule out other possibilities. I'd like to order some blood tests, including a complete blood count, an inflammatory marker to assess your SLE activity, a metabolic panel, and a stool test to check for infection or inflammation. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Oh. That… doesn't sound pleasant, all those tests. But if it will help determine what’s going on, then yes, absolutely. Please, do whatever you think is necessary, Doctor. I trust your judgment entirely. A flare-up… that sounds about right, truthfully. It’s just… worrying. But if we can get to the bottom of it, and find a way to feel better, then yes, please order the tests. I do apologize for being a bother.
DOCTOR: You're not a bother at all, Ms. Glymph. It’s my job to help you feel better, and getting a clear diagnosis is the first step. The blood tests and stool test will give us a much better understanding of what’s going on. I will also order a urinalysis, just to be thorough. I’ll have the lab draw the blood samples now, and I’ll give you a container for the stool sample. You can drop that off at the lab at your convenience. Once the results are back – usually within a few days – we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and develop a treatment plan. In the meantime, I recommend you continue to take your medications as prescribed. If you experience any severe abdominal pain, fever over 101°F, or any difficulty breathing, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Oh. Thank you, Doctor. That's… very thorough. And I appreciate the warning about the emergency room. I will be sure to watch for those symptoms. Hmm… a question. Is there anything I can do in the meantime, to alleviate the discomfort? Anything I can eat or avoid? Or any position I should be in? I know you said continue my medications, but… is there anything else?
DOCTOR: That’s a very good question, Ms. Glymph. While we await the test results, there are a few things you can try. First, stick to a bland diet – things like toast, rice, bananas, and applesauce. Avoid anything spicy, greasy, or acidic. Staying hydrated is also important, so drink plenty of fluids. As for position, some people find relief lying on their left side. You can also try a warm compress on your abdomen, but be careful not to burn yourself. Over-the-counter pain relievers like acetaminophen can help with mild discomfort, but avoid ibuprofen or naproxen, as they can sometimes irritate the stomach. Ultimately, it may take some trial and error to find what works best for you. It's important to listen to your body and avoid anything that makes your symptoms worse. Do you have any other questions or concerns I can address before we finish today?
PATIENT: Oh. That's very helpful, Doctor. Thank you. Bland diet, fluids, warm compress… I can certainly manage that. And I’ll stick to acetaminophen. No, I think that’s all for now. You’ve been very thorough, and I appreciate your patience. I’m just… anxious, naturally. But I feel a little better knowing we’re getting to the bottom of it. Thank you again, Doctor Bakan.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Glymph. It's perfectly natural to be anxious, and I’m glad I could provide some reassurance. Please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. The nurse will be in shortly to provide you with the lab requisitions and instructions for the stool sample. Take care, and I look forward to seeing you again soon.
