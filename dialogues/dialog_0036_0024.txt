DOCTOR: Good morning, Kiante. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Bacy. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. I need a letter, actually. A confirmation that I’m able to fly. It’s… a bit complicated, but my insurance company needs it. Medicare, specifically.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. A fit-to-fly letter for Medicare. That's certainly something we can address. To do that properly, I’ll need some more information. Can you tell me a bit about why Medicare is requesting this letter?
PATIENT: Oh, um… it’s because my husband passed away unexpectedly a few months ago, while we were traveling. I want to go visit family overseas, but they need to make sure… well, that I’m healthy enough for the flight, I guess. They’re being extra cautious, naturally.
DOCTOR: I am very sorry to hear about your husband, Kiante. That must have been incredibly difficult, and I understand why Medicare would be requesting this documentation. It’s good you’re thinking of visiting family. To assess your fitness for travel, I’ll need to go through a fairly standard medical history and do a brief physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. That’s perfectly alright. Anything to get this sorted, really. Just… let me know if you need anything specific. I have all the details about my husband’s passing if that’s helpful too.
DOCTOR: That’s kind of you to offer, Kiante. We likely won’t need the specific details of your husband’s passing for the fit-to-fly letter, but I appreciate the thought. Let’s start with your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any chronic medical conditions – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, heart disease, lung problems, or anything else ongoing?
PATIENT: No, nothing chronic. I’ve always been pretty healthy, thankfully. I had a bout of bronchitis a couple of years ago, but that cleared up completely with antibiotics. Other than that… just the usual colds and flu. Oh! And I had my appendix out when I was a teenager, but that was… a long time ago. I don’t think that’s relevant, is it?
DOCTOR: That's good to hear, Kiante. And yes, having your appendix removed as a teenager isn’t directly relevant to this, but I do like to have a complete picture. So, no high blood pressure, diabetes, heart disease, or lung problems currently?
PATIENT: Correct. None of those. I do take a daily multivitamin, and sometimes fish oil, if that matters. I try to eat well, you know? My mother always said a good diet is half the battle.
DOCTOR: Good. Vitamins are helpful. Now, let’s talk about medications. Besides the multivitamin and occasional fish oil, are you currently taking any prescription medications, over-the-counter drugs regularly, or any herbal supplements?
PATIENT: No, nothing else. Just the multivitamin, as I said. I really try to avoid medication unless absolutely necessary. I’ve never been one for taking pills. I get a headache sometimes, but I usually just drink water and rest. That usually does the trick.
DOCTOR: Alright, good. No regular medications. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, insects, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies, thankfully. Not that I’m aware of, anyway. I’ve eaten everything people have put in front of me. I've always been pretty lucky in that department. My family always joked I had a cast-iron stomach.
DOCTOR: Okay, excellent. No known allergies. Now, I just need to ask a few questions about your social history. Do you smoke, use tobacco products, or vape?
PATIENT: No, none of those. Never have. My husband tried smoking once, a long time ago, but he didn’t enjoy it and quit pretty quickly. I’ve always been pretty careful about what I put into my body.
DOCTOR: Alright. Do you drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Just occasionally. Maybe a glass of wine with dinner, every now and then. Nothing heavy, really. I don’t drink regularly, and certainly not to excess. I haven’t had much appetite for anything since… well. But when I do, it’s usually just a small glass of wine.
DOCTOR: Okay, occasional small glass of wine. And finally, do you currently engage in any regular physical activity, like exercise or sports?
PATIENT: I used to go for walks a lot, with my husband. We both enjoyed being outdoors. But… not so much lately. I haven’t been feeling up to it, truthfully. Mostly just… taking it easy. Is that bad?
DOCTOR: That's understandable, Kiante. Absolutely not bad, given the circumstances. It's more important to focus on your well-being right now. Okay, I think I have enough information from the history portion. Now, would you mind if I did a brief physical exam?
PATIENT: No, not at all. Go ahead. Whatever you need to do. I just want to get this letter sorted so I can go and see my family.
DOCTOR: Great. First, I’m going to check your blood pressure and pulse. Your blood pressure is 122/78, which is excellent, and your pulse is 72, also good. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are normal, clear. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. I’m also going to quickly check your ears, nose, and throat. Ears are clear. Nose is clear. Throat is clear. Finally, I'm going to take a quick look at your neurological function. Can you follow my finger with your eyes without moving your head?
PATIENT: Yes, I can. Is that alright? I’m trying to keep still.
DOCTOR: Good. Excellent tracking. Now, can you squeeze my hands as hard as you can?
PATIENT: Like this? Is that too hard? I didn’t want to be too weak.
DOCTOR: That's perfect, Kiante. Good strength bilaterally. Okay, everything appears normal during the physical exam. Given your history and the results of the exam, I don't see any immediate medical contraindications to air travel. I'm happy to write the letter confirming your fitness to fly for Medicare. Will you need the original, or will a digital copy suffice?
PATIENT: Oh, that's wonderful! A digital copy would be fantastic, if that's possible. It's easier for me to send to the insurance company. Thank you so much, Doctor. You've really put my mind at ease.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Kiante. Here you go. I've included a statement confirming your medical suitability for air travel, dated today, August 2nd, 2025. I’ve also noted that you have no known contraindications to travel. I'll also send a digital copy to the email address we have on file. Do you have any questions for me before we finish up?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. You’ve been very thorough, and I appreciate your kindness, Doctor. Really, thank you. I can finally start making arrangements to see my family.
