DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Bigger. I'm Dr. Voytek. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning to you. Bigger is the name. They sent me here... something about the place I used to work. Dust, they said. Lots of dust. I feel fine, though. Always been strong, you know? But they insisted.
DOCTOR: Right, I see the note about your previous employment and the potential dust exposure. That’s good you're feeling well, Mr. Bigger. Just to be thorough, since it was recommended we take a look, let's talk a little bit more about what’s been going on. When you say “lots of dust,” can you tell me what kind of work you were doing that exposed you?
PATIENT: Work? Underground. Mining. Big machines, digging things out of the earth. Coal mostly, but sometimes...other stuff. Lots of rock. And yes, lots of dust. It was...dirty work. You wouldn't like it. What does this have to do with me feeling fine, eh? They just waste people's time, these people.
DOCTOR: Okay, mining. That's helpful to know. It's good that you're feeling fine now, but long-term dust exposure, even if you feel okay, can sometimes lead to problems with your lungs. That's why they sent you over. Just routine, really. To get a better idea of what's going on, could you tell me if you've had any cough, even a little one?
PATIENT: Cough? No. Never been much of a cougher. Strong lungs, I tell you. Always have been. I used to be able to run for days. Not so much now, getting old, but still. No cough. Not a single one. They worry too much, these doctors. What kind of problems? Like what? You tell me.
DOCTOR: Okay, no cough, that's good. Some of the things we worry about with dust exposure are things like chronic bronchitis, or a condition called pneumoconiosis – sometimes called “black lung” if it's from coal dust. It can make it harder to breathe over time. We'll need to do a quick listen to your lungs and probably get a chest X-ray just to make sure everything is clear. Before we do that, have you ever been diagnosed with asthma, emphysema, or any other lung problems?
PATIENT: Asthma? Emphysema? No! What do you think I am, a weakling? I told you, I worked in a mine. You don't get asthma working in a mine! It's... it's dusty, not airy! Never had any problems with my lungs. Not one. I'm a strong man. Always have been. Listen to them, they just want to charge you money. Is that X-ray going to cost me anything?
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. You're very clear about your health history, and that's good. The X-ray is covered by your insurance, Mr. Bigger. It's just a precaution. Let's just do a quick exam, just to be thorough. I'm going to listen to your breathing with my stethoscope, and check your oxygen levels with a little clip on your finger. It won't take long. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Fine, fine. Do what you have to do. But I'm telling you, it's a waste of time. Oxygen... what's wrong with the air in here? It seems fine to me. But go ahead. Get it over with. I have things to do, you know. A man doesn't have all day. And be quick about it. Don't poke me too much with those things.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Bigger. Just relax and breathe normally. I'm just listening to your lungs on both sides. Okay…your oxygen saturation is 95%, which is good. I do hear some mild crackles in the lower lobes of both lungs, especially when you take a deep breath. It's subtle, but worth noting given your history. Nothing alarming right now, but it does suggest some possible irritation or inflammation. Do you ever get short of breath, even when walking slowly or doing light activity?
PATIENT: Crackles? What are crackles? Sounds bad. Inflammation... like what? You're scaring an old man now. Short of breath? Not really. Maybe a little when I climb the stairs, but I am 86, you know! Stairs are hard! I used to run up them two at a time. But now... not so much. You mean to tell me all this dust did something? I thought my lungs were strong. Are you going to give me a medicine?
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Bigger. Crackles are just small popping sounds I hear with the stethoscope. They can happen with lots of things, not just lung problems. And yes, it's common to get a little short of breath with age and climbing stairs. Given your history of dust exposure and those mild crackles, I'd like to get a chest X-ray just to get a clearer picture of what’s going on. It will help us rule out anything serious. And, depending on what the X-ray shows, we can discuss possible treatments if needed. Before we order that, do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. Never had any allergies. Strong man, remember? I eat anything. I drink anything. I don't get sick easily. But this X-ray... is it safe? All that radiation... I read things about that radiation. You're sure it won't hurt me? And how long will it take? I don't like waiting. And will I have to pay for it? You said my insurance… but still. You doctors always have so many questions.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Bigger. You're right to ask about the radiation. The amount of radiation from a chest X-ray is very low – it's about the same as the natural background radiation you get from the environment over a few days. It’s considered very safe, and the benefits of seeing what's going on in your lungs far outweigh the small risk. The X-ray itself will only take a few minutes. We'll send you over to the radiology department, and they’ll take care of it. As I mentioned, your insurance should cover it, but we can double-check with them if you're concerned. Before we proceed, could you tell me about any medications you are currently taking, even over-the-counter ones or vitamins?
PATIENT: Medications? Let me think... I take a little something for my blood pressure, you know, keeps it from going too high. Name is... amlodipine, I think. And sometimes, when my joints get sore, I take some ibuprofen. You know, the orange pills. That's about it. I try to stay natural, you know? Don’t like too many of those pills. Makes you feel weak. So blood pressure and a little ibuprofen now and then. Is that enough questions for you yet?
DOCTOR: Okay, amlodipine for blood pressure and ibuprofen as needed. That’s helpful. Alright, Mr. Bigger, given your history, the mild crackles I heard, and the fact that you worked in the mines, I’m going to order a chest X-ray to get a better look at your lungs. I’m also going to order a pulmonary function test. That just means you'll blow into a tube to see how well your lungs are working. We'll get those ordered now, and I’ll have the radiology department contact you to schedule them. After we have the results, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and decide on the best course of action. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Blow into a tube? What for? What are you trying to find? You're making me nervous now, doctor. Is something wrong? I told you, I feel fine! But if you insist… alright, fine. Blow into a tube, X-ray… just get it over with. But if it's nothing, I'm telling everyone. Doctors waste people’s time, that’s what I’m saying. And make sure they tell me when I can come. I don’t have all day to be sitting in waiting rooms. And don't forget, my insurance… you double check that for me. Now, can I go? I’m getting tired.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Bigger. Here are the orders. The radiology department will call you to schedule both tests. I’ve also made a note to double-check your insurance coverage. The tests will give us a better understanding of your lung function, and help us rule out anything serious. It’s standard procedure given your history, and I want to make sure you're as healthy as possible. I’ll have my assistant call you in a couple of days to check on the scheduling and discuss the results when they’re available. You can go now. If you experience any shortness of breath or chest pain before your appointments, please don't hesitate to go to the emergency room. .
PATIENT: Fine, fine. I'll go. But don't expect me to be happy about this. And I better not get a huge bill. You hear me? A huge bill.
