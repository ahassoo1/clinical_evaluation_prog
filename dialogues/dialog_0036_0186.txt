DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kingan. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Bacy. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just Lamark is fine. Yeah, well, I'm trying out for a team. Need to get a check-up, make sure I'm still good to go, you know? Old man trying to keep up with the young bucks.
DOCTOR: That's great to hear, Lamark! It’s wonderful you’re staying active. And absolutely, a check-up is a smart idea before starting any new physical activity. To get a better picture of your overall health, could you tell me a little more about the team you’re trying out for and what kind of physical demands it involves?
PATIENT: It's a… well, it's a sort of… Mongolian wrestling team. Not professional, more like a local thing. Lots of grappling, pushing, lifting… you know, the usual. It's pretty rough, actually. More demanding than it looks. I haven’t done it seriously in a few years, though. Trying to get back into shape.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mongolian wrestling – that sounds physically challenging! Good to know. And returning after a few years is important information. Have you experienced any pain, injuries, or limitations that have prevented you from being as active as you’d like recently?
PATIENT: Hmm… not really prevented me, no. Just… aches. Old man aches, you know? My knees get a bit creaky sometimes, and my back isn't what it used to be. Nothing serious enough to stop me completely, but I definitely feel it after a good workout. I’ve just been trying to work through it.
DOCTOR: Okay, "aches in knees and back, worse with exertion." That’s helpful to know. When did you first start noticing these aches, and have they been getting progressively worse, or do they come and go?
PATIENT: Oh, jeez, when did I first notice? Probably… a couple years ago, I guess. Started slow, just a little stiffness. It comes and goes, mostly. Bad after a workout, better after a few days of rest. Lately, it’s been… sticking around a little longer, maybe. That’s why I figured I should get it checked out before I throw my back out trying to impress the young guys.
DOCTOR: That’s a very sensible idea, Lamark. It's good you're proactive about this. Besides the aches, have you noticed any swelling, redness, or warmth in your knees or back?
PATIENT: No, no swelling or redness. Nothing like that. Just… sore. Really, really sore sometimes. And stiff. Like an old door hinge. Is that… is that a thing doctors even care about? I’m probably making a fuss over nothing.
DOCTOR: It’s absolutely a thing doctors care about, Lamark. Pain and stiffness are important symptoms, and we want to figure out what's causing them. It’s good you’re describing it so well – "old door hinge" is a very helpful image! Now, let's talk a bit more about your overall health. Do you have any medical conditions that you’ve been diagnosed with, like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Nope. Nothing like that. I've been pretty lucky, I guess. I eat okay, try to stay active… well, trying to, anyway. No high blood pressure, no diabetes, nothing the doctors have ever told me about. I haven’t really been to a doctor in… well, a while. That's probably why I'm here now, right? Old man finally breaking down.
DOCTOR: It's not about "breaking down," Lamark! It’s smart to get a check-up, especially before increasing your activity level. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Nope. Never had surgery. Never been in the hospital. Knock on wood. I've twisted an ankle a few times playing wrestling, but nothing that needed a doctor or anything. Just wrapped it and iced it. I'm a tough old bird, you know? Or I used to be. Maybe I’m not anymore.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear, Lamark. No surgeries or hospitalizations is excellent. Now, thinking about your family, do any of your close relatives – parents, siblings, children – have any significant medical conditions, like heart disease, diabetes, arthritis, or cancer?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. My dad… he had some heart trouble when he got older. Needed a pacemaker, I think. And my mom… she had arthritis in her hands, pretty bad. Lots of pain. That’s about it, I think. My brother's healthy as a horse, and I don’t really keep in touch with my sister, so I wouldn’t know. Is that helpful? I don't know a whole lot about family medical history. We didn’t really talk about it much.
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful, Lamark, thank you. Knowing about your parents’ health conditions is important. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Nope. Nothing. I don’t like taking pills if I can avoid it. Just… plain old water and a little bit of tea. Maybe some ibuprofen if my knees are really bothering me, but that’s it. I don’t really believe in all that medicine stuff unless I absolutely have to.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. And finally, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope. Not that I know of. I eat pretty much anything. Never had a reaction to anything. I’m pretty boring that way, I guess. Can we… can we get this over with now? I’m starting to feel a little stiff just sitting here. I'd like to get back to training.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Lamark. We're almost finished with the questions. Just a few more things, and then we’ll do a quick physical exam. Now, do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Nope. Never smoked a cigarette in my life. Don’t like the smell. I’ll have a beer with dinner sometimes, but that’s it. And no, definitely no drugs. I'm an old man, not a… well, you know. Just trying to stay healthy and wrestle a little. Really. Can we please just check if my knees are going to fall off?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Lamark. I understand your eagerness to get back to training. No, no drugs, occasional beer – good to know. Alright, let's move on to a quick physical exam. I'm just going to listen to your heart and lungs, and then I’ll check your knees and back for any tenderness or limitations in movement. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, yeah, that's fine. Just get it over with. The sooner I know if I'm falling apart, the sooner I can decide if I need to hang up my boots. Just… be gentle, okay? My knees aren't what they used to be.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, I will be very gentle. First, I'm just going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a few deep breaths for me. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Now, let’s take a look at your knees. Could you please bend your knees for me, as comfortably as you can?
PATIENT: Ugh… there we go. That’s about as far as they go these days. Feels a little… crunchy, you know? Like sandpaper rubbing together. And a little bit sore. Especially on the inside. There. Right there.
DOCTOR: Okay, I feel some tenderness on the medial side of your right knee. And I do feel some crepitus – that “crunchy” feeling you described – when you bend it. Now, let's check the left knee. Please bend that one for me.
PATIENT: Not as bad as the other one, but still… something's not right. Feels a little tight. Not as crunchy, but definitely not as flexible. It's just… old, you know? Like an old machine that needs oiling. Can we just… get to the back now? This is making me nervous.
DOCTOR: Okay, less tenderness on the left knee, as you said. Now, let’s move on to your back. Could you please stand up for me and bend forward slowly, as far as you comfortably can?
PATIENT: Oof… there we go. That's about as far as I can go without… you know. Feels tight. Really tight. And a little bit sore. Mostly in the lower part of my back. Right around here. Feels like something’s pulled. I probably just slept wrong. Or maybe I overdid it when I was helping my nephew move furniture last week. I don’t know. I just… get old aches, you know? Can we just… what do you think? Am I going to need a wheelchair?
DOCTOR: Okay, I feel some muscle tightness and tenderness in your lower back. It doesn’t seem to be any sharp pain, which is good. No signs of any neurological issues at this time. Based on this quick exam, it seems like you have some osteoarthritis in your knees, primarily on the right side, and some muscle strain or tightness in your lower back. It doesn't appear to be anything that requires immediate intervention, like a wheelchair! However, we should discuss a plan to help manage your symptoms and prevent further injury. To get a better understanding of the extent of the arthritis, I recommend getting an X-ray of both knees. Also, depending on how your back feels in the next few days, we could consider some physical therapy. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: X-rays… physical therapy… ugh. Sounds expensive. Look, can't I just… ice it and take some ibuprofen? I really just want to get back to training. Is that going to make it worse? I’m not trying to be difficult, I just… I don’t have a lot of time or money for all this. I’m an old man, not an athlete. Well, a semi-retired athlete, anyway. Can we just… try the ice and ibuprofen first? And if it doesn’t get better, then we do the fancy stuff? That sound reasonable? Please?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Lamark. And you're right to consider your time and finances. While ice and ibuprofen can certainly help manage the symptoms temporarily, they won't address the underlying causes of the arthritis or muscle strain. It's like putting a bandage on a broken bone – it might feel better for a little while, but it won’t fix the problem. However, I'm happy to start with a conservative approach. We can try ice and ibuprofen for a week or two. If your pain doesn’t improve, or if it gets worse, then we can revisit the X-rays and physical therapy. Here’s what I recommend: apply ice to your knees for 15-20 minutes at a time, several times a day. And take ibuprofen as directed on the label, but be careful not to exceed the recommended dosage. Also, it’s important to avoid any activities that aggravate your pain. So, for the next couple of weeks, I recommend taking a break from wrestling. That’s the hardest part, I know, but it’s crucial for allowing your body to heal. Does that sound like a plan you’re comfortable with?
PATIENT: A break from wrestling… ugh. Fine. Fine, you win. Ice, ibuprofen, no wrestling. For two weeks. But if it doesn’t get better… I’m blaming you. Just kidding… mostly. So… am I good to go? Can I finally leave? I’ve got to go tell my team I’m… resting. They're not going to be happy. .
DOCTOR: Alright, Lamark. You're good to go. Remember, if your pain doesn’t improve, or if it gets worse, please schedule a follow-up appointment with me right away. We can discuss the X-rays and physical therapy at that time. Here’s a handout with instructions on how to manage knee pain. I wish you a speedy recovery, and I hope you get back to wrestling soon. Don't push yourself too hard, and listen to your body. Thank you for coming in today. Have a good day, and take care of yourself.
