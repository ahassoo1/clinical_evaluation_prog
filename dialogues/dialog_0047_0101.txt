DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Popova. I'm Dr. Press. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Call me Aldine, please. Well, I’ve been gettin’ these headaches… right at the back of my head. Been botherin’ me for a little bit now. Not constant, but they come and go. Feels like a tight band, almost.
DOCTOR: Alright, Aldine. Headaches, you say. And how long, precisely, has “a little bit now” been?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think… maybe three weeks now? Started right after my wife and I got back from visiting my daughter in Florida. It’s funny, ‘cause I was so happy to see her, didn’t have a headache then. Started a few days after we got home, I reckon. Maybe a week after, actually. Time flies when you’re havin’ fun, y’know?
DOCTOR: Right. Three weeks, post-Florida trip. And you describe it as a “tight band”… is it a constant pressure, or does it come and go in waves?
PATIENT: It definitely comes and goes, Doctor. Not somethin’ I’m feelin’ all the time. More like… a sharp squeeze now and then. Then it’s gone for a while. It's not the worst pain, mind you, but enough to make me stop and notice it. Especially when I’m bendin’ over, workin’ on someone’s feet. Makes it a bit harder to concentrate.
DOCTOR: You work on people’s feet?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I’m a manicurist and pedicurist. Been doin’ it for… goodness, over fifty years now! Started right after I left school. Used to be mostly women, but plenty of men gettin’ pedicures these days, too. It's a good job, keeps me busy. But bendin’ over for long stretches… that’s when I notice the headache the most. Still better than sittin’ still, though!
DOCTOR: Right. Manicurist and pedicurist… fifty years. And you said it’s worse when bending over. Have you noticed any other symptoms alongside the headaches?
PATIENT: Let me think… not really, Doctor. No dizziness, no blurry vision, no nausea or anything like that. Sometimes my neck feels a bit stiff, but that could just be from bendin' over all day, y’know? And I've been a little more tired lately, but that could be my age catchin’ up to me! Eighty-seven years is a long time, you gotta expect a few aches and pains.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's just take a look at your neck and upper back. Any tenderness here?
PATIENT: Ooh, yes, right there. A little bit. Not sharp pain, but definitely… sensitive. Like a knot, almost. And a bit here too, on this side. It feels tighter there than on this side. Been tryin’ to stretch it out, but it doesn’t seem to help much.
DOCTOR: Okay, and can you turn your head to the left… and now to the right?
PATIENT: Feels a little stiff on this side, Doctor. Not terrible, but not as smooth as it used to be. Just a little… resistance, y’know? Feels like somethin’’s catchin’ a bit.
DOCTOR: Right. So, some neck stiffness and tenderness. And the headaches are still described as a “tight band” at the back of the head, worse with bending and triggered after your trip to Florida. Have you had any changes in your vision lately?
PATIENT: No changes to my vision, Doctor. Still seein’ just fine, thank you very much! Read the paper every mornin’, do my crossword… everything’s clear as a bell. No blurry spots, no double vision, nothin’ like that. It’s funny you ask though… my wife, bless her heart, she’s been complainin’ about her eyesight lately. Might need a new prescription, she thinks. But me? I'm alright. Still sharp as a tack!
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you currently take any medications, Aldine?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, nothin’ regular. I try to stay away from pills if I can. I take a bit of ibuprofen now and then for aches and pains, but that's about it. Mostly just try to keep movin’, stay busy. That’s what keeps me goin’, you know? And a good cup of tea helps, too!
DOCTOR: And you mentioned your wife. Any significant medical history in your family?
PATIENT: Well, my mother, bless her soul, she had high blood pressure. And my brother, he had a touch of diabetes. My wife… she’s got arthritis in her knees, keeps her pretty slow these days. And she worries a lot, which I reckon isn't good for her health either! But nothin' major, really. We're a pretty sturdy bunch, all things considered. Lived a long time, most of us. Though, my aunt on my father's side, she had terrible migraines. Real bad ones. But that was a long time ago, and I don't think I inherited that particular problem.
DOCTOR: Alright, Aldine. Given your history, the physical exam, and your age, my assessment is likely tension headaches related to muscle strain in your neck and upper back, possibly exacerbated by your occupation and posture. The fact that it started after your trip could be coincidence, or related to changes in your routine. We can try a few things. I recommend over-the-counter ibuprofen as needed, but avoid prolonged use. More importantly, I'd like you to focus on improving your posture and taking frequent breaks throughout the day to stretch your neck and back muscles.
PATIENT: That sounds… reasonable, Doctor. Stretching, yeah, I can try that. Been meanin’ to, actually. And I suppose I could be more careful about how I’m bendin' over. Easier said than done, though, after fifty years! Is there anything else I should be lookin’ out for? Anything that would mean I need to come back sooner? I don’t want to bother you unless I really have to.
DOCTOR: If the headaches worsen significantly, become constant, are accompanied by fever, weakness, numbness, or any changes in your vision, then come back immediately. Also, if the ibuprofen isn’t providing relief, or you develop any other concerning symptoms, don’t hesitate to seek medical attention. For now, let’s try this conservative approach and see if it helps. Do you have any questions for me?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think that covers everything. Conservative approach sounds good. I'm not one for fancy pills unless I really need 'em. Just gonna try to stretch a bit more and be more mindful of my posture, like you said. Thank you for takin' the time to listen to an old man's aches and pains. I appreciate it.
DOCTOR: Alright. Just keep an eye on things. And if anything changes, don’t hesitate to call. .
