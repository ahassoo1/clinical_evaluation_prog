DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Carlotta. I’m Dr. Gorga. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Hmm… my wife… she want… baby. We old, you know? But she say… maybe. I forget… she make appointment. For… make baby happen? It is good thing, yes? I just… come with her.
DOCTOR: Right… okay. So, your wife is hoping to get pregnant?
PATIENT: Yes, yes! That is right. She want little one. But… we… not so young anymore. I think… she worry maybe… hard to do. I don’t understand all the… things. She explain, but… my head, it is slow these days.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's perfectly normal to have questions, and it’s good she’s thinking this through. Okay, so she's concerned about the possibility of difficulty getting pregnant due to your ages?
PATIENT: Yes. Ages. That is… the problem, yes? I think she say… eggs? And… something about me… make them… move? I forget the word. It is okay if we just… talk? I not good with… fancy words. She read a lot of papers, but I… I just make little things. Metal and plastic.
DOCTOR: Metal and plastic, alright. Well, let's stick to simple talk then. You’re right to bring this up. Age does affect both the eggs and… the sperm, which is what helps the eggs move, as you said. Has your wife had any trouble getting pregnant before?
PATIENT: Trouble… hmm. Long time ago, we… try. But… not happen. Then… we say okay, maybe enough. This… new idea. She say… new doctor, new… chances? I think she go to different doctor before. But I… I don't remember who. It was… many years ago. Before the little shop.
DOCTOR: Okay, so she's had some previous attempts at getting pregnant. And a different doctor in the past… alright. Has she been having regular periods?
PATIENT: Periods… for her? Yes, I think so. She… complain sometimes if not come. But mostly… regular. She know… woman things. I don’t ask too much. She tell me if something wrong, yes? She is strong woman. Always take care of things.
DOCTOR: That's good. And are either of you currently taking any medications, or do you have any allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Medications… hmm. I take something for… water. My legs swell. Old man problems, you know? Little blue pill. That is all. And allergies… no, I don't think so. Never had problem with… flowers or food. My wife… maybe something. She get… sniffles sometimes. But not bad. She can tell you better.
DOCTOR: Alright, a medication for swelling in your legs. And possible allergies for your wife – good to know. Let’s talk a little about your overall health. Do you have any history of serious illnesses, like heart problems, diabetes, or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: High… blood pressure? I think so. Doctor told me… many years ago. I take pill for that too. And… something with my heart. Not bad, he say. Just… old heart. I walk slow now. Not run like young man. I eat… okay food. Mostly. My wife… she cook good food. She always worry I not eat enough.
DOCTOR: Okay, so history of high blood pressure and some heart issues… Do you smoke, or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Smoke? No, never. Bad for you. My father… he smoke. Very bad cough. I no like. Alcohol… sometimes. Little glass of wine with dinner. Not much. My wife, she like little wine too. But not every night. We… not big drinkers.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, it sounds like you're generally in okay shape for your age, considering your history. To get a better picture of what’s going on, and to see if getting pregnant is a viable option, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, just to check your blood pressure and heart rate. And then we should probably get some blood work done for both of you. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Physical… exam? Yes, okay. That is fine. Blood work… a little poke? I don't like needles. But… if you say so. For baby… I do what I have to do. My wife… she will be happy. Just… not too much poking, yes?
DOCTOR: I promise, we’ll keep the poking to a minimum. First, let's just check your blood pressure and listen to your heart. Please sit up straight and relax. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, 145/90. Heart sounds… regular, but a slight murmur, as you mentioned. Lungs are clear. Any swelling in your legs today?
PATIENT: Swelling… yes, a little. Not bad as before. But… always little bit. Especially at the end of day. When I sit too long. My wife… she massage my legs. Very good massage. It help. Sometimes, I put my feet up. That help too. But… it always come back. It is old man problem.
DOCTOR: Okay, some continued swelling despite elevation and massage. Alright. So, with your history and these findings, it's good we’re looking into this. For your wife, we’ll need to do some blood tests to check her hormone levels and egg reserve. And it might be worth consulting with a fertility specialist to get their expert opinion, given your ages and previous attempts at conception. Would you be open to that?
PATIENT: Fertility… specialist? Hmm. More doctors? I… I don't know. My wife… she will decide. She good with doctors. I just… follow her. If she think it help… then yes. I trust her. But… I hope not too many needles for her. She not like them either.
DOCTOR: Of course. We’ll take things at your wife's pace. And we'll certainly try to minimize any discomfort. I’ll write down a referral to a specialist, and we can discuss the blood work orders for both of you. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: Questions… hmm. Not right now. Maybe… maybe my wife will have questions. She always think of everything. I… just hope it is possible. We want little one. It is… good dream. Thank you, Doctor. For… listening.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Carlotta. I understand your feelings, and we'll do everything we can to help. I'll have the nurse come in with the referral and blood work orders. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns.
