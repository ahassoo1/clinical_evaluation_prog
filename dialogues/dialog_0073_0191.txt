DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Shaub. I'm Dr. Korrell. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, I requested to come in… to get tested for HIV. It's… a personal thing, really. I just want to know my status.
DOCTOR: I see. A proactive approach is… commendable. Though, frankly, most people come in with something presenting. But alright. Before we proceed with testing, I need to ask a few questions, if you don't mind. It's standard procedure, and helps me understand your risk factors. Have you had any recent… encounters that might necessitate this testing?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. Standard procedure, you said. I understand. Recent… encounters. Hmm. Well, my husband and I… we’ve been together for a long time, over forty years now. But… we haven’t been exclusive for the last few months. I suppose that's what prompted this. It's been… a while since we discussed things openly, and I felt I should be certain. It’s better to be safe, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: Forty years is… significant. And you’re only now addressing this. Right. “Better to be safe” is… sensible, I suppose. To clarify – when you say “not exclusive,” can you elaborate on the nature of these encounters?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. It’s… difficult to discuss. It wasn’t… frequent, Doctor. Perhaps three times in the last six months. And… it was with someone I met through a social group. A friend of a friend, really. We… connected. It was a mistake, truthfully. I deeply regret it. But now… I need to know if I’ve put myself at risk. I haven't used any protection, I’m afraid. That was… foolish of me, I realize that now.
DOCTOR: “Foolish” is a… strong word. But yes, unprotected encounters do carry risk. Alright. Have you noticed any… unusual symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms? No, not really. I feel… fine, generally. A bit tired, perhaps, but that could be my age. And the weather has been terribly hot, hasn't it? I haven't had any fever, no rashes, no swollen glands… nothing that I would specifically associate with… anything. I just want peace of mind, Doctor. That's all.
DOCTOR: Alright. Peace of mind is…understandable. We'll proceed with the HIV testing. It's a blood draw, and we'll need to send it to the lab. Results typically take about a week. In the meantime, I’d like to perform a basic physical exam, just to rule out any other potential issues, and document a baseline. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly alright, Doctor. A physical exam is sensible. Whatever you think is best, truly. A week… that feels like a long time to wait, but I understand. A baseline, you said? Yes, please. I’m ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Very well. If you could just step over here and lie down, we’ll start with your vital signs – blood pressure, pulse, temperature. Then we’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and a quick abdominal exam. Nothing extensive, just a standard check.
PATIENT: Alright. It’s been… a long time since I’ve had a full check-up. I hope I remember how to do this! Just let me know if I need to do anything special.
DOCTOR: Don’t worry, I’ll guide you. First, let’s take your blood pressure. Relax your arm, please. 140 over 90. A little elevated, but not alarming. Pulse is 78, regular. Temperature is 98.6. Heart sounds are… normal. No murmurs or irregularities detected. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. No wheezing or crackles. Abdomen is soft, non-tender. No masses detected. Overall, your physical exam is… within normal limits, aside from the slightly elevated blood pressure, which could be situational. Now, let’s proceed with the blood draw for the HIV test. It will only be a moment.
PATIENT: That’s… reassuring to hear, Doctor. The elevated blood pressure… it’s probably just the anxiety, I expect. I do worry easily. A blood draw is fine, yes. Do you need me to roll up my sleeve? And… is there anything I should be doing while you draw the blood? Taking deep breaths, perhaps? I always forget these things.
DOCTOR: Anxiety is a…common contributor. Yes, rolling up your sleeve is perfect. And taking deep breaths will help. Try to relax your arm as much as possible. I’m going to apply a tourniquet now, you’ll feel a slight pressure. Just a quick pinch, and then we’ll be done. There. All finished. Just hold this gauze pad on the site for a few minutes to stop the bleeding. Alright. That wasn’t so bad, was it?
PATIENT: No, that wasn’t bad at all, Doctor. A little pinch, as you said. It stopped bleeding quickly. I’m… relieved that’s over. Now we just… wait. A week, you said? Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very kind. And patient with my… anxieties.
DOCTOR: A week, yes. The lab results will be sent directly to my office. I’ll have my nurse contact you as soon as they're available. In the meantime, I would advise… avoiding any further risky behaviors. Is there anything else I can address for you today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don’t think so. Just… the results, when they come. I trust your nurse will contact me. Avoiding further… risky behaviors. Yes, I understand. That won’t be a problem. Thank you again, Doctor Korrell. You’ve put my mind at ease, at least a little. I appreciate your time. I’ll… see you again in a week, then. Or, rather, I’ll hear from you.
DOCTOR: Very well. You may… wait to hear from my office. And Ms. Shaub?
