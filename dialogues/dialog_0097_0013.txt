DOCTOR: Hi Dondre, welcome to the clinic. It's good to meet you. I'm Dr. Georgiou. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good day to you, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, it’s…it’s my water. I have trouble… getting it all out when I go to the bathroom. It feels like there’s always a little bit left, you know? It’s been happenin’ for a little while now.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. You're having difficulty completely emptying your bladder. It feels like you retain some urine after urinating, and this has been going on for a bit. Can you tell me a little more about how long this has been happening?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It’s hard to say exactly. Maybe… six months or so? It started slow, just a little bit of… left behind, you could say. But it’s gotten more noticeable lately. Not every time, but most times. It's… worryin' me some. I don't like feelin' like there's always somethin' still in there.
DOCTOR: Okay, six months, gradually worsening, happening most of the time, but not every time. That’s helpful. And you said it's worrying you. Is it causing you any discomfort – pain, burning, or a sense of urgency?
PATIENT: No, not really pain. Not like a sharp pain, no. It's more… a fullness. A heavy feelin' after I try to go. And sometimes, a little bit of… I don’t know how to say… a strainin'. I have to push a little more than I used to. That’s about it, really. Not burnin’ or anything like that. Just… uncomfortable. And the worry, of course. My wife… she always took care of these things. It’s different now.
DOCTOR: I understand. A feeling of fullness, some straining, and worry, especially with the change in your routine. It's completely understandable to be concerned when things feel different, and it's good you're bringing this to my attention. Now, to get a clearer picture, could you describe your typical urination pattern?
PATIENT: Well… I usually go… maybe four or five times a day. Not too much different than before, I don’t think. And… one or two times at night. Sometimes none, sometimes one. It depends. The stream… it’s not as strong as it used to be, I reckon. It starts okay, but it kinda… tapers off before I'm finished. That's when I feel like there's still some left. I don’t rush it, try to take my time.
DOCTOR: Okay, four to five times a day, one or two times at night, stream starting okay but tapering off, and that’s when you notice the retention. That’s very helpful. Have you noticed any changes in the color or smell of your urine?
PATIENT: Hmm… now that you mention it… sometimes it’s a little darker. Not real dark, but not clear as it used to be. And… yeah, sometimes the smell is a little stronger. I thought it was just somethin' I ate, to be honest. Now that I think about it though, it's been happenin' more often lately. I mostly drink water, but I do have juice with breakfast sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, sometimes darker urine and a stronger smell, more recently. That could be related to dehydration, but it’s good we’re noting it. Do you have any other symptoms at all?
PATIENT: Let me think… No, not really. I sleep okay, eat okay. I don't have a fever or anything like that. My back… it gets a little stiff sometimes, but that’s just gettin’ old, I reckon. I don't have any pain in my side, and I haven’t noticed any blood in my water. It’s just… the fullness and the trouble emptyin’ my bladder. That’s about it, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, no fever, no back pain, no blood in your urine. Just the fullness and difficulty emptying your bladder. That's good to know. Now, let's talk a little bit about your medical history. Do you have any known medical conditions like diabetes, prostate problems, or any other issues I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Well, I had high blood pressure for a while, but I take a pill for it, keeps it under control. And… I had a surgery on my knee a few years back. Other than that… not really. My wife… she always kept track of these things. She said I was healthy enough for an old man, haha. I don’t think I’ve ever had trouble with my prostate. Never had a test for it, if that’s what you mean.
DOCTOR: Okay, high blood pressure managed with medication, and a previous knee surgery. No known prostate problems, and no prostate testing. And you haven’t been officially diagnosed with diabetes?
PATIENT: No, ma’am. Never been told I have diabetes. I used to be a fisherman, you know? Lots of activity. Ate pretty healthy, mostly fish and berries. My wife always made sure of that. She was a good woman. Now… I just try to eat what I can. Sometimes I have a sweet snack, but not too much.
DOCTOR: Okay, no diagnosis of diabetes. I understand about your wife. It sounds like she was very health-conscious, and it’s good you’re still trying to maintain a healthy lifestyle. Do you currently take any other medications besides the blood pressure pill?
PATIENT: Let me see… just the one for my blood pressure. Lisinopril, I think it’s called. And sometimes I take a little somethin’ for my arthritis, when it’s real bad. Just over-the-counter, though. Ibuprofen, maybe? I don’t take it every day. Only when my knee or my hands are achin'.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril for blood pressure and occasional Ibuprofen for arthritis. And do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, ma’am. Not that I know of. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything. My wife always said I was a tough old bird, haha. She used to tease me about it. I can eat anything, take anything, pretty much. Never had a problem.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. That's good to know. Alright, Dondre, I'm going to do a quick physical exam. I'll listen to your abdomen, check your prostate with a digital rectal exam – I'll explain that briefly before we do it, and check your lower extremities. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: A physical exam, you say? Well… I suppose so. I ain’t thrilled about the… the prostate exam, but if you think it’s necessary, I trust your judgment, Doctor. You explain it to me, like you said, and we'll get it done. I just want to figure out what's goin' on.
DOCTOR: Okay, I appreciate your trust. The digital rectal exam allows me to feel the size and shape of your prostate. It can help me identify any enlargement or tenderness. It's a quick exam, but it can be a little uncomfortable. I'll explain everything as I go. First, I’m going to listen to your abdomen with my stethoscope. This helps me to assess your bladder and kidneys. Sounds normal so far. Now, I'll need you to lie on your side. We'll proceed with the digital rectal exam then. Are you comfortable lying on your left side?
PATIENT: Left side is fine, Doctor. Always slept on my left side, truth be told. Just let me get situated here… Go ahead when you’re ready. I’m a bit nervous, to be honest. But I’m ready.
DOCTOR: Okay, Dondre, I’m going to use some lubricant and gently insert a gloved, lubricated finger into your rectum. This will allow me to feel your prostate. It may feel a bit of pressure or discomfort, but it should be brief. Take some deep breaths and try to relax. Okay… I’m feeling your prostate now. It feels… slightly enlarged, and a little bit firm. Not dramatically so, but it’s worth noting. No obvious nodules or areas of tenderness, which is good. Alright, that's done. The exam itself wasn’t painful, I hope?
PATIENT: Well… it wasn’t terrible, Doctor. Not comfortable, exactly, but I’ve had worse. A little bit of pressure, like you said. Glad it’s over with, though. Enlarged, you say? What does that mean, exactly? Is that what’s causin’ my trouble?
DOCTOR: Okay, I'm glad it wasn't too bad. An enlarged prostate, also known as benign prostatic hyperplasia or BPH, is common as men age. It means the prostate gland has grown larger, which can sometimes press on the urethra – the tube that carries urine out of the bladder – making it difficult to urinate. It could be contributing to your symptoms. However, it's important to rule out other possibilities. I'd like to order a urine analysis and a PSA blood test. The urine analysis will check for infection or other abnormalities. The PSA test measures the level of prostate-specific antigen, which can be elevated in cases of prostate cancer, but can also be elevated due to BPH or other factors. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Urine analysis and a blood test… alright, that sounds reasonable, Doctor. If that's what you think is best. I want to know what’s goin’ on, and if these tests can help, then let’s do ‘em. Infection, you say? I hadn’t thought about that.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. We'll get those ordered right away. The lab is just down the hall, and the nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood and collect a urine sample. It’s pretty straightforward – you’ll just need to provide a clean mid-stream sample. While we're waiting for those results, I also want to discuss some lifestyle changes that might help alleviate your symptoms. Things like reducing caffeine and alcohol intake, avoiding drinking large amounts of fluids before bedtime, and trying to urinate when you feel the urge, rather than holding it in. Would you be open to trying those things?
PATIENT: Lifestyle changes… yes, I can certainly try that, Doctor. Less caffeine, less drinkin’ before bed… I can manage that. I don’t drink much anyway, to be honest. And tryin’ to go when I gotta go, that makes sense. Anything that might help, I’m willing to try. It’s just… worryin' me some.
DOCTOR: I understand your worry, Dondre. It’s good you're willing to make those changes. In the meantime, we’ll get the results of those tests back in a few days. I’ll give you a call as soon as they’re available to discuss them and determine the next steps. In the unlikely event you develop a fever, chills, or severe pain while urinating, please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me right now before we finish up?
PATIENT: No, ma'am. I think you've covered everything. Thank you for takin' the time to listen to me, Doctor. And thank you for explainin' everything so clearly. I appreciate it. I’ll try those lifestyle changes, and I’ll be waitin’ for your call.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Dondre. I’m glad I could help. And please, don't hesitate to call the office if you have any concerns before I get the results back. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood and get that urine sample. Have a good day, and take care of yourself.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You have a good day too. .
