DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Benic. I am Dr. Paraskevopoulos. It says here you’re 63 years of age. Please, have a seat. Now, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Aye, good morning to you too, Doctor. And please, call me Aurthur. It's... well, it's this morning sickness, I suppose ye'd call it. Not ideal for a man my age, eh? It's been happening for a few weeks now, and it's got me a bit worried, seein' as how my heart's not been the strongest lately.
DOCTOR: "Morning sickness," you say. A rather…unconventional presentation for a gentleman of your years, Aurthur. To clarify, are you experiencing nausea and vomiting, primarily in the mornings?
PATIENT: Aye, that's it exactly. Nausea, and... well, sometimes it comes up, ye ken? Mostly just feels like I'm gonna be sick, though. And aye, it is usually in the mornings, after I've had a bit o' breakfast. Though lately, it's been hangin' around a bit longer, not just right after I eat. Does that make sense? I'm no' good at explainin' these things.
DOCTOR: Hmm. And how long precisely has this been occurring?
PATIENT: Let me think now… It started, oh, about three weeks ago, I'd say. Maybe a wee bit longer. At first, I thought it was just somethin' I ate, ye ken? A bad bit o' fish or somethin'. But it's kept comin' back, regular as clockwork. Three weeks, give or take a few days. I’m fairly certain it’s been long enough to be a proper concern.
DOCTOR: And has anything changed in your diet recently, Aurthur?
PATIENT: Not really, no. I've been keepin' to the same things for a while now. Porridge most mornings, a bit o' soup for lunch, and somethin' simple for supper. I haven't been tryin' any new fancy foods or anything. Though... now ye mention it, I did switch brands o' tea a few weeks back. Just a different shop, nothin' exotic. Could that be it, d'ye think?
DOCTOR: It could be the tea, though it’s rather improbable. Let's move on. Are you experiencing any other symptoms alongside the nausea and vomiting?
PATIENT: Aye, well... I've been a bit more tired than usual, I suppose. Not achin' tired, just... drained. And my ankles have been a bit swollen in the evenings. I just put it down to the heat, mind ye. We've had a proper scorcher of a summer so far. I'm also a wee bit short o' breath when I walk up the hill to the shops. It's not terrible, but it's definitely noticeable.
DOCTOR: Swollen ankles and shortness of breath… and you mentioned fatigue. Are you experiencing any chest pain, palpitations, or dizziness?
PATIENT: No, no chest pain at all. My heart flutters a bit sometimes, but that's been happenin' for a while now, and it's not new. And no dizziness, thankfully. Just... that tiredness. And the ankles. They're not bad, mind ye, but they definitely puff up somethin' fierce by the end o' the day. I usually have to put my feet up for a good hour or so before they go back to normal.
DOCTOR: Aurthur, given your symptoms – the nausea, vomiting, fatigue, ankle swelling, and shortness of breath – and your history of heart palpitations, I’m concerned about the possibility of underlying cardiac or renal issues. We need to investigate this further. I’m going to perform a physical examination, and I will order some blood work and an electrocardiogram, or EKG, to assess your heart function and kidney health. Does that sound agreeable to you?
PATIENT: Aye, that sounds right sensible, Doctor. I'd be grateful for ye to have a proper look. I'm no' one for fuss, but I’d rather know what's goin' on, rather than just sit and worry about it. Blood work and that… heart thing ye said… aye, let’s get it done. Just tell me what I need to do.
DOCTOR: Very well. First, let's take your blood pressure and listen to your heart and lungs. Please lie back on the examination table. I’ll also need to examine your ankles to assess the swelling. And finally, we'll get you set up for the EKG. It's a painless procedure where we attach a few small sensors to your chest to record your heart's electrical activity. Blood pressure is 150 over 90. A bit elevated. Now, let's listen to your heart. Heart sounds are regular, but I detect a slight murmur. Lungs are clear bilaterally, though I do note some mild crackles at the bases. Ankle edema is present bilaterally, 2+ pitting edema. Now, let's move on to the EKG.
PATIENT: Aye, I understand. Just tell me what ye need me to do, Doctor. I’m happy to cooperate. Sensors, ye say? No problem at all. I've had a few tests in the past, so I’m used to it. Just get on with it when ye’re ready. I trust yer judgement. I can feel a wee bit o’ shortness o’ breath just lyin’ here, to be honest. Hope that’s no’ a bad sign.
DOCTOR: No, it’s not necessarily a bad sign, Aurthur. It’s good you’re aware of it. We’ll get a baseline reading and assess it. Alright, we have a reading. It appears you have some evidence of left ventricular hypertrophy, and some non-specific ST-T wave abnormalities. We'll need to review this in more detail, but this combined with your symptoms and the physical exam findings is concerning. I'm ordering a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, a thyroid stimulating hormone test, and a chest X-ray. I also want to order a BNP level to assess for possible heart failure. Given your shortness of breath and these initial findings, I think it's prudent to refer you to a cardiologist for further evaluation. I’m also going to prescribe a low-sodium diet until we have the results. Would you be agreeable to that?
PATIENT: Aye, that sounds right thorough, Doctor. I'm grateful for ye takin' it so seriously. A cardiologist sounds sensible, and I'll happily see one. Low sodium, ye say? I can manage that. I’ve always been fond o’ a bit o’ salt on me porridge, but I can give it up if it’s for the best. I’m no’ gettin’ any younger, am I? Just want to get this sorted out so I can get back to me gardenin'. Is there anythin' else I need to know right now? Perhaps somethin' I should be watchin' out for before I see this heart specialist?
DOCTOR: That’s a very reasonable attitude, Aurthur. And yes, there are a few things to watch for. Should you experience any worsening shortness of breath, chest pain, dizziness, or significant swelling in your legs or abdomen, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do not wait for your appointment with the cardiologist. Also, strictly adhere to the low-sodium diet. I will have the nurse provide you with a handout detailing foods to avoid. I will also have the nurse schedule an appointment with a cardiologist for you, and provide you with the necessary referrals. Finally, I will send these results to your primary care physician, as well. We are taking this seriously, and these tests are to ensure that we can get a definitive diagnosis and appropriate treatment for you. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Aye, that's good to know, Doctor. I'll keep a close eye on those symptoms, and I’ll stick to the diet. I appreciate ye tellin’ me what to look out for. Just one thing... I'm not insured, ye see. Will these tests be… expensive? I’m on a fixed income, and I don’t want to end up in a difficult situation. I know it’s a silly question, but I have to ask.
DOCTOR: That is a valid concern, Aurthur, and not a silly question at all. I understand your situation. Let me see what we can do. Our hospital does have a financial assistance program for patients who are uninsured or underinsured. The nurse will provide you with the necessary information and assist you with the application process. We’ll also explore any potential options for reduced-cost testing. I will also speak with the cardiologist’s office to see if they offer any payment plans or assistance programs. We will do everything we can to ensure you receive the care you need, regardless of your financial situation. Do not let financial concerns prevent you from seeking necessary medical attention. Now, I will have the nurse come in to review the instructions, schedule the appointments, and provide the financial assistance information. Is there anything else I can address for you at this time?
PATIENT: Aye, that's a weight off me mind, Doctor. Thank ye kindly for lookin' into that. I really appreciate it. No, I think that covers everything for now. Just gettin' me head around it all is a bit much, to be honest. I'm ready for the nurse whenever she's ready. Thank ye again for yer time and yer help. I feel a wee bit better knowin' we're gettin' it sorted. .
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Aurthur. It’s my pleasure. Remember, we are here to help you every step of the way. I will have the nurse come in immediately. And please, do not hesitate to contact the office if you have any further questions or concerns. Take care of yourself, and we will see you soon. .
