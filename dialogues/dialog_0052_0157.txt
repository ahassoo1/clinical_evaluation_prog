DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Dudney. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Shely. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Look, I already told the receptionist. High blood pressure. My husband made the appointment. He worries too much. Is that all you need to know?
DOCTOR: I understand your husband scheduled the appointment due to concerns about your blood pressure. While I appreciate the information from the receptionist, it’s helpful for me to gather a more detailed history directly from you to ensure I have a complete understanding of the situation. Even if it is just a routine check, a comprehensive understanding is always best practice. Could you tell me, in your own words, what led your husband to believe your blood pressure might be elevated?
PATIENT: He checks it sometimes. With that machine. The one that goes on your arm. He said it was high a few times. I feel fine, though. Really. He just… he reads things online, you know? Gets all worked up over everything. It's probably nothing. Honestly, I'm wasting my time here. Is there anything fast I can do to get this over with?
DOCTOR: I appreciate you sharing that, Ms. Dudney. It’s understandable to feel frustrated when concerns arise from online research. It’s good that your husband is attentive to your health, but as you said, it's always best to have a professional evaluation. To clarify, when he checks your blood pressure with the machine at home, does he record the numbers?
PATIENT: Yeah, he writes them down in a little notebook. A tiny one. He keeps it on the kitchen counter. Honestly, I don't bother looking at it. Numbers aren't my thing. He'll probably have them all organized when we get home. But right now? I haven't seen them in weeks. Do I need to remember specific numbers? This is ridiculous.
DOCTOR: It's alright if you don't have the numbers readily available, Ms. Dudney. It's more helpful for me to understand the frequency of the elevated readings he's observed. Would you say it happens occasionally, frequently, or almost every time he checks it?
PATIENT: Ugh, I guess… mostly when he checks it after I’ve been doing something. Like, if I've been gardening, or cleaning the house… or even just after we've had visitors. He says I get “flustered” easily. He’s always saying that. So, probably more often then not. Does that make sense? I really don't pay attention to the stupid machine.
DOCTOR: Yes, that does make sense, Ms. Dudney. It sounds like the readings may be higher after periods of activity or stress. That's helpful information. To get a clearer picture of your overall health, could you tell me a little about your medical history?
PATIENT: Medical history? Seriously? I go to the dentist twice a year. I haven't been to a real doctor in… well, a long time. Nothing's ever been wrong. My husband keeps telling me I need to start keeping track of things, but… I just don’t. I don’t have any illnesses or anything. I eat okay, I guess. He worries about my salt intake. He's a bit of a nag, honestly. Is this going to take much longer?
DOCTOR: I understand your reluctance, Ms. Dudney. It's good that you generally feel well. Even without a history of illness, it's still important to gather some background information. It helps me to understand your baseline health and any potential risk factors. Perhaps we can start with your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, diabetes, high blood pressure, or kidney problems?
PATIENT: Ugh, family history… okay. My grandma, on my mom’s side, she had… something with her heart. She was really old when it happened, though. Like, ancient. And my uncle, my mom’s brother, he had diabetes. But he ate a lot of sweets. He didn’t take care of himself. That’s all I really know. My mom just always said, “Eat your vegetables.” She wasn’t a medical person or anything. Look, can we just take my blood pressure and be done with this? I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Dudney. That’s helpful information. It’s good to know about your grandmother’s heart condition and your uncle’s diabetes. Certainly. Let’s proceed with checking your blood pressure. I’m also going to listen to your heart and lungs, and briefly examine you, just to get a more complete picture. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. Just get it over with. Honestly, I’m starting to feel stressed just being here. Which probably isn't helping anything, right? This is ridiculous. Can I at least sit down? This chair is uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Of course, please, have a seat. And you are correct, feeling stressed can temporarily elevate your blood pressure, which is why we try to create a calm environment. Let’s start by taking your blood pressure. I’ll need you to sit quietly with your feet flat on the floor for a few moments. I'll use the cuff on your upper arm, is that alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, fine. Whatever. Just… hurry. This arm feels kinda cold. And don’t squeeze it too tight, okay? I hate feeling restricted. .
DOCTOR: I’ll be as quick and gentle as possible, Ms. Dudney. I understand your discomfort. I am reading 148 over 92. Your pulse is 78 and regular. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs now, if that's okay. Your heart sounds are normal; no murmurs or extra sounds detected. Lung sounds are clear to auscultation bilaterally. . I'm going to palpate your abdomen briefly, if that’s alright.
PATIENT: Ugh, fine. Just don't poke around too much. I hate being touched. This is so undignified.
DOCTOR: Your abdomen is soft, non-tender, and non-distended. No masses or organomegaly detected. Everything feels normal to the touch, Ms. Dudney. Based on the blood pressure reading and my physical examination, your blood pressure is elevated. A single elevated reading doesn't necessarily indicate a problem, but it warrants further investigation. It is possible that it was elevated due to stress related to being in the clinic. Do you regularly monitor your blood pressure at home?
PATIENT: No! I told you, my husband does. He's the one with the machine. He's the one obsessed with numbers. Honestly, I try to ignore it. I don’t need another thing to worry about. Can we just… get a prescription for something? Something to make it go down? I don’t want to be on pills forever, though. Is there something quick I can take?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Dudney. It's perfectly reasonable to want a quick solution, but it's important to approach this carefully. Starting medication without a clear understanding of the underlying cause isn't ideal. Given your elevated reading today and your husband’s reports, I recommend we do some further testing to get a better understanding of your blood pressure. I'd like to order a basic metabolic panel, a lipid panel, and an EKG to assess your kidney function, cholesterol levels, and heart health. Additionally, a 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitor would be very helpful to see how your blood pressure varies throughout the day and night. Would you be agreeable to those tests?
PATIENT: Ugh, more tests? Seriously? This is getting ridiculous. Can’t you just give me something for it? I have a garden to take care of. And a life. Fine, whatever. Do what you need to do, just get it over with. I’m not going to sit here all day. Just… try not to poke me too much. And can I at least get a doctor's note for work? My boss is a pain.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Dudney. I assure you, we'll try to keep everything as quick and comfortable as possible. I'll order the blood tests and the 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitor. The blood tests can be done at the lab next door. The technician will just need a sample of your blood. And we can schedule a time for you to pick up the ambulatory blood pressure monitor and learn how to use it. And yes, I can certainly write a doctor's note for work. What does your boss require on the note specifically?
PATIENT: Just something saying I was here. That I had an appointment. He likes to make things difficult. Honestly, I wouldn’t be surprised if he made me prune roses while wearing a full suit. He’s like that. Just a generic note saying I was seen by a doctor. That should be enough to shut him up. Ugh, can we just be done now? I’m starting to get a headache.
DOCTOR: Here you go. It states you were evaluated by a physician today, August 2, 2025. It does not specify the reason for your visit, as per your request. Alright, Ms. Dudney. Before you leave, I want to emphasize the importance of following up with these tests. Once we have the results, we can discuss the best course of action. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding excessive salt intake, managing stress, and maintaining a healthy lifestyle. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No. I think I’ve had enough questions for one day. Just… let me go. I need to get home. And I need a nap. Thanks, I guess. .
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Dudney. I understand. The nurse will escort you to the lab to get your blood tests done. Please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns. Have a good day, and I look forward to seeing you again for your follow-up. .
