DOCTOR: Alright, good morning. I’m Dr. Gorga. So, Keoni, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s a bit awkward to discuss, honestly. I’ve been needing to use the restroom quite often lately. It’s… disruptive, to say the least. I’m not entirely sure when it started, to be frank. Things have been a bit… hazy recently.
DOCTOR: Okay, “quite often”… can you give me a little more detail?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think… It’s more than usual, certainly. I suppose… every couple of hours, at least, during the day. And… sometimes I wake up in the night to go. It’s not… painful, thankfully. Just… frequent. It’s hard to explain, because I don’t really remember things being different, but I feel like this is new. Does that make any sense?
DOCTOR: Alright, so frequent urination, both day and night… no pain, and you’re unsure when it began. Hazy recollection… Okay. And is it a large amount each time, or just small amounts?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s a good question. I… I think it’s normal amounts. Not tiny, dribbles, certainly. Not huge floods, either. Just… regular. I really wish I could be more precise, but honestly, I don’t pay much attention to those details. I know, it’s terribly unhelpful. I apologize. Is that… important?
DOCTOR: It is helpful to know, Keoni, don't apologize. Regular amounts is good to know. And you mentioned “hazy recollection”... are you experiencing any memory issues generally, or just with this specific symptom?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s a difficult question. I… I wouldn’t say issues exactly. More like… gaps. Little things. I forget where I put my keys sometimes, or the name of that actor in that movie… things like that. Nothing major, I don’t think. It's just… frustrating. I wouldn’t say it’s a new thing, but it seems… more pronounced lately, perhaps. I truly don’t know if it’s related to the… frequent urination, though. It could just be… me.
DOCTOR: Okay. So, some forgetfulness, potentially increasing recently. Let’s move on to other things. Have you noticed any changes in your thirst?
PATIENT: Changes in my thirst… You know, now that you mention it… perhaps a little? I feel like I’ve been drinking more water than usual, yes. But again, it’s summer, and it’s quite warm, so I assumed it was just the heat. I don’t feel excessively thirsty, if that makes sense. Just… more conscious of drinking water, perhaps. I'm really trying to stay hydrated.
DOCTOR: Alright, increased water intake, potentially related to the warmer weather. Any changes in your appetite, or have you noticed any unexplained weight loss or gain recently?
PATIENT: Appetite… no, not really. I've been eating… normally, I believe. Though, I haven’t been weighing myself regularly. Weight loss… no, I don’t think so. Perhaps a pound or two, but nothing significant. I attribute that to the heat as well, honestly. It's rather difficult to maintain a consistent weight when it's so warm. I'm sorry I can't be more precise. Is that helpful at all?
DOCTOR: It's alright, Keoni. We're getting there. Let’s talk about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Medical conditions… Hmm. Well, I was divorced a few years ago, if that counts. No, seriously… I don’t believe so. I haven’t been to the doctor in quite some time, to be honest. I’ve always been… fairly healthy. No major illnesses, no surgeries… I had the usual childhood vaccinations, I suppose. I really don’t have much to report, I’m afraid. It’s rather… bare. Is that a problem?
DOCTOR: Okay. No prior medical diagnoses, haven't been to the doctor recently… Alright. Any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… No, not that I'm aware of. I've never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. No food allergies, no medication allergies… I can take penicillin without issue, I believe. I… honestly, I don't think I'm allergic to anything. It's another blank space, really. Does that sound strange? I feel terribly unhelpful.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. And are you currently taking any medications, prescription or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: No, not at all. I avoid medications whenever possible. I prefer… natural remedies, if I can. But I haven’t really needed anything recently. Just… the occasional pain reliever for a headache, perhaps. But nothing regularly, and nothing prescribed. I try to stay away from them, if I can. I truly don’t take any medication, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Okay. No medications. Now, a few questions about your lifestyle… Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh. Well… no, I do not smoke. I’ve never been a smoker. I… occasionally have a glass of wine with dinner, perhaps. Just one, or sometimes two, on a weekend. Nothing excessive. And absolutely not, I do not use any recreational drugs. Never have, never will. I… I lead a fairly… quiet life. Is that… acceptable? I hope that answers your question.
DOCTOR: Okay. Occasional wine, no smoking, no recreational drugs. Now, let's do a quick physical exam, if you don't mind. I'd like to check your blood pressure, pulse, and listen to your heart and lungs. And I'll need a urine sample, if that's alright.
PATIENT: That sounds… perfectly alright, Doctor. A physical exam is sensible. And yes, of course, I can provide a urine sample. Is there anything specific I should be aware of when collecting it? I want to be sure I do it correctly. I apologize if this sounds foolish, I haven’t been to a doctor in… quite some time, as I’ve mentioned.
DOCTOR: Not at all, Keoni. It’s perfectly normal to be unsure. Just a clean catch midstream is fine. There's a cup in there, and I’ll give you instructions. I’ll be just outside, and you can call me when you’re finished. After that, we'll check your blood pressure and listen to your heart and lungs. It won’t take long.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. Thank you. I’ll call when I’m finished.
