DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Carlotta. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Patricia Shely. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Hmm… what bring me? My wife… she want baby. We… old now. She say maybe need help make baby. I think so too. We want to know… is possible?
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Carlotta. You and your wife are hoping to start a family, and are wondering about the possibility of conception at this stage in your lives. That’s perfectly reasonable to discuss. To give you the best advice, I’ll need to gather some more information. Let’s start with you, if you don’t mind. Could you tell me a little about your overall health?
PATIENT: My health… hmm. I work with metal, plastic. Make small things. Not too hard work now, I take easy. I… I don’t get sick much. Maybe little cough sometimes in winter. I eat… normal food. My wife, she cook good food. I think I am okay. Old, but okay.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear you generally feel well. And it sounds like you have a good diet, which is excellent. "Normal food" is a good start – we can talk about specifics later if you’d like. Do you have any diagnosed medical conditions – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: High… blood pressure? I think… doctor tell me once, long time ago, something about that. Not bad, he say. Just… watch salt. I forget now. Diabetes… no, I don’t think so. Heart… maybe a little beat fast sometimes when I work hard, but not too bad. Old heart, you know? I don’t remember much from doctor visits… long time.
DOCTOR: Thank you for letting me know. It's common to forget details over time. We can certainly look into your blood pressure today. And it’s good that you haven’t been diagnosed with diabetes. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Surgeries… hmm. When I was young boy, I fall from tree. Break arm. They fix arm. That’s all I remember. Hospital… maybe for arm? Long, long time ago. Not since. I try to stay away from hospital. Bad place, hospitals.
DOCTOR: I understand your feelings about hospitals. We'll try to keep things as brief and comfortable as possible today. Just confirming, a broken arm as a child is your only surgery or hospital stay that you recall. Now, could you tell me about your family history?
PATIENT: Family… hmm. My father… he live long life. Good life. He work with land, grow food. Mother… she die young, when I little boy. I don’t know much about her health. I have… brothers and sisters, many. I lose touch with them long time ago. They all… okay, I think. Not much sickness in family, as I know. Just old age, mostly.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Carlotta. It’s helpful to know your family generally had good health and longevity. Knowing there’s no significant family history of illness is good. Now, a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you smoked in the past?
PATIENT: Smoke? No. Never smoke. My wife, she don’t like smoke. I don’t need smoke. Bad for you, smoke. Always thought that.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent. That's a very good habit to have. And do you drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Alcohol… sometimes. Small glass of wine with dinner, maybe. Not every day. Mostly on special day, with wife. I don’t drink much. Not big drinker.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Mr. Carlotta. And finally, are there any medications you currently take, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications… hmm. Just little pills for my knees. They get sore sometimes, old age. I forget what they call. Wife get them for me. And sometimes, I take… something for my stomach. When it upset. That’s all. Small pills. Nothing big.
DOCTOR: Okay, pills for your knees and something for your stomach when it's upset. We can go over those specifically later to make sure everything is appropriate. Now, before we move on to your wife’s health history, let’s do a brief physical exam. I’d like to check your blood pressure, pulse, and listen to your heart and lungs. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Blood pressure… okay. You check. I trust you, Doctor. Pulse… yes, okay. I get a little nervous with doctors, but… I need to know if baby possible, yes? So, check everything you need to check.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly understandable, Mr. Carlotta. I'll do my best to make you comfortable. It will be quick and painless. Alright, your blood pressure is a little elevated – 148 over 88. Your pulse is regular at 76. Your heart and lungs sound clear, but we'll want to monitor that blood pressure. I’d also like to check your reflexes and a quick exam of your knees. Your reflexes are normal, and your knees show some mild tenderness, consistent with your description. Now, let's talk about your wife's health history. Is she with you today?
PATIENT: Yes, she is. She sit outside, little shy. She not like doctors much either. She is ready when you need her. Blood pressure high, you say? Is that bad?
DOCTOR: It’s good she’s here. We can certainly examine her when she’s comfortable. A blood pressure of 148/88 is a bit higher than we'd like, Mr. Carlotta, and it's something we’ll need to address. It doesn't necessarily mean anything is severely wrong, but it's important to investigate. We may need to discuss some lifestyle changes or medication to help lower it. Before we bring your wife in, let’s quickly discuss your concerns about starting a family. How long have you and your wife been trying to conceive?
PATIENT: Trying… not really trying, you know? We… we not think about it much lately. We older now. We have children, grown up. Grandchildren. But… my wife, she want one more. She always want a big family. We… we not worry too much if it happen, or not. But she ask me, and… I come here to see if possible, yes?
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Carlotta. It's admirable that you’re exploring this option with your wife. It’s wonderful she has that desire, and I commend you for coming in to discuss it. Given your age and potential health concerns, achieving a pregnancy may require some assistance. However, it’s important to assess both your and your wife’s health thoroughly before making any decisions. Would you be comfortable if we brought your wife in now?
PATIENT: Yes, please. She wait patiently. She little nervous, but she want to know if baby possible, yes? Tell her you be gentle, she scare of needles.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I will absolutely be as gentle as possible and explain everything beforehand. No needles without a full explanation, I promise. Mrs. Carlotta, would you be comfortable coming in now?
