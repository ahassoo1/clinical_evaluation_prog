DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Geho. I am Dr. Paraskevopoulos. It is a pleasure to meet you. Please, have a seat. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to the clinic today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It's nice to meet you too. Well, I got a letter saying my cholesterol is a little high. That's why I'm here, to figure out what that means and what we can do about it. I don't really know much about it, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Very well. A preventative measure, then, prompted by recent lab results. That’s quite sensible. High cholesterol is… a common issue. Let’s delve into that. First, I want to establish a baseline. Do you have any family history of high cholesterol, heart disease, or stroke?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think. My father… yes, he had some heart trouble later in life. Not a full stroke, but he had some problems with his circulation. My mother, she was pretty healthy all her life, as far as I know. No cholesterol issues on her side. Does that help? I remember her always saying she walked everywhere, even when she got older.
DOCTOR: Circulatory problems in your father are relevant, certainly. And your mother's activity level is… commendable. Now, Ms. Geho, let's discuss your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any other conditions – diabetes, hypertension, perhaps thyroid issues?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. I've always been pretty lucky, health-wise. Just the usual colds and flu, nothing serious. I have Medicare, so I see a doctor regularly for check-ups, but they haven't ever told me about anything else being wrong. I get my bloodwork done every year with the Medicare yearly check-up.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Your records corroborate that you’ve been consistently monitored. And, as you said, those annual panels are helpful. Now, let’s address your lifestyle. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no! Never touched a cigarette in my life. My mother always said they were awful, and I listened to her. I do enjoy a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, maybe three or four times a week. Is that bad? I don't drink hard liquor though, just wine.
DOCTOR: Wine is… permissible in moderation, but three to four times a week is rather frequent. Now, let’s move on to diet. Could you briefly describe your typical daily diet?
PATIENT: Well, I try to eat healthy. I make oatmeal for breakfast most days, sometimes with fruit. Lunch is usually a sandwich, maybe turkey or chicken. And dinner… varies. I cook at home a lot – soups, salads, pasta. I like pasta. I do like red meat sometimes, maybe once a week, like a steak. I try not to eat too much fried food, but I do like french fries occasionally.
DOCTOR: A reasonably balanced diet, then, though the frequency of red meat and occasional fried foods is worth noting. And now, regarding exercise. Do you engage in any regular physical activity?
PATIENT: I walk. A lot. I live in town, so I walk to the grocery store, the library, to see friends. I don't really exercise exercise, if you know what I mean. Not running or anything like that. Maybe a mile or two a day, most days. It's just how I get around. I used to swim when I was younger, but not anymore.
DOCTOR: Walking is certainly beneficial. However, given your cholesterol results, and your family history, it may not be sufficient. Now, Ms. Geho, I’d like to conduct a brief physical examination to assess your overall health. Is that agreeable to you?
PATIENT: Yes, that's fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgement. I haven't had a full physical in a while, so that would be good, I suppose. Just tell me what you need me to do.
DOCTOR: Excellent. First, I will listen to your heart and lungs. Please, remove your shirt and bra, and I will provide a gown for modesty. Then, we’ll check your blood pressure, and briefly palpate your abdomen. It’s quite standard, I assure you. The changing room is just to your right. Take your time.
PATIENT: Okay, sounds good. To the right, you say? Alright. I'll just… go change then. It's a little awkward, but I understand it's necessary. Is there a place to put my clothes?
DOCTOR: Yes, there is a hook right there. And a small shelf, if you prefer. I will be just outside the door when you are ready.
PATIENT: Okay, I'm ready. Just finished getting changed. All set.
DOCTOR: Very good. Thank you, Ms. Geho. Now, if you’ll please lie back on the examination table. Take a deep breath… and exhale. Good. Heart sounds are… regular, but slightly distant. Not immediately concerning, but worth noting. Deep breath in… and out. Lungs are clear bilaterally. Any tenderness here?
PATIENT: No, nothing hurts when you press there. Feels normal, I think. A little chilly maybe, but that's probably just the room. I do get cold easily, always have. Is everything alright so far?
DOCTOR: No acute tenderness, which is good. Your abdomen is soft. I'm now going to check your pulses in both ankles and feet. Both pulses are present, albeit somewhat weak. This could be related to your circulation issues, or simply age. Now, I will briefly check your reflexes. Reflexes are… diminished, but not absent. Okay, that concludes the physical examination.
PATIENT: Alright. Well, that wasn’t too bad. Diminished reflexes… that sounds worrying, doesn’t it? Is that a sign of something serious? I never had problems with my reflexes before, that I know of.
DOCTOR: Let us not jump to conclusions, Ms. Geho. Diminished reflexes can have many causes – age, inactivity, and even just individual variation. It's not necessarily indicative of a serious underlying condition. Now, regarding your cholesterol levels. According to your recent lab results, your total cholesterol is 230 mg/dL, your LDL is 160 mg/dL, your HDL is 40 mg/dL, and your triglycerides are 150 mg/dL. These numbers are… elevated, particularly your LDL. Your HDL is also somewhat low.
PATIENT: Oh dear. Those all sound…bad. LDL and HDL… what do those even do? And 230… is that a big number? I’m not good with numbers, you see. I always relied on my husband to handle all that stuff. It's just… a lot of information at once.
DOCTOR: I understand it can be overwhelming. Let me simplify. LDL cholesterol, the “bad” cholesterol, contributes to the buildup of plaque in your arteries, narrowing them and increasing your risk of heart attack and stroke. The higher the LDL, the greater the risk. HDL, the "good" cholesterol, helps remove LDL from the arteries. So, the higher the HDL, the better. Your LDL is significantly elevated, at 160 mg/dL. Ideally, it should be below 100 mg/dL. Your HDL is a bit low, at 40 mg/dL. We want that to be above 60 mg/dL. Your total cholesterol of 230 is also above the optimal range. Now, given your family history, lifestyle, and these lab results, I recommend we start with lifestyle modifications and, potentially, medication. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: Oh my goodness. That… sounds serious. So, I do need to do something about it? Lifestyle modifications… what does that even mean? And medication… I always try to avoid medication if I can. What kind of medication are we talking about? Are there side effects? I just… I always thought I was pretty healthy. Walking every day, that should be enough, shouldn’t it? I’m just… a little scared, to be honest.
DOCTOR: It's perfectly understandable to be concerned, Ms. Geho. Walking is beneficial, absolutely, but given your cholesterol levels and your family history, it may not be enough on its own. Lifestyle modifications simply mean making some adjustments to your daily habits to lower your cholesterol. This includes dietary changes – reducing your intake of saturated and trans fats, increasing your fiber intake, and eating more fruits and vegetables. And, increasing your physical activity – perhaps incorporating some more vigorous exercise a few times a week. As for medication, the most common type used to lower cholesterol is a statin. These drugs work by blocking an enzyme in your liver that produces cholesterol. Statins are generally well-tolerated, but they can have side effects – muscle pain, digestive issues, and, rarely, liver problems. We would start with a low dose and monitor your liver function regularly. Now, before we start any medication, I recommend we try lifestyle modifications for three months. We'll repeat your cholesterol levels then and see if that's sufficient. If not, we can discuss statins further. What are your thoughts on that approach?
PATIENT: Three months of trying… that sounds manageable. I can definitely try to eat better, and I suppose I can try to walk a little faster, maybe find some hills. But I don’t really know where to start with all this “saturated fat” and “fiber” stuff. Is there… like, a list of foods I should be eating, and foods I should avoid? And what kind of exercise? I don't want to overdo it. I’m not very coordinated, you see.
DOCTOR: Excellent. That is a sensible approach. I can certainly provide you with resources to help with the dietary changes and exercise. I have some handouts that list foods high in saturated and trans fats to avoid, and those rich in fiber that you should incorporate into your diet. We also have a referral program to a registered dietitian who can provide individualized meal planning. As for exercise, we recommend at least 30 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise most days of the week. This could include brisk walking, swimming, cycling, or even gardening. The goal is to get your heart rate up slightly. We can also refer you to a physical therapist who can design an exercise program tailored to your abilities and coordination level. Now, let’s discuss some specific changes you can make this week. Perhaps starting with replacing red meat with fish twice a week, and adding a serving of oatmeal to your breakfast. Does that sound feasible?
PATIENT: Fish and oatmeal… yes, I can definitely do that. My husband always liked salmon, so I used to make that quite a bit. I haven’t had salmon in a while. And I already have oatmeal. I just… I suppose it's the thought of changing everything all at once that’s a bit daunting. I'm an old dog, you see, hard to teach new tricks. But I’ll try. I promise. As long as I don’t have to run a marathon or anything.
DOCTOR: Precisely. No marathon required, Ms. Geho. Small, incremental changes are far more sustainable. We’re not aiming for perfection, simply for progress. Now, let's schedule a follow-up appointment in three months to repeat your cholesterol levels and assess your progress. Does Tuesday, November 4th at 10:00 AM work for you?
PATIENT: November 4th… yes, that should be fine. That gives me plenty of time to work on the fish and the oatmeal. Thank you, Doctor. I feel a little better now, knowing there’s a plan. And knowing I don’t have to run a marathon. I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly.
DOCTOR: You are most welcome, Ms. Geho. Remember, I am here to support you every step of the way. Should you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment, please do not hesitate to contact the clinic. Now, is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you again, Doctor. You’ve been very kind. I’ll try my best with the fish and the oatmeal! Have a good day.
DOCTOR: You as well, Ms. Geho. And remember, small steps, consistent effort. I look forward to seeing you in November. Don’t hesitate to reach out if anything arises.
