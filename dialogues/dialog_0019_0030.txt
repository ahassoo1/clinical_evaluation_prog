DOCTOR: Well hello there, Kerriann. It’s nice to meet you. I’m Dr. Renzi. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hi Dr. Renzi, nice to meet you too. Um, well, it’s a little embarrassing, but I’ve noticed a change in my body odor. It's…different than usual, and I wanted to get it checked out, just to be safe. It started maybe a couple weeks ago, I think?
DOCTOR: Okay, that's perfectly alright. It’s always best to get these things checked out. Changes in body odor can be a sign of something simple, or something that needs a little attention. A couple of weeks… hmm. Can you describe the difference?
PATIENT: Well, it's not just…sweaty, you know? I always sweat a little, especially working outside laying floors, it's hot work. But this is… almost metallic? And a little stronger, even after a shower. It’s hard to explain. It doesn’t smell bad, exactly, just… different. And noticeable. I keep sniffing myself to make sure I'm not imagining it.
DOCTOR: Okay, "metallic" is helpful. And you mentioned you work outside laying floors… that is physically demanding work. So it could be related to that, certainly. But we want to rule other things out. Just to be thorough. Now, has anything else changed around the same time?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Not really, not that I can think of. My diet hasn’t changed, I’m still drinking the same amount of water… I did have a little bit of a cold a month or so ago, but it was mild and didn’t last long. Oh! My ex-husband has been calling a lot lately, which is stressful, but I don’t know if that would cause a smell?
DOCTOR: Stress can definitely contribute to a lot of things, Kerriann, so don’t dismiss that entirely. We'll definitely keep that in mind. A month ago with the mild cold… okay. And just to get a good overall picture, have you noticed any changes in your appetite, weight, or energy levels recently?
PATIENT: No, nothing with my appetite. My weight has been pretty stable, maybe a pound or two up or down, but nothing major. And my energy… well, laying floors is tiring, but I’m used to it. I haven’t been more tired than usual, if that makes sense. I usually sleep pretty well too, about seven or eight hours a night. Oh! I did start taking a new multivitamin a couple of months ago. It’s one my friend recommended.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know – the new multivitamin is potentially relevant. Do you remember the brand name or anything about the ingredients?
PATIENT: Let me see… it’s called “Vitality Boost,” I think. The bottle is at home, but I remember it had a lot of things in it… B vitamins, definitely, and some stuff for your hair and nails. It's a big pill, kinda orange-colored. My friend said it gives her a lot of energy, that’s why I started taking it. It hasn’t really done much for me energy-wise, to be honest. Just thought I’d try it.
DOCTOR: Okay, “Vitality Boost.” We can look up the ingredients online here shortly. Now, just to cover all the bases, have you experienced any fever, night sweats, or unexplained weight loss alongside this change in odor?
PATIENT: No, no fever at all. And definitely no night sweats. I’m a pretty warm person normally, so I sweat a little in my sleep sometimes, but it’s nothing unusual. And like I said, my weight has been stable. Honestly, I'm more annoyed about the smell than anything, but I figured it was best to get it checked out just in case. It’s just… unsettling, you know? To smell something different on yourself.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Kerriann. It's good you're listening to your body and bringing this to my attention. It is unsettling when something changes. Alright, I think we have a pretty good starting point. Now, would you mind if I did a quick physical exam?
PATIENT: No, not at all. That’s fine. Whatever you think is best. Just let me know if anything feels weird.
DOCTOR: Great. I'm just going to listen to your heart and lungs, and take a look in your ears and throat. Then I’ll quickly check your thyroid and feel for any swollen lymph nodes, just to rule out anything obvious. I’ll also check your skin, just a quick overall look. Your heart sounds regular and strong. Lungs are clear. Any shortness of breath or wheezing that you've noticed?
PATIENT: No, no shortness of breath or wheezing. I get a little winded after a long day laying floors, but that’s normal. It’s hard work! But nothing more than usual. It’s good to hear everything sounds okay so far.
DOCTOR: Ears look clear. Throat is a little pink, but no signs of infection or swelling. Now, I'm going to gently palpate your neck to check your thyroid and lymph nodes. Thyroid feels normal in size and consistency. No swollen lymph nodes. Skin looks good, no rashes or unusual lesions. Everything seems normal so far. Given your description and the exam findings, several things are possible. The change in odor could be related to the multivitamin, a change in your body chemistry from the physical work, or something else entirely. It's often difficult to pinpoint without further investigation.
PATIENT: Okay, that makes sense. So what kind of investigation are we talking about? I'm not really a fan of tests if we don’t need them.
DOCTOR: I completely understand your hesitation, Kerriann. Let's start with the least invasive options. I’d like to order a complete blood count and a comprehensive metabolic panel . The CBC will give us information about your overall blood health and rule out any underlying infections or abnormalities. The CMP checks your kidney and liver function, as well as your electrolyte levels, which can sometimes contribute to changes in body odor. Also, since you started a new multivitamin, it would be helpful to see what’s in it. If you can bring the bottle with you next time, that would be great. We can look up the ingredients and see if anything could be contributing. Would that work for you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds…reasonable. Blood tests are probably okay. And I can definitely bring the multivitamin bottle next time. It’s in my kitchen cabinet. How long does it take to get the results back? And do I need to fast before the blood tests?
DOCTOR: Good. I’m glad that sounds alright. No, you don’t need to fast for these particular tests. You can eat and drink as usual before your appointment. The lab usually gets the results back within a few days—typically three to five business days. Once I have the results, I’ll call you to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and come up with a plan. In the meantime, if the odor becomes significantly worse, or if you develop any other symptoms like fever, chills, or weight loss, please don't hesitate to call the office. Is there anything else I can address for you today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you, Dr. Renzi. You’ve put my mind at ease a little bit. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me. It's sometimes hard to explain these things.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Kerriann. It’s my job, and I'm glad I could help. Don't hesitate to reach out if anything changes. The lab order will be sent electronically to the lab closest to you. They will call you to schedule an appointment. Have a good day, and take care of yourself.
