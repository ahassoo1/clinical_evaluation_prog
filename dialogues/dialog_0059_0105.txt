DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kochubey. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Chagaris. It’s good to meet you. To start, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It's good to meet you too. Uh... well, I'm here about getting surgery. Weight loss surgery, I think? My wife helped me set up the appointment. Honestly, I don't remember all the details. It's been... a lot.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Kochubey. Weight loss surgery is a significant step, and it’s perfectly alright if you’re not certain of all the details right now. Your wife setting up the appointment is very helpful. To begin, could you tell me a bit more about why you’re considering weight loss surgery?
PATIENT: Well… it's just… things have gotten harder. You know? Everything is harder. Getting up, walking around… even playing with my kids. It's embarrassing, to be honest. I just want to feel normal again. I used to be… more active. I don’t really remember exactly when things changed, but… yeah. It’s just getting to be too much. I want to be able to do things.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Kochubey. It takes courage to acknowledge those difficulties, and wanting to feel “normal” again – to be able to participate fully in life with your family – that's a very valid and important goal. So, it sounds like the primary reason you're considering surgery is to improve your overall function and quality of life, to be able to do more of the activities you enjoy. Is that accurate?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s… yeah, exactly. Function and… just not feeling so tired all the time. And I guess… I want to be around for my kids for a long time. It’s hard to keep up with them now, and… well, it worries my wife. She’s a good woman. I want to be healthy for her too. Does that make sense? I’m probably not explaining it very well.
DOCTOR: You're explaining it perfectly, Mr. Kochubey. It makes a great deal of sense. Those are all very powerful motivations. It's wonderful that you have such a supportive wife, and wanting to be healthy for your family is a wonderful goal. To get a better understanding of your overall health and determine if surgery is the right option for you, I’d like to ask you a few more questions. We’ll cover your medical history, any current medications, and do a physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds good. Whatever you need. I… I don't really have a regular doctor, so I probably won't remember much to tell you, but I'll try my best. Just… go slow, okay? Sometimes things don't come back to me so easily.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Kochubey. We will take things at your pace. There’s no rush at all. And it's perfectly alright if you don't remember everything – we'll work through it together. Let’s start with your past medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, heart problems, or anything else?
PATIENT: Um… let me think. High blood pressure… I think the doctor at the emergency room mentioned something about that once, a few years ago. But I don’t… I don’t remember taking anything for it. I think it went down on its own. Diabetes… no, I don’t think so. I’ve had… a lot of problems with my back, though. From work. And… I broke my arm when I was a kid. Does that count? Honestly, I don't really go to the doctor unless something is really, really broken. My wife gets upset about that.
DOCTOR: Okay, so potentially a history of high blood pressure, back problems related to work, and a broken arm in childhood. It's good you mention the back problems – that's important. And it's alright about not seeing the doctor regularly; we'll get a good picture of things today. And just to clarify, when you say the emergency room mentioned high blood pressure, do you recall when that was, roughly?
PATIENT: Uh… let me think… It was… maybe five or six years ago? I was helping a friend move some furniture, and I think I strained something. They checked my blood pressure then, and the doctor said it was high. I don't remember if they gave me anything for it or not. It was just… a quick visit. Everything was kind of a blur. I just remember being really sore.
DOCTOR: Okay, roughly five or six years ago, high blood pressure noted at the emergency room during a visit for a strain injury. And no recollection of medication prescribed at that time. Now, have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Um… no, I don't think so. Not that I remember. I mean, maybe when I was really little, like tonsils or something, but I don’t have any memory of it. My wife might know, she remembers everything. I’m terrible with dates and stuff. I just… don’t recall any surgeries. Definitely not as an adult.
DOCTOR: Alright, no recollection of any surgeries. That's good to know. We can always confirm with your wife if needed. Now, I'd like to ask about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, diabetes, obesity, cancer?
PATIENT: Um… that’s a tough one. My dad… he had heart problems, I think. He passed away when I was pretty young. And my mom… she had… I don’t know, something with her stomach, maybe? She’s still alive, but she doesn't talk about it much. And my brother… he's pretty healthy, I think. No major problems. Honestly, we don’t really talk about health stuff. It’s just… not something we do. I wish I knew more, but I really don't. My wife knows more about that too, probably.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of heart problems in your father, and potentially some stomach issues in your mother. It’s alright that you don’t have all the details, we can try to gather more information if needed. Now, let’s talk about your current medications. Are you currently taking any medications – prescription or over-the-counter – vitamins, supplements, anything at all?
