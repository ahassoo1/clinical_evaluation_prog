DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kammer. I’m Dr. Sham. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. Well, it's a bit silly, really. I just... I was hoping you could write me a little card. A “get well” card, or maybe something to cheer me up. My daughter thinks I need... encouragement. She says I'm being a bit down.
DOCTOR: A card… right. I see. While I’m happy to… acknowledge your feelings, Mr. Kammer, my primary role here is to address your medical concerns. Perhaps we could start by talking about what’s been making you feel down?
PATIENT: Medical concerns? Doctor, I feel fine. Perfectly fine. A little low spirits isn’t a medical condition, is it? I work hard, keep things running… boilers don’t fix themselves, you know. It’s just… life. Sometimes life gets to you. A card from a doctor… it would just mean a lot, that’s all.
DOCTOR: I understand. But even feelings of low spirits can have a medical basis, Mr. Kammer. It's important to rule those out. Have you noticed any changes in your sleep, appetite, or energy levels recently?
PATIENT: Changes? Doctor, I’m 56 years old! Things change. Sleep is… sleep. Food is food. I eat when I’m hungry. Energy… well, I get the boilers going, don’t I? Look, I don’t need a diagnosis for feeling a little bit… thoughtful. I just thought a doctor’s card would be nice. You see patients all day, a little scribble on a card wouldn’t take much of your time.
DOCTOR: Let me just pull up your chart quickly… Alright, Mr. Kammer, I see you were last seen here in… 2023 for a blood pressure check. Everything was noted as stable then. But just to be thorough, and because you are here today, let’s do a brief review of systems. It helps me get a complete picture. Have you experienced any chest pain, shortness of breath, or palpitations?
PATIENT: Palpitations? What do you think I am, a hummingbird? No, Doctor. No chest pain, no shortness of breath. I told you, I'm fine. You’re asking me all sorts of things… like I’m about to fall apart. A little down, yes. But healthy as a horse. And frankly, I find all this questioning a bit insulting.
DOCTOR: I apologize if I’m coming across as insensitive, Mr. Kammer. It’s just… sometimes “feeling a little down” can be a symptom of something else. We want to make sure everything is okay. Have you noticed any changes in your weight, or have you been experiencing any unusual fatigue lately, beyond just the normal tiredness from work?
PATIENT: Normal tiredness from work?! You think running those boilers is some kind of picnic? Of course I’m tired. And no, my weight is the same. I haven’t got time to be weighing myself. Doctor, with all due respect, I came here for a card. A simple gesture. Are you going to write one, or are we going to spend the whole morning discussing my weight and palpitations?
DOCTOR: Mr. Kammer, I understand your frustration. However, as a physician, I have a responsibility to assess your overall health, even if you believe the issue is minor. A card isn’t within the scope of my practice, and frankly, writing one while neglecting a potential underlying medical concern would be unethical. I can offer you a referral to a therapist or counselor who might be better equipped to address your feelings. Would you be open to that?
PATIENT: A therapist?! Doctor, are you serious? I need a little encouragement, not a head shrink! This is ridiculous. I’ve been running those boilers for thirty years, I've faced tougher things than feeling a bit low. You’re a doctor, not a… a feel-good specialist. Look, I appreciate your time, but I see this isn’t going anywhere. I think I’ll just… go. .
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Kammer. I wish you all the best. If you do experience any concerning symptoms in the future – chest pain, difficulty breathing, significant changes in sleep or appetite – please don't hesitate to seek medical attention. .
