DOCTOR: Right, Jaxston Lawther. 22 years old. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Uh, hi. Yeah, well, it's… my head. It’s been giving me trouble. Like, really bad headaches. And I get all sweaty when they happen, and my heart races. It's… unsettling, to say the least. I don't really… keep track of when it happens, exactly. Just when it feels bad.
DOCTOR: "Feels bad," is… not particularly helpful, you understand. We need specifics. How long have these headaches been going on?
PATIENT: Right, yeah, sorry. Specifics… Hmm. It’s been… on and off for a while now. Maybe… six months? A bit longer? I honestly can’t pinpoint it. They didn't start all of a sudden, it was gradual. They used to be just normal headaches, you know? Like, tension headaches. But these… these are different. Worse. And the sweating and heart thing is new. I think. Or maybe I just didn't notice before. It's all a bit blurry, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Blurry is… unhelpful. Alright. So, six months, gradually worsening. And now accompanied by sweating and a racing heart. Do these headaches have a specific location?
PATIENT: Um… yeah, usually it’s… all over, kinda. Like, a band around my head. Sometimes it feels like it's behind my eyes, and sometimes it's more on the sides. It’s not like one specific spot that always hurts, if that makes sense? It shifts around a bit. And it's not… stabbing or anything. Just… pressure. A really, really bad pressure.
DOCTOR: "All over"… still not ideal. Is there anything that relieves the pressure?
PATIENT: Hmm… not really, to be honest. I’ve tried taking some over-the-counter pain relievers, like ibuprofen, but they don't really touch it. Lying down sometimes helps a little, I guess? But not always. Dark room doesn’t seem to make much difference either. Honestly, I usually just have to wait it out. It’s… frustrating. I just kinda… power through, I suppose.
DOCTOR: "Power through." Right. And are there any triggers you've noticed?
PATIENT: Triggers… that’s a good question. I haven’t really… paid attention, I guess? Nothing obvious springs to mind. I mean, I work pretty regular hours, same kinda stuff day to day. It doesn’t seem to be related to stress, not that I’ve noticed. It's not like anything particularly stressful happened before they started, or before a bad one hits. Food doesn’t seem to make a difference either. I'm drawing a blank, honestly. Sorry. I wish I could be more helpful.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, "not helpful" is… a recurring theme here. Let’s move on. Do you have any other symptoms alongside these headaches?
PATIENT: Um… sometimes I feel a bit… nauseous, when they’re really bad. Not like I throw up, just kinda queasy. And sometimes I feel dizzy, but that could just be the headache, I suppose. I don’t really get any visual disturbances, or anything like that. No neck stiffness or anything. Just the headache, the sweating, the racing heart, and sometimes a bit of nausea. And the dizziness, maybe. That's about it, I think. It's all a bit… much, honestly.
DOCTOR: Alright. Nausea and dizziness. And you’ve had these headaches for six months, gradually worsening, with no obvious triggers, no fever, no neck stiffness. Let’s talk about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Not that I know of. I… haven’t really been to the doctor much. I had the usual childhood stuff, chickenpox, that sort of thing. Nothing serious. I broke my arm when I was a kid, but it healed fine. Other than that… nothing. I was divorced a couple years ago, if that counts as medical history? Honestly, I'm pretty healthy, usually. Or I was before all this started. . It's just… this headache is really throwing me for a loop.
DOCTOR: Divorce does not constitute medical history, Mr. Lawther. Past surgeries?
PATIENT: Right, sorry. I just… get a bit flustered. No surgeries, definitely not. Never been under the knife. And… I don't really take any regular medication, other than occasionally ibuprofen for the headaches, which doesn't work, as we've established. I’m not insured, so I try to avoid going to the doctor unless it’s really bad, and this… well, this is starting to feel like it's getting there.
DOCTOR: Alright. No significant medical history, no surgeries, occasionally ibuprofen. Now, family history. Any history of headaches, migraines, or neurological problems in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a tough one. I haven’t really… talked to my family much since the divorce. My… ex-wife’s mother had really bad headaches, I think? She complained about them a lot. And my grandfather, on my dad’s side, he… I think he had something with his nerves, maybe? But I don’t really know the details. It was a long time ago, and I wasn't really paying attention. Sorry. I’m not much help with the family history stuff.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, "not much help" appears to be a consistent theme. Let's move on to social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, no, and no. Never really been into any of that. I occasionally have a beer with my mates, but nothing excessive. Just a pint or two at the pub, maybe once a month. I work a pretty physical job, so I don't really need anything to… unwind. I eat fairly well, I think. Or at least I try to. Mostly just normal stuff, you know? Not a big drinker, not a smoker, definitely not on any drugs. . Honestly, I just want to know what’s wrong with my head. This is really worrying me.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Lawther. Let’s proceed with a physical examination. I’ll need to check your vital signs and perform a neurological assessment. Please lie down on the examination table. We'll start with your blood pressure and heart rate.
PATIENT: Okay, yeah, sure. That sounds… good. Just… let me know if anything feels weird, okay? . Blood pressure and heart rate, right. Sounds… straightforward enough.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is 140/90. Pulse is 88, a little elevated. Reflexes are normal, and coordination appears intact. Cranial nerves are all functioning as expected. However, there is some tenderness upon palpation of the temporal arteries. "Temporal tenderness noted." Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Take a deep breath… and exhale. Lungs are clear. Heart sounds are normal, though there is a slight murmur. "Slight systolic murmur auscultated."
PATIENT: A murmur? What does that mean? Is that bad? Is something seriously wrong? This is starting to freak me out a little bit. I mean, I just have headaches, right? It shouldn't be… all this. .
DOCTOR: A murmur isn't necessarily a cause for alarm, Mr. Lawther. Many murmurs are harmless, often referred to as “innocent murmurs.” However, given your elevated blood pressure and the recent onset of these headaches, we need to investigate further. The tenderness of the temporal arteries is also a point of interest. I'm going to order some blood work – a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and an erythrocyte sedimentation rate to rule out inflammation. We’ll also need an electrocardiogram to assess the murmur. "Order CBC, metabolic panel, ESR, and ECG." And I recommend a consultation with a cardiologist. I’d also suggest attempting to keep a detailed headache diary, documenting the frequency, severity, and any associated symptoms. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Okay… a lot of tests. And a cardiologist… that sounds… serious. Blood work, ECG, headache diary… I understand, I think. But what if it is something serious? What if it’s… something really bad? And how much is all this going to cost? I don’t have insurance, remember? . I’m starting to feel really scared, to be honest. .
DOCTOR: Mr. Lawther, you are catastrophizing. We have not yet determined the cause of your headaches. The tests are simply to rule out potential issues. As for the cost… that is a matter for you to discuss with the billing department. I will provide you with the necessary referrals and documentation. It is your responsibility to manage the financial aspects of your care. In the meantime, continue to monitor your symptoms, and if you experience any worsening of your condition – severe headache, fever, vision changes, weakness, or neurological deficits – go to the emergency room immediately. "Here are your referrals. The lab and cardiology office will contact you to schedule appointments. Do you have any further questions?
