DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Benic. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Patricia Shely. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Aye, good mornin' to ye too, Doctor Shely. Pleased to meet ye as well. Well, it's this mornin' sickness, really. Though I haven't been near a woman in decades, ha! No, it's... I've been feelin' awful queasy first thing, for the past wee while now. It's been botherin' me, especially with... well, with the heart, ye ken?
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Mr. Benic. “Mornin’ sickness” as you describe it, accompanied by concerns about your heart… that’s certainly something we should investigate. To clarify, when you say “for the past wee while,” could you estimate how long this queasiness has been occurring?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think... It started, oh, maybe six weeks ago now? Aye, six weeks. It wasn't constant at first, just now and then. But the last two weeks it's been near every mornin'. Wakes me up feelin' right awful. It doesn't last all day, thankfully. Just the first few hours after I get up. And it's not like food poisoning, nothin' comin' up, just... this rollin' feelin' in my gut, ye ken? Makes it hard to get goin'.
DOCTOR: Thank you. So, approximately six weeks of morning queasiness, primarily upon waking, lasting a few hours, and without any vomiting. That’s helpful. Have you noticed anything that makes it worse – certain foods, activity, or perhaps stress?
PATIENT: Aye, good question. Hmm... I don't think food makes it much worse, to be honest. I've tried eatin' different things, light things, heavy things... doesn't seem to matter much. Stress… well, I live alone, and it's a quiet life, so not much stress there, thankfully. Perhaps gettin' out of bed too quickly? I do tend to leap up, ha! Old habits, ye ken. But even if I take it slow, it's usually there waitin' for me. It's just… unsettling. And worryin', given me heart and all.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, especially with your heart condition. It’s good you’ve already considered potential triggers. Now, could you tell me a bit more about this heart condition?
PATIENT: Aye, right ye are. Well, it's heart failure, they told me. Not gettin' worse quickly, the doctor said last time, but it's there. I take a couple of tablets for it every day... Furosemide and Lisinopril, I think they're called? Keeps the fluid down, mostly. I get a wee bit short of breath if I overdo it, but mostly I manage alright. Been diagnosed for… oh, must be five years now, maybe six. Regular check-ups, but this mornin' sickness is somethin' new, and I just wanted to get it checked out, just in case. I wouldn't want it puttin' any extra strain on the heart, ye ken?
DOCTOR: Thank you for that information, Mr. Benic. It’s very helpful to have a clear picture of your medical history. Given the heart failure and the new onset of this queasiness, it is prudent to investigate further. We need to rule out anything that could be exacerbating your heart condition, or causing this symptom independently. Before we proceed, could you please tell me about any allergies you may have to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Aye, right ye are. Allergies… hmm. Not as far as I know, Doctor. Never had a reaction to anythin', thankfully. I can eat shellfish, no bother. No hay fever, no bee stings… Nothin' comes to mind, truly. I’ve a fairly plain diet, mostly. Not much spice, not much fancy stuff. I've been lucky that way, I suppose. I've got a bit of a sensitive stomach, mind ye, always have, but that's not an allergy, is it? Just gets a wee bit upset easily. But nothin' serious, never needed an EpiPen or anythin'.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Mr. Benic. No known allergies is helpful. And a sensitive stomach is noted. Now, I'd like to perform a brief physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and palpate your abdomen. This will give us a better understanding of your current condition. Is that agreeable?
PATIENT: Aye, that sounds sensible, Doctor. Go right ahead. I trust yer judgement. Been to enough doctors over the years, I've learned to let them get on with it. Just try not to poke too hard, ha! Old man's belly, ye ken? A wee bit tender. But feel free, of course. The more ye know, the better. Just let me know if ye need me to do anythin'.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Benic. I will be as gentle as possible. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs with the stethoscope. Please take a deep breath in, and exhale slowly. I'm hearing a slightly S4 sound on your heart, which is not unexpected given the heart failure. Lungs sound clear, but I do hear some mild crackles at the bases, which could be due to fluid retention. Now, I’ll check your blood pressure and pulse. Your blood pressure is a bit elevated, but not critically so. Finally, I’ll gently palpate your abdomen. Please let me know if you feel any pain or discomfort. I notice some mild tenderness in your upper abdomen, but no guarding or masses. Are you experiencing any pain or discomfort currently?
PATIENT: Aye, the upper abdomen, ye say? That's... I sometimes get a wee bit of indigestion, ye ken? Especially if I eat too much. It's not sharp pain, more of a dull ache. Comes and goes, mostly. It's been a bit worse lately, now that I think on it, coincided with this mornin' sickness. Could be just the worry, I suppose. Makes ye tense up, doesn't it? But aye, a dull ache in the upper tummy, comes and goes. Not bothered me enough to bother the doctor before, but maybe it's connected, as ye say. Nothing that stops me from doin' anythin', thankfully.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Benic. That’s helpful information. Given your history of heart failure, the recent onset of morning queasiness, the mild abdominal tenderness, and slightly elevated blood pressure, I would like to order a few blood tests to get a better understanding of what's going on. These tests will include a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel to assess your kidney and liver function, and a thyroid-stimulating hormone level to rule out any thyroid issues. We will also check your B-type natriuretic peptide, or BNP, level, which can help us assess the severity of your heart failure. Would that be agreeable?
PATIENT: Aye, sounds sensible, Doctor. If it'll help find out what's goin' on, go right ahead. Blood tests are never pleasant, but I've had 'em before, so I can manage. Just let me know if there's anythin' special I need to do beforehand… fasting or anythin' like that. And tell me how long it'll take to get the results. I'm not in a rush, but I like to know these things. Yes, go ahead with the tests. Thank ye.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Benic. For these tests, you will need to fast for 8-12 hours beforehand, meaning no food or drink except water. We can schedule those for tomorrow morning. The results usually take 2-3 business days to come back. In the meantime, I would recommend continuing to monitor your symptoms. If you experience any shortness of breath, chest pain, or swelling in your legs or ankles, please contact us immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Aye, 2-3 days, that's fine. Fastin' isn't a problem, I can manage that. Shortness of breath, chest pain, swellin'… right, I'll keep an eye out for those. Thank ye for remindin' me. Hmm... well, I was wonderin'... Could this mornin' sickness be a side effect of the tablets? Furosemide and Lisinopril, ye said? I've been on 'em for years, but maybe they can cause this after a while? It just seems… strange, startin' now, after all this time. Or is that a silly question?
DOCTOR: That is an excellent question, Mr. Benic, and not silly at all. While both Furosemide and Lisinopril can have side effects, nausea and queasiness are not common ones. However, Lisinopril can sometimes cause digestive upset in some individuals. It's less likely with long-term use, as you’ve been on it for several years, but it's still a possibility. It’s also important to consider that medications can interact with each other and with underlying health conditions, so we can't rule it out entirely. To be thorough, we will also review your medication list to ensure there are no other potential causes. The blood tests will also help us assess your overall health and rule out any other underlying issues. Does that answer your question?
PATIENT: Aye, that's… reassuring, I suppose. Good to know it's possible, at least. And good ye're checkin' everything. I trust yer judgement, Doctor. It's just… worryin', ye ken? When things change after years of bein' settled. But yes, that answers it, thank ye. I think… I think that's all my questions for now. Just gettin' the tests done is a relief, honestly. Just want to find out what's goin' on and get back to normal. Thank ye again, Doctor Shely.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Benic. I understand your concern, and I’m glad we’re taking steps to investigate this further. We will get to the bottom of this. I will have the lab order sent to the front desk, and they will schedule your blood tests for tomorrow morning. Please don’t hesitate to contact us if you experience any new or worsening symptoms. I will review the results as soon as they are available and contact you to discuss them. Thank you for coming in today, and please take care.
PATIENT: Aye, thank ye kindly, Doctor. I appreciate yer time and yer care. I will, and I will contact ye if anythin' changes.
