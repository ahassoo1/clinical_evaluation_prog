DOCTOR: Good morning, Chelise. I'm Dr. Roseburroborough. It's lovely to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. Well, I got a letter... from the lab, I think? Saying my cholesterol is a bit high. Hyper... something, they called it. I don't really understand all that stuff, but it sounded like I should come talk to someone.
DOCTOR: Okay, a letter from the lab regarding your cholesterol. Hyperlipidemia is what they likely referred to – it just means you have higher than optimal cholesterol levels. Not to worry, it’s very common, and we can definitely sort it out. Let me pull up your results here… Ah, yes. Your total cholesterol is 245, your LDL is 160, your HDL is 45, and your triglycerides are 180. Do you have any family history of high cholesterol, heart disease, or stroke?
PATIENT: Oh, okay. Those numbers… they don’t really mean anything to me, do they? Just… high? Let’s see… my father, he had some heart trouble when he was older. Not a full-on heart attack, but… he needed some procedures. And his brother, my uncle Jan, he had a stroke maybe ten years ago. Does that count?
DOCTOR: Yes, that absolutely counts, Chelise. Family history is important. Knowing your father and uncle had those issues gives us a clearer picture. Okay, so we have elevated total and LDL cholesterol, which are the main numbers we look at for heart health risk. LDL is often called “bad” cholesterol, and HDL is “good” cholesterol – yours is a little on the lower side of ideal. Have you had your cholesterol checked before?
PATIENT: Hmm... I think so, maybe when I was younger? It was with my old doctor, and he retired a while back. I honestly can’t remember if he ever said anything about it being high then. It was a long time ago. Everything was always fine then, I think. I’m not good with remembering dates and details like that, honestly. It's just gone from my head.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Chelise, don't worry about it. It’s common to not remember specifics from past checkups. Okay, so we’ll treat this as a relatively new finding. And since we don’t have prior results to compare, we’ll focus on getting a good baseline now. Now, let's talk about your lifestyle. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: No, never have. Tried it once in university, didn't like it. Nasty habit, if you ask me. My mother always said so too. She lived to be 92, and she never smoked a day in her life.
DOCTOR: That's wonderful to hear, Chelise. Avoiding smoking is fantastic for your overall health. Excellent. And what about your diet?
PATIENT: Well... I try to eat reasonably well. I like to cook, mostly Dutch food, you know? Lots of vegetables, potatoes... some meat, of course. But I do have a sweet tooth. I love a good stroopwafel with my coffee! And maybe a bit too much cheese sometimes. It's hard to resist good cheese when you're Dutch! Do I need to cut those things out completely?
DOCTOR: No, not completely! We don’t need to make drastic changes overnight. It's more about balance. We'll discuss some small adjustments that can help lower your cholesterol. And how about exercise?
PATIENT: Oh, I walk quite a bit. I live in the city, so I walk to the shops, to the park… I don't really exercise exercise, if you know what I mean. I don't go to a gym or anything like that. Just… regular walking. Maybe 30 minutes most days? Sometimes more, sometimes less, depending on the weather. Not very exciting, I know.
DOCTOR: That’s great, Chelise! Regular walking is excellent. It's a very good starting point. Alright, so no smoking, reasonably healthy diet, and regular walking. Let's move on to medications. Are you currently taking any medications for anything?
PATIENT: Let me think… Just a little something for my blood pressure. It's not very high, the doctor said, but just enough to take a small pill every morning. And sometimes I take something for my allergies, during the spring. That's about it. Nothing else.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a medication for blood pressure and something as needed for allergies. Do you remember the names of those medications?
PATIENT: Hmm… the blood pressure one… I think it starts with an ‘A’? Amlodipine, maybe? And the allergy one… Oh dear, I really can’t remember. It's a little white pill. I get the prescription filled at the pharmacy down the street, and they know me by now. They probably know what I take better than I do! I'm terrible with names.
DOCTOR: Amlodipine, yes, that's correct. And you’re also using Loratadine for allergies, according to your records. No worries at all about not remembering specifics – that’s what we're here for. Alright, Chelise, based on what you've told me, we have a family history of heart disease, slightly elevated cholesterol, a reasonably healthy lifestyle, and you're taking medications for blood pressure and allergies. Now, I’m going to do a quick physical exam. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your pulse, and feel your abdomen. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Go right ahead. I don't mind at all. Just let me know if anything feels… unusual.
DOCTOR: Okay, take a deep breath for me… and another one… Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear. Pulse is 72 and regular. Blood pressure is 130/80 – good. Abdomen is soft, no tenderness. Everything sounds and feels normal so far. Your heart and lungs are healthy, your blood pressure is well-controlled, and your abdomen is fine. Based on everything we’ve discussed and this exam, my initial thought is that your elevated cholesterol is likely a combination of genetics and diet. We want to try lifestyle modifications first, and then consider medication if needed. I’d like to order a repeat cholesterol panel in three months to see how things are progressing. What are your thoughts on that plan?
PATIENT: That sounds… sensible. Lifestyle changes first is good. I’m happy to try that. Three months sounds reasonable too. I just don’t want to have to take a lot of pills, if I can help it. I’m already taking one for my blood pressure, and that’s enough, really. Do you have any… suggestions for those lifestyle changes? Something I can actually do? I'm not a very good cook when it comes to strict diets, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Chelise. I understand completely. We’re not talking about a strict diet. Small, manageable changes are much more effective in the long run. Here are a few suggestions: Diet: Focus on increasing your fiber intake – oats, fruits, vegetables, beans. Try to limit saturated and trans fats – found in red meat, processed foods, and some dairy products. You don't have to eliminate them entirely, just reduce them. And, as hard as it might be, try to reduce your portion sizes of things high in sugar. Exercise: Continue with your walking – that’s excellent. Aim for at least 30 minutes most days of the week. Maybe you could add a little bit of incline or walk a little bit faster sometimes. Weight Management: Even a small weight loss can help lower your cholesterol. I can also give you a handout with some more detailed information and recipes. And I have a referral for a registered dietician if you’d like someone to work with you one-on-one. They can help you create a personalized meal plan that fits your lifestyle and preferences. What do you think about those options?
PATIENT: That sounds… very helpful. The handout would be great, thank you. And maybe the dietician… I don’t know, I’ll have to think about it. I don't like the idea of a strict plan, but maybe someone to give me a few ideas wouldn't be so bad. I like the idea of just making small changes, like you said. Easier to stick to that way. Do you think it's okay if I try the small changes for a few weeks and then see how I feel before I bother with the dietician? I don’t want to jump into things too quickly.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Chelise. That's a perfect plan. Start with the small changes, see how you feel, and then we can revisit the dietician referral if you feel like you need more support. I'll write you a prescription for the repeat cholesterol panel, and I'll print out that handout now. I'm also going to send a message to the lab to ensure they have all your information. Do you have any questions for me before we finish up?
PATIENT: No, I think you've covered everything very thoroughly. You’ve been very helpful, Doctor. Thank you for not making me feel like I have to completely overhaul my life! I'll try my best to follow your suggestions. And I’ll see you in three months?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Chelise. I'm glad I could help. And yes, let's plan to see you again in three months to review your results. Remember, small steps are key. And if you have any questions or concerns before then, don't hesitate to call the office. Have a lovely day, Chelise.
PATIENT: .
