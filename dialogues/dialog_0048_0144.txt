DOCTOR: Right. Lilly Calvery. 64 years old. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello dear. Well, honestly? Just…curiosity, I suppose. It’s been a while since I’ve been to a doctor. My husband, God rest his soul, always took care of all that. And now…well, now I thought I’d see what all the fuss is about. Is this a newfangled clinic? Seems awfully…bright.
DOCTOR: Brightness is…a modern convenience. And it's good you’re taking initiative. “Curiosity” isn't usually a chief complaint, but we can certainly do a check-up. Though, frankly, at 64, a general assessment is…advisable regardless. Have you been experiencing any specific symptoms lately?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Oh, goodness. Let me think… Well, my knees creak when I get up, naturally. That’s just getting old, isn't it? And I get a little…forgetful sometimes. Though, that’s probably just me. Honestly, I don't feel sick. I eat my vegetables, mostly. And I don’t go running marathons or anything. Is there a questionnaire or something? I’m terrible at remembering details when someone just asks me.
DOCTOR: Knees and forgetfulness…right. Those can be age-related, but we still need to document things properly. A questionnaire would be…tedious for both of us, frankly. Let’s try this. Forgetfulness – is it new?
PATIENT: New? Oh, dear… that’s a good question. It feels like it's been…gradual, I suppose. Not like I suddenly woke up not knowing my own name. More like…misplacing things more often. And sometimes…names escape me. You know, people I should remember. It’s embarrassing, really. I used to have a wonderful memory. I could recite poetry for hours. Now…well, now it's mostly just grocery lists. And even those I have to write down.
DOCTOR: Gradual onset…grocery lists. Alright. And are these memory lapses impacting your daily life at all?
PATIENT: Impacting? Hmm. Well, I wouldn’t say majorly. I just…double-check things more. Like, I set alarms for appointments. And I ask my neighbor, Mrs. Gable, to remind me of things. She’s a dear. It’s mostly just…inconvenient. Not frightening. Though, my daughter, bless her heart, keeps telling me I should get it checked. She worries too much, that one. Is this what doctors do? Just ask a lot of questions?
DOCTOR: It involves asking questions, yes. We need to establish a baseline, understand your history. Your daughter is…sensible. Let’s move on. Any changes in appetite?
PATIENT: Appetite? No, not really. I still enjoy my food. Though, things don’t taste quite the same anymore, if you know what I mean. Not bad, just…less vibrant. Like looking at a faded photograph. I used to love Korean food, spicy kimchi, everything. But now… it's just not the same. My daughter makes a lovely bulgogi, but even that… isn’t as exciting. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Diminished taste… alright. And weight?
PATIENT: Oh, weight. Well, I wouldn’t say I’ve been trying to lose any. Honestly, I probably weigh about the same as I always have. Maybe a pound or two, here or there. I used to be quite slender, you know. Worked in a hospital for years, always on my feet. But these days…well, let's just say comfortable is more important than fashionable. About… 103, I think. Last time I checked, anyway. It's been a while.
DOCTOR: 103 pounds…that is…unusual for your height. 174 centimeters. Alright. Any trouble with breathing?
PATIENT: Breathing? No, not really. I get a little winded when I climb stairs, but that's just old age, isn't it? And sometimes, I have a little cough, especially in the winter. But nothing serious. I don't wheeze or anything. My husband, God rest his soul, had terrible asthma. He had trouble breathing. Me? Just a little puffing. Does that make sense? Is something wrong? You're looking at me funny.
DOCTOR: No, I am simply… documenting. Breathing… alright. Let's talk about medications. Are you currently taking any prescriptions or over-the-counter medications?
PATIENT: Oh, medications. Well, let me think… I take a little something for my arthritis, a small white pill. And sometimes, if I can't sleep, I take one of those over-the-counter sleep aids. The kind with…melatonin, I think it's called. And sometimes, a little something for my indigestion. Honestly, I can't remember the names. My daughter handles most of that. She fills those little pill boxes for me, you know. It's all very organized. She keeps a list, somewhere…
DOCTOR: Alright. And allergies?
PATIENT: Allergies? Oh dear. That's a good question. I don't think so. I've never really paid much attention, honestly. I get a little sniffly in the spring, maybe, but that's just the pollen, isn't it? Nothing serious enough to bother a doctor about. My husband, God rest his soul, was allergic to cats. He had to be very careful. Me? I can tolerate just about anything. Though, I do prefer the smell of roses. Is that an allergy?
DOCTOR: No, roses are not an allergy. Alright. Past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any significant medical conditions?
PATIENT: Oh goodness, that's a long list, probably. I had my tonsils out when I was a girl. And I broke my arm once, climbing a tree. And… let me think. Oh! I had a gallbladder removed, years ago. And…my husband, God rest his soul, always said I had a weak stomach. Is that a condition? Honestly, I've had so many little things over the years, it's hard to keep track. My daughter keeps all my records, somewhere. She's very organized, that one. Is this important? You're writing a lot.
DOCTOR: It’s all relevant. Tonsils, broken arm, gallbladder… Alright. Any surgeries besides the gallbladder removal?
PATIENT: Hmm…let me think… I had a hysterectomy, years ago. That was… a long time ago. And… oh! I had a bunion removed on my foot, once. Very painful, that was. And… honestly, I can’t really remember anything else. My daughter always said I was very healthy, for my age. She's very good at keeping track of things. She worries about me, you know. Is this a lot of information? You’re looking at me funny again.
DOCTOR: Alright. Family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Oh, family history…Well, my mother, God rest her soul, had… something with her heart, I think. She passed away when I was young. And my father, he had… high blood pressure, maybe? He was a very quiet man, didn’t talk much about his health. And… my husband, God rest his soul, had diabetes. Very bad diabetes, towards the end. Honestly, my family wasn’t very good at taking care of themselves. They always said I was the healthy one. Is that important? You're writing a lot. Are you sure you need all this information?
DOCTOR: It’s all relevant. Social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh goodness, no! Never! My husband, God rest his soul, used to have a little glass of wine with dinner sometimes, but I never touched a drop. And definitely not… those things. I was raised better than that. I used to go to church every Sunday, you know. A very respectable woman, that's me. Honestly, the very thought! Is something wrong? You're asking very personal questions.
DOCTOR: No. Just gathering information. Alright. Let’s do a quick physical exam, if you don't mind. Just to get a baseline. Can you stand up for me?
PATIENT: Oh… alright. If you insist. It’s been a while since I’ve been poked and prodded, you know. Oh dear, that’s a little wobbly. My knees aren’t what they used to be. Be careful now, alright? I don’t want to fall. What are you looking for?
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is a little elevated: 148/92. Pulse is regular, 78. Lung sounds are clear, but slightly diminished. Knees show some crepitus upon range of motion. Any pain when I press here?
PATIENT: Oh… a little. Just a dull ache, really. I get indigestion sometimes, you know. It comes and goes. Mostly after I eat something… spicy. Or rich. Or… honestly, sometimes it just happens. My daughter always says I should watch what I eat. She's very good at that sort of thing. Is that bad? Is something wrong?
DOCTOR: Reflexes are a little sluggish. Alright. We'll need to run some blood work to get a clearer picture. Complete blood count, metabolic panel, thyroid function tests… and a Vitamin D level. Also, given your memory concerns, I’d like to order a basic cognitive assessment. We'll rule out any deficiencies or underlying issues. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Oh… that sounds like a lot. Blood work? A cognitive… what did you call it? Honestly, all this poking and prodding and testing… Is it really necessary? I just came in for a little chat, you know? My daughter will be very worried if I come home with a list of tests. She always worries too much. Can’t we just… skip the tests?
DOCTOR: Mrs. Calvery, given your age and the symptoms you've described, it’s prudent to rule out any potential issues. It’s better to be thorough. The blood work is standard. The cognitive assessment is a simple questionnaire, it won’t take long. It's about establishing a baseline. I understand your concerns, but I assure you, it’s in your best interest. We need to have a complete picture to provide you with the best possible care. I will explain everything to your daughter if you like. But we will proceed with the tests. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Oh… alright. If you insist. But my daughter is going to be so worried. She'll want to come with me to every appointment. She always does. And honestly, I don’t like being poked and prodded. It makes me feel… vulnerable. But… alright. If it’s important. What do I need to do? Where do I go? And how long will it take? And… will it hurt?
DOCTOR: It won't hurt, Mrs. Calvery. Just a small blood draw, a quick cognitive assessment. The lab is just down the hall, room 203. They'll take care of you. The cognitive assessment will be done here, with my assistant, Nurse Patel. It will take about 15-20 minutes. Nurse Patel will schedule everything for you. And yes, your daughter is welcome to accompany you, but she doesn’t need to be present for everything. Here's the slip for the lab. And I will have Nurse Patel come in and explain everything to you in more detail. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: Oh… alright. Thank you, dear. That’s very kind of you. But… Nurse Patel? I hope she’s nice. I don't do well with… brusque people. And… is this going to cost a lot of money? My Medicare… it doesn't cover everything, you know. My daughter handles the bills. She's very good at that sort of thing. But I worry about… expenses. And… can I have a cup of tea afterwards? This has been… a little stressful.
DOCTOR: Nurse Patel is perfectly pleasant, Mrs. Calvery. I assure you. As for costs, Medicare should cover the majority of the tests. There may be a small co-pay, but we have a billing department that can assist you with any questions. And yes, there’s a water cooler in the waiting room. You’re welcome to have a cup of tea after the tests. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have other patients waiting. Nurse Patel will be in shortly to get you started. Please don't hesitate to ask if you have any questions. .
