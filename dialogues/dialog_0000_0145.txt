DOCTOR: Well, Mr. Bahta, it’s good to meet you. I’m Dr. Batara. Now, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good day, Doctor. It is a pleasure to meet you as well. I am here because… well, my daughter, she suggested I come. She says something about needing to be sure I can get help at home, if needed. Something about… hospice? I am not entirely certain what that entails, but she seemed quite worried.
DOCTOR: Hospice, hmm. Your daughter is… attentive, it seems. It’s good she's looking out for you. Let’s clarify. You’re here because your daughter is concerned about your ability to manage at home, and she mentioned hospice. Are you experiencing any difficulties at home?
PATIENT: Difficulties… not exactly. I manage. I cook, I clean, I keep up with things. It takes… longer, perhaps. And my back… my back is not what it once was. But I am not helpless, Doctor. Truly. I just… I am a bit older now, that is all. I do not need help, but my daughter… she worries about everything. She is very… thorough.
DOCTOR: Thorough is… a quality. So, you're saying you're generally independent with activities of daily living – cooking, cleaning – but you’ve noticed some slowing down, and you have some back pain. Is this back pain new, or has it been ongoing?
PATIENT: It has been… ongoing for some time now, Doctor. Perhaps five years? It flares up, then calms down. Recently, it has been… more frequent, I suppose. And a bit more… insistent. It does not stop me from doing things, but it reminds me I am not a young man anymore. I take some… pills for it, from my previous doctor. Though, I cannot recall the name at this very moment. It begins with a 'D', I believe.
DOCTOR: A 'D'… Right. Let's pull up your records from your previous physician. Ah, here we are. Dr. Evans. And you were prescribed… diclofenac for your back pain. Is that correct?
PATIENT: Yes! Diclofenac, that is it! You have a very good memory, Doctor. Or, a very good system, perhaps. It helps some days, and other days… not so much. I do not wish to complain. It is just… a small discomfort. I am more concerned about what my daughter is worrying about. She mentioned… tests? Is she expecting you to run tests on me? I do not particularly enjoy hospitals. Or, tests of any kind, truthfully.
DOCTOR: Your daughter is… proactive, shall we say. Tests can be… unsettling, I agree. However, it’s often best to have a clear picture of what’s going on. She likely wants to rule out anything serious. Now, aside from the back pain and your daughter’s concerns, have you experienced any other symptoms recently?
PATIENT: Symptoms… let me think. I have been… more tired, perhaps. Not constantly, but some days I find myself needing a nap. And my appetite… it has not been quite as strong. I eat, of course, but not with the same enthusiasm as before. And sometimes… sometimes I feel a little… confused. Not a great deal, just… a small forgetfulness. Small things, like where I placed my glasses, or what day it is. But nothing alarming, I assure you. It is likely just age, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Fatigue, decreased appetite, and some… occasional confusion. These are all things we should investigate. Now, have you noticed any changes in your weight recently?
PATIENT: Weight… I have not been weighing myself regularly, Doctor. My daughter has a scale, but I haven't used it. I feel a bit thinner, perhaps. My clothes are… a little looser, if that is any indication. But I have not taken any specific measurements. I am not a man who concerns himself with such details. It is more important to me that I can still enjoy my garden, and spend time with my grandchildren.
DOCTOR: Alright. We're going to do a quick physical exam. I'd like to get your current weight and check your blood pressure. It's standard procedure. And then we'll do a brief neurological assessment – just to check your reflexes and cognitive function. It shouldn’t take long. Afterwards, we’ll decide if any further tests are necessary.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. If it is standard, I suppose it is necessary. I do not enjoy the thought of being poked and prodded, but I will cooperate. Please, do not take too long. My appointment with Monsieur Dubois, the baker, is at three o’clock. He is making a special cake for my granddaughter’s birthday. It is a very important cake.
DOCTOR: If you’ll step onto the scale, please. And then we can begin. Don’t worry, I'll be as quick as possible. We'll get through this efficiently, and you won't miss your cake appointment. 116 pounds. Okay. Now, if you could just stand still for a moment while I take your blood pressure. 130 over 80. Not bad, but we will want to monitor it.
PATIENT: Very well. I am standing quite still, Doctor. Though, I must admit, I do not understand why you are writing all of these numbers down. Is it… serious? I do not mean to be difficult, but my daughter always said I should ask questions. She says I am too trusting. Is my weight… low? I have not been eating as much lately, as I mentioned.
DOCTOR: It’s not necessarily serious, Mr. Bahta. It's… data. We collect information to get a complete picture of your health. And yes, your weight is a bit low, which is why I'm noting it. It’s something we need to investigate, but it doesn't necessarily mean anything alarming. Now, let's move on to a quick neurological assessment. I'm just going to ask you a few simple questions, and then I'll check your reflexes. Can you tell me today’s date?
PATIENT: Today’s date… hmm. Let me think… it is… August. August the… second, is it not? Yes, August the second, 2025. Though, I must confess, keeping track of the days has become… more challenging lately. It seems they all blend together. My wife always kept track of the dates. She had a very good memory.
DOCTOR: August the second, 2025. Correct. Good. Now, can you repeat these three words for me?
PATIENT: Three words? Very well. Please, proceed, Doctor. I will do my best.
DOCTOR: Apple… table… penny. Repeat those for me, please.
PATIENT: Apple… table… penny. Yes. Those words… Apple, table, penny. I believe I have them. Is there a trick to this, Doctor? I am not accustomed to repeating words.
DOCTOR: No trick, Mr. Bahta. Just a simple memory test. Now, can you tell me what year we are currently in?
PATIENT: The year… hmm. That is a simple question, is it not? It is… 2025, of course. I believe I mentioned that earlier. Is something wrong, Doctor? You seem… concerned. My daughter said I should be wary of doctors who ask too many questions.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Bahta. Thank you. That will be sufficient for now. Given your reported fatigue, decreased appetite, some weight loss, and occasional confusion, along with your daughter’s concerns, I'd like to order some blood work and a urine analysis. And I also recommend a cognitive screening test—a more detailed assessment of your memory and thinking skills. We need to rule out any underlying medical conditions that could be causing these symptoms.
PATIENT: Blood work… and a urine analysis? A cognitive… screening test? That sounds… rather extensive, Doctor. Is it absolutely necessary? I assure you, I am perfectly fine. A little tired, perhaps, and I forget things from time to time, but that is simply a sign of age. I do not wish to undergo a great deal of testing. I have a cake to attend to, you know. For my granddaughter. A very important cake.
DOCTOR: Mr. Bahta, I understand your reluctance. However, it's my responsibility to ensure you receive the best possible care, and that includes investigating any potential health concerns. These tests are standard procedure, and they will help us determine the cause of your symptoms. It's not about whether you're "perfectly fine" – it’s about being proactive and identifying any underlying issues early on. I’ll order the blood work and urine analysis now. As for the cognitive screening test, we can schedule it for next week. It will take about an hour. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: An hour… an hour is a long time. Very well, Doctor. If you insist. But I must warn you, I do not enjoy being poked and prodded. And I do not wish to miss my appointment with Monsieur Dubois. The cake… it is a very special cake. Very well. Schedule the test. But please, make it as brief as possible. And please, do not keep me waiting. My time is… valuable.
DOCTOR: Alright. I've scheduled the cognitive screening test for next Tuesday at 10:00 AM. Here are the requisitions for the blood work and urine analysis. You can have those done at any lab. And this is the referral form for the cognitive screening. I will also have my nurse call you to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results. Now, is there anything else I can address today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I believe that is all. Although… could you perhaps write down the name of that bakery? Monsieur Dubois… in case I misplace the information. It is a very good bakery. And the cake… it is a very important cake.
DOCTOR: Here you go. Dubois Patisserie, 555-1234. Alright then. I'll see you next Tuesday. If you experience any new or worsening symptoms before then, please don't hesitate to call the office. Have a good day. And I hope your granddaughter enjoys her cake. .
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You have been… thorough. I hope your day is pleasant as well. And thank you again for the bakery information. .
