DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Sciarotta. My name is Dr. Cumper. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. I need to get a card so I can drive for, well, a ride-share service. Something about needing a special license now, and a medical check-up. I believe it’s a commercial driver’s card. I want to get this done quickly if we can, please.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. The requirements for a commercial driver's license, specifically for ride-share services, do involve a medical examination. We can definitely work quickly to get this done for you. First, let’s go over some basic information to start the exam. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions – things like heart problems, diabetes, or anything that might affect your ability to drive safely?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… I had a bad bout of the flu a few years back, but nothing serious, just a really bad fever. And… hmm. My divorce was quite stressful, if that counts as something! But medically? No, nothing major that I can recall. I did have my gallbladder removed when I was in my fifties, but that was a long time ago and I recovered fully. I’ve been pretty healthy, all things considered. Is that enough information, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful. The flu and the gallbladder removal are good to know. Stress can definitely affect your health, but we're focusing on medical conditions here. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a daily vitamin. Nothing else. Doctor, I really try to avoid taking pills if I can help it. My mother always said they just mask the problem, not fix it. It’s a silly old woman’s tale, I suppose, but it stuck with me. Is that alright? Or do I need to be on something for this card?
DOCTOR: No, that’s perfectly alright, Ms. Sciarotta. A daily vitamin doesn't usually interfere with these exams. We just need to be thorough. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies, thankfully! I can eat anything, and I’ve never had a bad reaction to any medicine. My mother always said I had a cast-iron stomach. She was a practical woman, my mother. Is there a list of things I should have remembered to bring? I’m getting worried I’ve forgotten something important.
DOCTOR: No, you haven’t forgotten anything so far, Ms. Sciarotta. You’ve been very helpful. Just a few more questions, then we’ll do a brief physical exam. Have you had any recent changes in your vision or hearing?
PATIENT: Hmm… my eyesight isn’t what it used to be, naturally. I wear reading glasses, as you can probably see. I had my eyes checked last year, and the doctor said it was just normal aging. My hearing is… okay. My daughter always tells me I don’t listen to her, but I think that’s a different problem entirely! No serious changes, though. Just the usual getting older stuff.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to know. And just to confirm, have you ever had any issues with dizziness, fainting, or seizures?
PATIENT: No, never. I’ve always been very steady on my feet, even after a few sips of sake! Though, I did stumble once on a cobblestone street in Kyoto, but that was definitely the street’s fault, not mine. No medical problems with dizziness or anything like that, no. I pride myself on being quite resilient, you see.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Sciarotta, that’s very reassuring. Now, if you don't mind, I'd like to do a quick physical exam. Just a basic check of your blood pressure, pulse, and a listen to your heart and lungs. We'll also check your reflexes and a brief neurological assessment. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly alright, Doctor. Let’s get it over with quickly, if you don’t mind. I have a mahjong game scheduled for this afternoon, and I wouldn't want to be late. I’m rather good at it, you see. Just get it done, and I’ll be on my way.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Sciarotta. We'll be as efficient as possible. If you could just have a seat here on the table, we'll start with your blood pressure. Could you please extend your arm, and relax your shoulder?
PATIENT: Alright. Here you go. Try not to poke me too much with those things! I have very sensitive skin, you know. And please be quick, Doctor. My mahjong partners are very competitive.
DOCTOR: Alright, just relaxing your arm, that’s good. 130 over 80. Not bad at all. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Just breathe normally. Heart sounds are regular, normal S1 and S2. Lungs are clear bilaterally. Good. Now, let’s check your reflexes quickly. Could you please bend your knees and let your legs dangle?
PATIENT: Alright, alright. Dangling legs… I haven’t dangled my legs like this in years! It feels very strange. Just hurry, Doctor, please. I’m starting to feel like a little girl again. Get it over with quickly, and I'll be eternally grateful.
DOCTOR: Okay, reflexes are 2+ bilaterally, which is normal. And just a quick check of your range of motion… Could you please try to touch your toes?
PATIENT: Oh, my. This is getting embarrassing. My back isn't what it used to be. It cracks like an old house! There. Happy? Can we finish this now? I’m pretty sure I pulled something. My mahjong partners will never believe this.
DOCTOR: Yes, alright, that’s sufficient. No obvious neurological deficits. Everything seems to be within normal limits. Based on this brief examination, you appear to be medically fit to drive commercially. I'll need you to fill out a few forms, and then I can submit the necessary paperwork. I’ll also provide you with a medical card. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Oh, thank goodness. No, Doctor, I think I’m alright. Just… how long will this card be good for? And will it actually let me drive for these ride-share companies? I don't want to go through all this trouble for nothing. And please, can you make sure it's easy to read? My eyesight isn’t getting any better, you know.
DOCTOR: The card is valid for one year. As for allowing you to drive, it meets the medical requirements for commercial driving, but the ride-share companies themselves have their own additional requirements regarding driving history and background checks. You’ll need to check with them directly to ensure you meet all their criteria. And yes, I've made sure the card is in a large, easy-to-read font. Here are the forms - just fill out your name, address, and sign at the bottom. Do you need any assistance with that?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s very kind of you, Doctor, thank you. Yes, this is much better. I can manage the forms, I think. My hands are a little shaky, but… So, I just need to show this to the ride-share company, and then I can start driving? It sounds… remarkably simple. Name… address… date of birth… oh, dear, I hope I remember the correct year.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s correct. You’ll submit this form, along with any other documentation the ride-share company requires. If you have any trouble with their application process, you can always contact their customer support. Is there anything else I can assist you with today, Ms. Sciarotta?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think that’s everything. Thank you for being so patient with an old woman like me. And for making the card so easy to read. It’s a small thing, but it makes a big difference. I believe I’ll be going now. I have a mahjong game to win.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Sciarotta. It was my pleasure. And good luck with your mahjong game! Have a good day.
