DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Firestone. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Octavis AX. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s… fine. Honestly, I don’t usually bother with doctors unless absolutely necessary. But my legs… they just gave out a few days ago. After a really nasty cold, you see. Not a pleasant experience at all, and now this. It’s quite inconvenient.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds unsettling to have your legs give out, especially after being sick. “Inconvenient” doesn’t quite cover it, I imagine. To get a better understanding of what happened, can you tell me a bit more about when this started exactly?
PATIENT: Oh, don’t patronize me, Doctor. Of course it's not just inconvenient. It's a disruption, alright? A complete disruption! As for when... let me think. It was… Tuesday, I believe. Yes, Tuesday morning. I was getting ready for a tour – I’m a guide, you know – and I just… couldn’t stand properly. Felt like jelly, everything did. It wasn't gradual, it just was. And frankly, I don't appreciate having to spell it out.
DOCTOR: I apologize if I came across as dismissive, Ms. Firestone. That was not my intention. I appreciate you clarifying when this began. Tuesday morning, just suddenly unable to stand. You mentioned a cold beforehand. Can you describe the cold?
PATIENT: Oh, well, it was a cold. You know, the usual. Stuffy nose, sore throat, cough… Nothing special. I get them occasionally, especially with all these tourists tracking germs in. It lasted about five days, I think. Standard dosage of over-the-counter remedies, I didn’t bother with a doctor for that either. Perfectly capable of handling a little sniffle, thank you very much. It was gone by Monday night, and then – bam – legs decide to stop working. It just doesn't make sense.
DOCTOR: Right, a typical cold, resolving by Monday night, then the leg weakness started. You self-treated with over-the-counter medications. Do you recall what specific medications you used?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, are you making a list of everything I’ve ever consumed? It was… something for the congestion. A decongestant, I suppose. And a cough suppressant, the cherry flavored one. I don’t memorize brand names; they all do the same thing, don’t they? Red box, maybe? I really don't see how that matters. I’m telling you what happened, not giving you a pharmaceutical inventory. Is this standard procedure?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Firestone. It’s not about creating an inventory; it’s about understanding everything that could be relevant. Sometimes medications have side effects, or interactions that can contribute to symptoms. Knowing what you took helps me build a complete picture. But we can move on if you prefer. You said the weakness was sudden. Is it in both legs, or just one?
PATIENT: Fine, move on. Honestly, the whole thing is rather… undignified. Yes, it’s both legs, Doctor. Both. Equally weak. Like… like someone turned off a switch. I couldn’t even stand to finish getting dressed properly. Had to practically crawl to the sofa. And it’s not improving, which is the most irritating part of the whole ordeal. I have a reputation to maintain, you know. Tours don’t run themselves.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern about maintaining your reputation and keeping your tours running. It’s good to know it’s both legs equally affected, and that it hasn't improved. Do you have any pain associated with the weakness?
PATIENT: Pain? No, not exactly. It’s not painful. It’s just… heavy. And… floppy. Like trying to control wet noodles. There's a little ache, perhaps, if I try to stand for too long – which, admittedly, isn’t very long at all these days. But it’s not a sharp pain, or a burning sensation, or anything dramatic. More of a… dull discomfort. It’s the inability to function that’s bothersome, not the discomfort. Honestly, Doctor, it's a rather ridiculous situation.
DOCTOR: Okay, heavy, floppy, with a dull ache when trying to stand. No sharp or burning pain. Now, I’m going to ask a few questions about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, like diabetes, high blood pressure, or arthritis?
PATIENT: Oh, please. I’m perfectly healthy, thank you very much. I eat reasonably, I walk when I can, and I don’t spend my life indulging in… unhealthy habits. No diabetes, no high blood pressure, no arthritis. None of that nonsense. I’ve always been… robust, let’s say. I’ve had the occasional cold, obviously, but nothing serious. My mother, now she had problems with her joints… but that’s hardly relevant, is it? This is all rather… intrusive.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern about the intrusiveness of these questions, Ms. Firestone. However, family history can be relevant. We’ll come back to that. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Surgeries? No. Hospitalized? Once, when I was a child. Appendicitis. A very long time ago. Nothing since. I pride myself on being… self-sufficient, you see. I don’t require constant medical attention. And frankly, the thought of being stuck in one of those… establishments… is rather unpleasant. I prefer to handle things myself whenever possible. This leg situation is… exceptionally frustrating, because I can’t handle it myself.
DOCTOR: Okay, appendectomy as a child, otherwise no surgeries or hospitalizations. Now, let’s talk about any medications you currently take, besides the over-the-counter cold remedies. Any vitamins, supplements, or herbal remedies?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, are you quite finished with the interrogation? I told you, I don't take medications. I maintain a sensible diet and get sufficient rest. Vitamins? Occasionally, a multivitamin, if I remember. But nothing regularly, and certainly no… herbal remedies. I have no patience for that sort of thing. It’s all rather… superstitious. This is getting ridiculous. I came in here because my legs won't work, not to catalogue my entire lifestyle for your amusement.
DOCTOR: I apologize again if this feels like an interrogation, Ms. Firestone. I assure you I’m simply trying to gather all the necessary information to understand what's going on. It's helpful to know what you aren't taking as well as what you are. Okay. Finally, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. None. I eat everything. I’ve traveled extensively, Doctor, you learn to be… adaptable. No allergies to medications either. I've never experienced any adverse reactions. Honestly, I’m starting to suspect you’re deliberately trying to irritate me. This is a waste of my time. I have tours to reschedule, you know. This whole situation is… profoundly inconvenient.
DOCTOR: Alright, no allergies, no regular medications, no significant medical history. Okay, Ms. Firestone. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical exam. I'll check your reflexes, strength, and sensation in your legs, and listen to your heart and lungs. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Oh, fine. Get it over with. Honestly, poking and prodding isn’t going to magically fix my legs, is it? But if you must. Just try to be quick about it. I have a reputation to maintain, you know. And I’d prefer not to spend the entire afternoon in this… establishment. But do be gentle. I haven’t had a proper leg massage in ages, and I’m not about to start now.
DOCTOR: I will be as quick and gentle as possible, Ms. Firestone. "Okay, Ms. Firestone, I’m checking your reflexes now. Patellar reflex on the right… 2 plus, which is normal. And on the left… also 2 plus, normal. Achilles reflex on the right… 2 plus. And on the left… 2 plus as well. All reflexes are equal and within normal limits." "Now, I’m going to ask you to resist my pressure as I try to move your legs. Can you try to push your leg down as I push up?
PATIENT: It's… difficult. Very difficult. They feel… weak, obviously. Like trying to push against a heavy weight. But I am pushing. I assure you, I'm exerting effort. Don't underestimate me, Doctor. I spend my days leading tours, you know. It requires a certain amount of… stamina. And resistance. Though admittedly, not usually against a… physician. It’s… straining. Frankly, it’s quite irritating to be subjected to this… ordeal. Are you getting a clear reading? Because I’m certainly pushing. And I'm starting to feel rather… humiliated.
DOCTOR: "I appreciate your effort, Ms. Firestone. And you are right to point out the weakness. It is noticeable. Strength is 3 out of 5 in both legs. Meaning you can move your legs against gravity, but with some difficulty. Now, I’m going to check your sensation. Can you tell me if you feel this when I touch you here?
PATIENT: "3 out of 5? Is that… good or bad? You doctors and your cryptic numbers. And yes, I feel it. Perfectly well. Though it doesn't mean much, does it? I can feel a fly landing on my leg, but it doesn't change the fact that I can barely stand. Honestly, this whole exercise is rather… pointless. I came in here for a diagnosis, not a numerical assessment of my sensation. Are you any closer to figuring out why my legs won’t work? Because frankly, I’m wasting my time. And my valuable energy."
DOCTOR: "You’re right to ask, Ms. Firestone. And I apologize for the cryptic numbers. It's just a way for me to document my findings objectively. Sensation is intact in both legs, which is good. That rules out some possibilities. Based on what you’ve told me, and the physical exam findings – sudden onset of weakness, normal reflexes and sensation, weakness graded 3 out of 5 – a few things come to mind. Given the timing after a cold, it’s possible this is Guillain-Barré syndrome, a rare autoimmune condition that affects the nerves. However, other possibilities include transverse myelitis, or even a more straightforward nerve compression. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order some blood tests and an MRI of your spine. The blood tests will help us look for signs of inflammation or infection, and the MRI will help us see if there’s any damage to your spinal cord."
PATIENT: "Blood tests? An MRI? You’re talking about… serious tests. For legs that won’t work? Honestly, Doctor, are you quite sure? I mean, I had a cold. A perfectly ordinary cold. It doesn’t sound like… Guillain-whatsit. Or whatever the other thing was. And an MRI? That sounds… unpleasant. Confined spaces and… machines. I don't appreciate this at all. Can't we just… try something simpler? Some physical therapy, perhaps? Or a stronger vitamin supplement? I'm not convinced I need all these… invasive procedures. This is getting ridiculous. And profoundly inconvenient."
DOCTOR: “I understand your hesitation, Ms. Firestone, and I wouldn’t recommend these tests if I didn’t think they were necessary. While physical therapy can be helpful, it won’t address the underlying cause of the weakness. It's important to rule out serious conditions like Guillain-Barré syndrome or transverse myelitis, because they require prompt treatment to prevent permanent damage. The MRI is the best way to visualize your spinal cord and identify any abnormalities. We can take measures to make you comfortable during the procedure – you can listen to music, and the technicians will ensure you're not confined for too long. If the tests come back negative, then we can explore other possibilities, like nerve compression, and focus on a more conservative treatment plan. But we need to have a clear picture of what’s going on before we can proceed. Would you like me to explain the tests in more detail?
PATIENT: "Oh, alright. Explain them. But keep it brief, please. And don’t use too many… technical terms. I’m a tour guide, not a physician. I need to understand what’s involved, what the risks are, and how long it’s going to take. Honestly, this is a complete disruption to my schedule. I have tours to reschedule, you know. And my clients are… demanding. The thought of being stuck in a… machine… for an extended period is frankly, appalling. But if it’s absolutely necessary… explain it. Quickly."
DOCTOR: “The blood tests are fairly straightforward. We'll take a sample from your arm and send it to the lab to check for signs of inflammation, infection, or antibodies that might suggest an autoimmune condition. It usually takes a couple of days to get the results. The MRI, or magnetic resonance imaging, uses strong magnets and radio waves to create detailed images of your spinal cord. You'll lie on a table that slides into a large, tunnel-shaped machine. It's important to remain very still during the scan, which takes about 30-45 minutes. You’ll have headphones so you can listen to music and communicate with the technician. There are no ionizing radiations involved, so it’s generally very safe. We’ll ask about any metal implants you have beforehand. The main risk is claustrophobia, which is why we can offer a mild sedative if you’re feeling anxious. If you agree, I’ll order both tests and schedule them for as soon as possible. In the meantime, it's important to avoid strenuous activity and protect your legs from injury. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: "No metal implants. Thankfully. And I suppose 30 minutes isn’t… the end of the world. Though I do hate confined spaces. And the thought of lying perfectly still for that long is… unsettling. But alright. Order the tests. Get it over with. But schedule them for as early in the week as possible. I can’t afford to be incapacitated for too long. My clients are… very impatient. And make sure the technician is… efficient. I don't want to be stuck in that… machine… any longer than necessary. And what happens after the tests? When do we get the results? And what if it is something serious? Don’t sugarcoat it, Doctor. I need to know the worst-case scenario. Honestly, this is all rather… overwhelming."
DOCTOR: “I understand your anxiety, Ms. Firestone. I’ll schedule the tests for as early in the week as possible, and I’ll make a note to ensure the technician is efficient. The results typically take 24-48 hours to come back. Once I have them, I’ll contact you immediately to discuss them. If the tests reveal something serious, like Guillain-Barré syndrome or transverse myelitis, treatment options include intravenous immunoglobulin therapy or high-dose steroids to suppress the immune system. The earlier we start treatment, the better the chances of a full recovery. We would likely involve a neurologist for ongoing care. However, it’s important to remember that the tests may also come back negative, in which case we’ll explore other possibilities. For now, let’s focus on getting the tests done. I’ll have my assistant schedule them for you and provide you with all the necessary instructions. Do you have any other questions at this time?
PATIENT: “Intravenous… whatsit? And steroids? Honestly, the thought of being poked and prodded with… medical interventions… is appalling. But alright. Schedule the tests. But please, keep me informed. I don’t want to be left in the dark. And make sure the assistant is… competent. I don’t have time for incompetence. Honestly, this is a complete disruption to my life. But… alright. Do what you have to do. But keep me informed, please. And try to be as quick as possible. I have tours to reschedule, you know.”
DOCTOR: “I understand your concerns, Ms. Firestone, and I assure you, I’ll keep you informed every step of the way. My assistant, Sarah, is very competent and will schedule the tests for as soon as possible. She’ll also explain the preparation instructions in detail. I’ll also provide you with my direct contact information, so you can reach out to me if you have any questions or concerns. Thank you for your patience and cooperation. I hope we can get a clear diagnosis and start treatment soon.” “I’ll have Sarah come in now to schedule the tests. Please let me know if you need anything else.”
