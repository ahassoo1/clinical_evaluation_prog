DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Shteynberg. I'm Dr. Nooruddin. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Look, Doctor, let’s just cut to the chase. I want a baby. A healthy one. And I don't have time to waste on…problems. I’m 51, not 80. I expect things to work.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, wanting a healthy baby is perfectly understandable at any age. But it's a bit more…complex than simply expecting things to work, unfortunately. So, let’s get some details. Have you been trying for a while now?
PATIENT: Trying? Doctor, I’ve been…strategically attempting with a…companion for the last six months. Six months is long enough, isn't it? I shouldn’t need to be here if everything was as it should be. And frankly, I find the implication that I'm not doing it "right" rather insulting.
DOCTOR: I assure you, Ms. Shteynberg, I didn't mean to imply anything of the sort. Six months can be a reasonable timeframe to start looking into things, especially with…considerations for your age. It’s simply that fertility naturally declines with age. Now, have you had any pregnancies previously?
PATIENT: Yes. One. Thirty years ago. It was…difficult. Long labor, complications. Ended in a C-section. Why does that even matter? It was decades ago. My body is perfectly capable, I assure you. I maintain a very strict regimen. I eat organic everything, I cycle 50 kilometers a week…it’s not like I’m…inactive.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful. And a previous C-section can sometimes affect future pregnancies, so it's good to know. We'll need to review your records, but for now, let's talk about your cycles. Are they regular?
PATIENT: Regular enough. They come when they come. What does “regular” even mean to you, Doctor? I don’t chart everything, I have a life. Though, truthfully, the last few have been…spotty. A bit lighter than usual, maybe? And further apart. But really, it’s nothing to be alarmed about, I’m certain. It’s probably just…stress.
DOCTOR: "Spotty" and "further apart" are things to be aware of, Ms. Shteynberg, even if you feel it's stress-related. It’s important to be thorough. Are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, are you implying something is wrong with me? I feel perfectly fine. A little tired, perhaps. But who isn’t tired? And maybe a bit…irritable. But that’s my ex-husband’s fault, not a medical condition. Is this going to be a long appointment? I have a bicycle repair to finish this afternoon.
DOCTOR: Ms. Shteynberg, fatigue and irritability can be associated with a number of things, and it’s my job to investigate all possibilities. While I appreciate you’re busy, a full assessment is important. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Do you have any chronic conditions like high blood pressure or diabetes?
PATIENT: No. Absolutely not. I told you, I'm very careful about my health. I get regular check-ups, I eat well, I exercise... I'm in better shape than most women half my age. Though, my mother had…something with her blood sugar. But that was years ago. She ate too many pastries, if you ask me. It wasn't a serious condition. Does that matter? Really? I just want to know if I can have a healthy baby, not rehash my family medical history.
DOCTOR: It does matter, Ms. Shteynberg. Family history can provide important clues. Now, are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Just a multivitamin. And occasionally ibuprofen for…sore muscles from cycling. That’s it. I don’t believe in loading up on pharmaceuticals. They just mask the problem, don’t fix it. And honestly, I find this line of questioning rather…patronizing. Are you suspecting I’m some sort of…unhealthy mess? I assure you, I am perfectly capable of maintaining my own well-being. Now, can we please get to the part where you tell me if this is going to work or not? I have a life to get back to.
DOCTOR: Ms. Shteynberg, I understand your frustration. However, a proper assessment requires gathering information, not making assumptions. Given your age and the information you've provided – a previous C-section, irregular cycles, potential family history of blood sugar issues – it would be prudent to run some blood tests. These will assess your hormone levels, check for any underlying conditions, and give us a clearer picture of your overall health and fertility. Would you be agreeable to that?
PATIENT: Fine! Whatever. Just get it over with. But don’t expect me to sit around for hours while you poke and prod. I have commitments. And if it’s just going to tell me what I already know—that I’m getting older—I’m walking out. Do we understand each other? Now, where do I sign?
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Shteynberg, we understand each other. We’ll keep things as efficient as possible. The nurse will draw some blood now. The tests will take a few days to come back. We can then discuss the results and formulate a plan. In the meantime, I'd like to take your vitals and do a brief physical exam, if you're agreeable. It's just a standard procedure.
PATIENT: Just get it over with. And quickly. I have a rare Italian bicycle frame I need to restore. Don’t waste my time. .
