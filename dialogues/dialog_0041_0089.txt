DOCTOR: Hi Alese, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Polczynski. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It’s… a pleasure to meet you as well. Let me see… well, it’s this pain, really. Down low. In my abdomen. It comes and goes, but when it does come… it’s quite something. I believe it’s been happening more frequently lately, and that's why I thought I should come in. I’m afraid my memory isn’t what it used to be, so details… they’re a bit fuzzy. But it’s concerning.
DOCTOR: Okay, abdominal pain. I understand. And you said it's been happening more frequently recently?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. More frequent… and perhaps a little more intense each time, though I could be imagining that. It’s difficult to say, honestly. It’s not constant, mind you. There are days where I feel perfectly fine, and then… suddenly, it’s there again. It’s just… unsettling. And I do have… well, I was told I have something called SLE. Is that right? It’s been a while since I’ve spoken to anyone about it.
DOCTOR: SLE, or Systemic Lupus Erythematosus. Yes, I see that in your chart. And it’s good you mentioned that. Sometimes abdominal pain can be related to lupus, or the medications used to treat it. When you say "comes and goes," can you describe the pain a little more?
PATIENT: Oh dear, yes, lupus… it’s a complicated thing, isn’t it? I suppose I should try to be more specific. Well, when it comes… it’s like a cramping, really. A deep, aching cramp. And sometimes it feels… sharp? Like little stabs. It’s hard to explain. It’s not a pain that radiates, not usually. It stays… localized. Down there. And it can last… oh, a few hours, sometimes. Then it just… fades. It’s… rather inconvenient, to be frank. I'm not sure if that helps at all.
DOCTOR: That does help, actually. Cramping, aching, sometimes sharp… localized to your lower abdomen. A few hours at a time. And is there anything that seems to trigger the pain?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s a good question. Let me think… I haven’t noticed anything specific, no. It doesn’t seem to be related to what I eat, or how much I’m moving around. I’ve tried to keep track, but it seems… random. Sometimes it happens after a perfectly normal day, and other times it comes when I’m feeling quite stressed. Though, I suppose I’m always a little stressed these days. Is that helpful? I do apologize for being so vague. It’s just… difficult to pinpoint.
DOCTOR: No apology needed at all, Alese. It is often difficult to pinpoint these things. Stress can certainly play a role, you're right. Now, I see here you mentioned SLE. Are you currently taking any medications for that, or for anything else?
PATIENT: Oh yes, the medications. Let me see… I am. I take… hmm. There's a white pill, and a small blue one, and sometimes a larger pink capsule. I believe one is for the lupus itself, to keep things… quiet. And the other… I believe it helps with the joints. They ache terribly sometimes, you see. I’m afraid I don’t recall the names of them. I have a list at home, I’m sure of it, but it didn’t occur to me to bring it. I do apologize again. My daughter usually manages all of that for me.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright. Medication lists can be tricky. We can certainly get the names later, no problem. Do you know the dosages of any of those medications?
PATIENT: Oh dear, dosages… that is a bit beyond me, I’m afraid. I simply take them as instructed. The white one, I believe, is once a day. The blue one… perhaps twice? And the pink capsule… only when needed, I think. When the pain gets particularly bad. It’s all rather… hazy, you see. I rely heavily on my daughter for these things. She's very organized. I wish I were more like her. I feel terribly inefficient explaining all of this.
DOCTOR: You’re not inefficient at all, Alese. It sounds like you have a good support system with your daughter. It’s good to know that you have someone helping you manage things. Now, I'd like to ask about some other symptoms, just to get a broader picture. Have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits recently?
PATIENT: Oh. Bowel habits… hmm. Let me think. Well, nothing drastic, no. Perhaps a little… irregular? Sometimes a bit… loose, and other times… a little more… firm. It’s not a constant thing, and I haven’t noticed any… blood, thankfully. It’s just not as… predictable as it used to be. I apologize for being so… graphic. I’m not very good at discussing these personal matters. It's just... not something one talks about, you see.
DOCTOR: You’re not being graphic at all, Alese. It’s important information, and I appreciate you sharing it with me. Irregular bowel habits… that’s good to know. Have you noticed any fever, chills, or night sweats recently?
PATIENT: Oh, fever… let me think. I haven’t taken my temperature, but I do feel rather warm sometimes, particularly in the evenings. Not necessarily a fever, but… flushed, perhaps? And yes, I have been waking up… a little damp, yes. Night sweats, I believe they’re called. It’s not every night, but it’s happened a few times recently. I usually just chalk it up to the warm weather, but perhaps it’s something more? I do apologize for being so… unhelpful. I wish I could be more precise. It’s just… everything feels a bit muddled these days.
DOCTOR: You are not being unhelpful at all, Alese. These details are very helpful, thank you. Flushing and night sweats… that’s good to know. Okay. And finally, have you experienced any unintentional weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Oh. Weight loss… hmm. That’s a difficult one. I haven’t been weighing myself regularly, I’m afraid. But… looking back, my clothes do feel a little looser than they used to. Not a dramatic amount, but… noticeable. I haven't been eating much less, so I suppose it's possible. I do tend to lose my appetite when I’m feeling unwell, and I've been feeling rather unwell lately, to be honest. It’s just… a subtle change, really. Nothing alarming, I don’t think. Though, perhaps I should be more concerned? I do apologize for being so vague. It’s just… difficult to say for certain. Everything feels a bit… distant these days.
DOCTOR: You are not being vague at all, Alese. It’s perfectly alright to not be certain. Weight loss, even subtle, is something we want to investigate. Alright. Thank you for sharing all of that with me. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. Just to listen to your abdomen, feel for any tenderness, and check a few other things. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course, Doctor. A physical exam sounds perfectly reasonable. I trust your judgment implicitly. Please, do whatever you need to do. I’m happy to cooperate in any way I can. I just… hope it’s nothing too serious. But I suppose that's what you're here for, isn't it? To find out. Please, don't hesitate to ask if you need me to do anything. I just want to feel better, you see. It's been a long time since I've felt… myself.
DOCTOR: Alright. I'm going to start by listening to your abdomen with my stethoscope. It might be a little cool. Just relax and breathe normally. Okay… bowel sounds are present, though a little… diminished. Not overly concerning at this point, but we’ll keep that in mind. And now I’m going to gently feel your abdomen. Please let me know if you feel any tenderness or pain in any specific area. Okay… I'm noticing a little tenderness here, on your lower left side. Is that where you typically feel the pain?
PATIENT: Oh. Yes, actually. That’s… precisely where it hurts the most. Not always, mind you, but… when it’s bad, that’s where I feel it. A dull ache, mostly. Sometimes sharp, like little stabs, as I mentioned before. Is that… bad, Doctor? I do apologize for being so anxious. I just… worry, you see. It’s been a long time since I’ve felt truly comfortable. It’s just… unsettling, not knowing what’s going on. Is it something serious? Please, be honest with me. I can handle it. I just want to know.
DOCTOR: Okay. It's good that the tenderness corresponds with where you're experiencing the pain. It doesn't necessarily mean it's something serious, but it does help us narrow things down. Given your history of SLE, the irregular bowel habits, night sweats, weight loss, and the tenderness here, there are a few possibilities we need to consider. It could be related to a flare-up of your lupus, potentially affecting your digestive system. It could also be something like diverticulitis, an inflammation or infection of small pouches in the colon. Or, less likely, but we need to rule it out, it could be something else entirely. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to order a few tests. A complete blood count to check for inflammation, a comprehensive metabolic panel to assess your kidney and liver function, a stool sample to check for any infection, and a CT scan of your abdomen to get a detailed image of your organs. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh my. That sounds… quite extensive, Doctor. But… if that’s what’s needed, then yes, of course. Please, do whatever you deem necessary. I trust your judgment implicitly. A CT scan… will that be painful? And the stool sample… well, it’s rather… unpleasant, isn’t it? But I’ll do it. I promise. Anything to find out what’s going on. A flare-up… that would explain a lot, wouldn’t it? I just… hope it’s not too serious. And if it’s not lupus… what then? I do apologize for being so anxious. It’s just… unsettling, not knowing what’s going on. Please, be honest with me. I can handle it. I just want to feel better, you see. It’s been a long time since I’ve felt… myself.
DOCTOR: You're not being anxious at all, Alese. It's perfectly normal to feel this way. And you're right, a flare-up is definitely a possibility, and that's something we need to investigate first. The CT scan is painless. You'll lie on a table and a machine will take images. It's quick and doesn't involve any needles. As for the stool sample… yes, it’s not the most pleasant thing, but it’s a valuable test. The lab will give you instructions on how to collect it properly. If it's not lupus, or a flare-up, we'll look at other possibilities based on the test results. Diverticulitis is one we need to rule out, but there are other things it could be. We'll take it one step at a time, and I'll explain everything clearly as we go. I'll have the lab orders sent electronically to the lab near your home. They'll contact you to schedule the tests. Once we have the results, we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and create a plan. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… perfectly alright, Doctor. Sending the orders electronically is very convenient. And scheduling a follow-up appointment is… reassuring. Knowing there’s a plan… that helps. I do appreciate your patience with me. And your kindness. It’s been a long time since I’ve felt truly listened to. I believe that’s everything for now, then? I should probably get going. I do apologize for taking up so much of your time. And thank you, again, Doctor. For everything. I just… hope it’s nothing too serious. But I trust your judgment implicitly. .
DOCTOR: You haven't taken up any time at all, Alese. It's my job to listen, and I'm glad I could help. Please, don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. And remember, we'll take it one step at a time. I'm here to help you feel better. Alright. Take care, and I'll see you soon.
