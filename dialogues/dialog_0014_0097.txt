DOCTOR: Alright, Marija, good to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good day to you, Doctor Osterholm. I believe you have my file? I am here regarding… well, a document I was advised to obtain. Something about making sure my wishes are known, should… an unfortunate event occur. A friend suggested an “Advance Directive” or a “POLST” form. I confess, I find the whole topic rather… unpleasant, but I suppose it's best to be prepared.
DOCTOR: Yes, yes, I see it here. Advance Directive…POLST… Right. Look, a lot of people put off these things. It’s…morbid, isn’t it?
PATIENT: Precisely! It feels rather… presumptuous, doesn’t it? To contemplate such matters. I am a professor of literature, you see. We deal in the beauty of life, not the…mechanics of its ending. But my husband insists, and he is a very…practical man. So, I thought I would simply get this done. Perhaps you could explain what is involved? I haven’t the faintest idea where to begin.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, it’s basically paperwork. Legal stuff. The Advance Directive is a general outline of what you want, should you be unable to speak for yourself. The POLST – Physician Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment – is more specific. It’s a medical order. Honestly, most people don't need a POLST unless they’re already seriously ill. We’ll probably focus on the Advance Directive for now. Do you have any specific wishes already in mind?
PATIENT: Hmm. Specific wishes… I hadn’t quite thought that far ahead. I suppose… I would not want to be kept alive artificially if there was no hope of recovery. Prolonging suffering seems…undignified. But beyond that, I am rather unsure. I trust my doctors, naturally. And my husband, of course. He would know what I would want. Perhaps the form has some… suggestions? Or examples? It all feels very overwhelming.
DOCTOR: There are checkboxes, mostly. It asks about things like resuscitation, mechanical ventilation, feeding tubes…standard stuff. Look, it's not like you're signing your life away. It just gives your husband and the medical team some guidance. It's more for their benefit, honestly. Saves everyone a lot of stress. Here. Take a look. It's fairly straightforward. Do you want me to walk you through each section, or would you prefer to read it over first?
PATIENT: Oh dear. It is rather…detailed, isn’t it? All these medical terms… "intubation," "tracheostomy"... I feel quite lost already. Perhaps walking me through it would be best. I confess, I am not very good with…technical jargon. And honestly, I find the whole concept a bit… upsetting. It's all rather morbid, as I mentioned. But if you would be so kind as to explain it to me, I suppose I can try. Starting with… what exactly is resuscitation?
DOCTOR: Resuscitation. It’s…CPR. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Chest compressions, potentially electric shock if your heart stops. It’s what you see on TV. It's… aggressive. And not always successful. It can break ribs, cause other complications. It's a bit… dramatic, honestly. The form asks if you want it done if you stop breathing or your heart stops. Do you want us to attempt to bring you back, or do you prefer…comfort care?
PATIENT: Comfort care… That sounds… preferable, I suppose. If there is truly no hope… prolonging the inevitable seems rather pointless. And as you say, the…aggressiveness of resuscitation sounds rather unpleasant. Is it… common for people to request it? I feel rather…contrary, opting for comfort care. Most people surely want every possible chance, don’t they? It feels rather… defeatist, to be frank. But if it avoids unnecessary suffering, then yes, I suppose I would prefer comfort care. Though I still feel rather…unsettled about it all. It's a rather grim topic, isn't it?
DOCTOR: It's not uncommon. More people are choosing it, actually. Especially as they get older. Look, it's your decision. And frankly, a lot of the time, resuscitation doesn't work. It's just… a lot of fuss for nothing. It's good you're thinking about this. Most people don’t. Alright, next is mechanical ventilation. That's a breathing machine. If you can't breathe on your own, we put a tube down your throat and the machine does the work for you. It's…not comfortable. Long-term ventilation is… well, it’s not a good quality of life, generally. Do you want us to attempt that if you're unable to breathe?
PATIENT: Oh dear. A tube down the throat… That sounds… dreadful. I confess, I have a rather…sensitive constitution. The thought of being unable to breathe… and then that… No, no, absolutely not. I do not want mechanical ventilation. It sounds… barbaric. I trust your judgment, Doctor, but I would rather… not prolong my life in that manner. It seems…undignified, to be reliant on a machine. Though I hesitate to say it, it all sounds rather…horrific. Is there anything else quite so… invasive? I would prefer to know what I am agreeing to, or rather, refusing. It’s all rather… distressing, to be frank. Perhaps I should have remained ignorant of these… options.
DOCTOR: There's feeding tubes, dialysis if your kidneys fail… standard end-of-life stuff. Honestly, most of it you won't need. You’re healthy now. This is just… covering all the bases. You’ve already made the important decisions, really. No ventilation, no resuscitation. That's good enough. We’ll document your wishes. Your husband will need to sign it as your healthcare proxy. He can make decisions if you’re unable to. Do you have any questions for me?
PATIENT: No, I believe that is all. You have been most…patient with my…trepidation. And I appreciate you explaining it all so clearly, despite my…lack of medical knowledge. I suppose it is a relief to have it documented, and to know my wishes are… recorded. Yes. As long as my husband is aware, and understands my… preferences, then I feel… sufficiently reassured. Perhaps we can change the subject now? I am a professor of literature, you see. Perhaps we could discuss a particularly interesting novel? Though I understand you are a very busy woman.
DOCTOR: Look, I’m a doctor, not a book club facilitator. I appreciate your… enthusiasm, but I have other patients. I’ll have the paperwork ready for your husband to sign. He can come in any time. Is there anything medical I can help you with today?
PATIENT: Oh. Yes, of course. Forgive me. I… sometimes get carried away. No, that is all. The paperwork for my husband will suffice. Thank you again for your time, Doctor Osterholm. And for your… patience. I will leave it to you, then. .
DOCTOR: Right. Have a good day.
