DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Meigs. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Tosca. It's nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. My back… it’s really bad. Hurts a lot. It’s been hurting for a while now, but it’s gotten worse this last week, maybe two weeks. It makes it hard to… well, to do anything, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Back pain that's been getting worse over the last couple of weeks. That certainly sounds uncomfortable. To help me get a better understanding of what's going on, could you tell me a little more about the pain itself?
PATIENT: Hmm… how to explain. It’s not like a quick sharp pain. It's more… a constant ache. Like a heavy weight is always on my back. And sometimes, when I try to stand up or bend over, it gets really sharp, like someone is sticking me with a needle. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. A constant ache with sharp pains when you move – that's helpful. And where exactly on your back are you feeling this pain?
PATIENT: It's… lower back, mostly. Right around here. Sometimes it feels like it goes all the way around, but it starts there. And sometimes, I feel it in my… my leg, a little bit. Down the back of my leg. Not all the way to my foot, just… the back of my leg.
DOCTOR: Okay, lower back pain, primarily on the left side, radiating somewhat down the back of your leg. That sounds like it could be involving the sciatic nerve. Before we go further, have you experienced any numbness or tingling in your leg or foot?
PATIENT: Sciatic… what now? Numbness… hmm. Not really numbness. But sometimes my leg feels… weak. Like it’s going to give out when I walk. And yeah, sometimes a little tingly, like when your foot falls asleep, but not all the time.
DOCTOR: Okay, weakness and occasional tingling – good to know. Now, has anything specific caused this pain to start, or did it come on gradually?
PATIENT: That's a hard question. It didn't start with anything big. It just… got worse over time. I do remember… a few months ago, I was helping my nephew move some boxes. They were really heavy, and I bent over wrong, I think. But it wasn't that bad at first. Just a little sore. But it never really went away, and then it started getting worse and worse.
DOCTOR: Okay, so lifting heavy boxes a few months ago, which may have been the initial trigger, and then a gradual worsening of the pain over time. Do you recall how long after lifting the boxes the pain started?
PATIENT: Hmm… not long, I don't think. Maybe a day or two. It wasn't bad at first, like just a little ache after working. But then, a week later, it still hurt. And another week later, it was harder to get out of bed. I just thought I pulled something. You know, like a muscle.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. It sounds like it began shortly after the lifting incident, initially as a muscle ache, and then gradually worsened. Now, let's talk a little bit about your medical history. Have you had any back problems before this?
PATIENT: No, not really. I’ve had aches and pains, like everyone, but nothing like this. But… I do have… cancer. They found it last year. It’s in my… my lungs. I've been getting treatment, but… it hasn't been easy.
DOCTOR: Thank you for letting me know, Ms. Meigs. That's important information. And I appreciate you sharing that with me. I’m so sorry to hear about your diagnosis, and it’s understandable that treatment can be difficult. Knowing that you're undergoing cancer treatment changes how we need to approach this back pain. Are you currently receiving any specific treatments – chemotherapy, radiation, anything like that?
PATIENT: Yes. I get… the medicine through the vein. Chemo, I think it's called. And they did radiation a few months ago. It helped a little with… the breathing, but… the back pain wasn’t part of it before. It just started getting bad now.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you're currently receiving chemotherapy and previously underwent radiation therapy. It's important to determine if the back pain could be related to the cancer itself, or a side effect of the treatment, or something separate. Do you know if your cancer has spread to your bones?
PATIENT: Bones? I… I don’t know. They did a lot of tests when they first found it. Scans and… and things. They told me where it was in my lungs, but I don't remember them saying anything about my bones. Should they have told me?
DOCTOR: That’s a very good question, Ms. Meigs. They absolutely should have discussed any findings regarding bone involvement with you. To be sure, let me quickly check your electronic health record to see the results of those previous scans. …Okay, I see here that a bone scan was performed last November. And it did show some areas of concern in your spine. It wasn't definitive, and they recommended follow-up, but it wasn't explicitly ruled out.
PATIENT: Oh. So… the cancer might be in my back? That’s why it hurts? Is that bad? I just thought it was from… everything else.
DOCTOR: It’s understandable to be worried, Ms. Meigs. It's possible that the pain is related to the cancer spreading to your spine, but we need more information to confirm that. The initial bone scan showed some areas of concern, as I mentioned, and the fact that you're undergoing cancer treatment makes this a higher probability. We need to determine the extent of the involvement, if any. I’d like to order an MRI of your spine to get a clearer picture of what’s going on. That will help us see if the cancer has spread to your vertebrae and is causing your pain. In the meantime, we also need to rule out other potential causes. Would you be comfortable with me conducting a brief physical exam now?
PATIENT: MRI… okay. If that’s what you think is best. And yes, okay, you can do the exam. I want to know what’s going on. I just… I just want it to stop hurting.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Meigs. We'll do our best to figure this out and get you some relief. Okay, let's start with the exam. Could you please lie down on your back on the examination table?
PATIENT: Okay. It's a little cold, but that's alright. Just tell me what you need me to do.
DOCTOR: Thank you. Okay, I'm just going to gently press on different areas of your back. Please let me know if anything is particularly painful. And then I'll have you try to bend forward and backward, and side to side. There's tenderness on your left lower back, as you mentioned. And it seems like bending forward causes more discomfort. Your reflexes are normal, and your strength is intact, but there's some mild restriction in your range of motion. This could be due to muscle spasm or inflammation. Your leg reflexes are also normal, and your sensation is intact. This doesn't suggest any major nerve compression at this time, but it's important to monitor for any changes. Okay, that's all for the physical exam. Thank you for your patience.
PATIENT: Okay. It didn't hurt too bad, but… yeah, that left side really feels tight. What does this mean? Is it… bad?
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Meigs. The exam findings – the tenderness, restricted range of motion, and muscle tightness – are consistent with either a muscle strain, inflammation, or involvement of the spine itself. Given your history of cancer and the bone scan results, we need to investigate further, and that's why I'm ordering the MRI. It’s too early to say definitively whether it’s “bad,” but we are taking this seriously and are working to get a clear diagnosis. The MRI will help us determine the extent of any potential involvement of the spine. In the meantime, I can prescribe a mild muscle relaxant and an anti-inflammatory medication to help manage your pain and discomfort. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Yes, please. Anything to help with the pain. It's just… it’s hard to do anything when it hurts all the time. Muscle relaxant and… the anti-inflammatory, right? That sounds good. Will it make me sleepy? I need to take care of my nephew sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, I'll prescribe both a muscle relaxant – cyclobenzaprine – and an anti-inflammatory medication – naproxen. Cyclobenzaprine can cause some drowsiness, especially initially, so it's best to take it at bedtime. We can start with a low dose and see how you tolerate it. And naproxen is generally well-tolerated, but it's important to take it with food to avoid stomach upset. I’ll also send a referral to oncology to review these findings with your cancer doctor to discuss the next steps for treatment. Now, do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, I don't have any allergies that I know of. I’ve taken medicine before, and everything was alright. But thank you for asking. And… how long does it take to get the MRI?
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know about the allergies. Regarding the MRI, I'll send the order to the radiology department immediately. Typically, it takes a few days to a week to schedule and complete the MRI, depending on their availability. They will call you directly to schedule the appointment. I'll also have my nurse contact them to expedite the process if possible, given your situation. In the meantime, please continue taking the muscle relaxant and anti-inflammatory as prescribed, and try to avoid any strenuous activity. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s everything. Thank you, Doctor. You explained everything really well, and I feel… a little bit better, knowing we're doing something to find out what’s wrong.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Meigs. I'm glad I could provide some reassurance. We are going to work through this together. My nurse will come in shortly to give you the prescriptions and go over the discharge instructions in more detail. She can also answer any questions you may have. Please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic if you experience any worsening of your symptoms or have any concerns before your MRI appointment. Take care, Ms. Meigs.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. I will.
