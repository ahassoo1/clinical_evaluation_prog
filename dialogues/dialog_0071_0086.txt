DOCTOR: Good morning, Kahrin. I'm Dr. Galena. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Right, good morning. Just here for the results, if you don't mind getting straight to it. I’m a bit pressed for time, actually.
DOCTOR: Yes, of course. Results... right. Let me pull those up now. Hmm… yes. Okay. Before we jump into what the results are, just to be thorough, can you remind me what we were testing for?
PATIENT: Testing? Oh. Right, the… the thing with the tiredness. And the… headaches, I guess. The blood test. Honestly, I don't remember all the specifics, Dr. Galena. It was a lot. I just wanted to know if it was anything serious.
DOCTOR: Okay, tiredness and headaches… yes, I remember now. We ran some fairly standard blood work, just to rule things out. It was a fair bit, I apologize if it felt overwhelming. Let's see… Your complete blood count came back normal, thankfully. No signs of anemia or infection. Your thyroid levels were also within the normal range. Vitamin D is a little low, which is pretty common, especially this time of year. But… there’s a slightly elevated ESR. An erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Does that mean anything to you?
PATIENT: ESR? Nope, doesn’t ring a bell. Is that… bad? Low vitamin D I can handle, I mean, I can take something for that. But "slightly elevated…" that sounds concerning. What does that mean, exactly?
DOCTOR: Right, yes. It's not necessarily bad, per se. An elevated ESR just means there’s some inflammation in your body. It’s a non-specific marker, meaning it doesn’t tell us where the inflammation is coming from. Lots of things can cause it – even something as simple as a cold, or… well, a lot of things. It could be nothing. But we should investigate a bit further just to be sure. Do you have any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… Hmm. Not really, not that I’ve noticed. A little achy sometimes, maybe? But I work long hours, so that could just be from that. I wouldn’t say it’s constant. And the tiredness… well, that's why I came in the first place, right? Is the achiness related, do you think? Because honestly, I’m starting to feel like I’m wasting your time if it's just… normal aches.
DOCTOR: No, you're not wasting my time at all. And it’s good you mention the aches. Where exactly are you feeling them?
PATIENT: Mostly in my hips and lower back. And sometimes my shoulders, but that’s usually after a really long day. It's not sharp pain, more like… a dull ache, you know? Like I’ve been doing too much. I lift a lot at work, organizing things, so it could just be that. But it is pretty consistent, even on days I’m not doing much lifting. Maybe that’s the worrying part?
DOCTOR: Okay, hips, lower back, sometimes shoulders... consistent even with rest. Right. Hmm. Given the elevated ESR and your symptoms, I think it would be prudent to order some further testing. Just to rule out anything more serious. We could do some imaging—an X-ray of your hips and lower back would be a good start. And perhaps some bloodwork to check for rheumatoid factors and other inflammatory markers. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Imaging and more bloodwork… Honestly, Dr. Galena, I’m not thrilled about more tests. It’s expensive, and I don’t even have insurance. But… if you think it’s necessary, I guess. I just want to know what’s wrong, or if there is anything wrong. So, yeah. Okay, let’s do the tests. But can we talk about cost beforehand?
DOCTOR: Absolutely. You’re right to ask. I understand the financial burden, and we’ll do our best to work with you. Let me see… the X-rays should be relatively inexpensive, around \$150, maybe a little more depending on the clinic. The additional bloodwork… probably around \$200. We can discuss payment options and potentially look into some patient assistance programs. I'll also have my staff check if there are any lower-cost imaging facilities in the area. Okay, I'll write up the orders now. And we'll schedule those for you. Is there anything else you're experiencing—anything at all—that we haven't discussed?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers it. Just… please let me know as soon as you have the results, okay? I’m really trying to keep my schedule clear in case I need to come back. And thank you for being understanding about the cost. It really helps. .
DOCTOR: Of course, Kahrin. We will absolutely contact you as soon as the results are in. My staff will also be in touch to discuss scheduling and payment options. And you're very welcome. We’ll figure this out. It was nice meeting you. Have a good day.
