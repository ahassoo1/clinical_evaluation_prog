DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Grumman. I am Dr. Jules. Now, let's not waste any time. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. My wife, she tell me to come. I… feel tired, always tired. Like no energy. She say my liver, it not good. I don’t feel sick sick, just… slow. Everything take effort now.
DOCTOR: Tired, you say. And your wife believes it's a liver issue. Hmm. While I appreciate your wife’s concern, we don't rely on assumptions, Mr. Grumman. “Slow,” you say… can you elaborate on that?
PATIENT: Elaborate? What you mean? Just… getting out of chair hard. Walking to store, need rest. Before, I walk all day, no problem. Now… maybe half way, I need sit. It is… annoying. Very annoying. Not like old man tiredness, you understand? It different.
DOCTOR: “Different” is… helpful. Though still imprecise, unfortunately. So, this fatigue and decreased stamina… how long has this been going on?
PATIENT: Maybe… six months? Seven? I not good with time. It start slow, I think. Wife notice first. She always notice. She say I not help with garden like before. I say, “I busy!” But… she right, I guess. It get worse, little by little. Now, even fixing fence, too much.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, let's see what the records say… And you say this has been progressing gradually over six to seven months. Any other symptoms accompany this fatigue, Mr. Grumman?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Like… when you have cold? No fever, no cough. Maybe… sometimes belly feel… full. Even if I not eat much. And… skin, it feel itchy sometimes. Not all over, just… arms, legs. Not always. It come and go. Is that a symptom? I don't know these things, Doctor. You are the one who knows.
DOCTOR: Fullness even with limited intake, and intermittent itching… yes, those could be relevant. Do you have any changes in your bowel habits, Mr. Grumman?
PATIENT: Bowel… habits? You mean… going to toilet? It… normal, I think. Maybe a little… lighter color. Wife say so. She watch everything. I not pay attention to these things. Is lighter color bad? I eat normal, I think. Not much different. Sometimes I eat injera, sometimes I eat… other food. What does color mean, Doctor? You making me worry now.
DOCTOR: Lighter stool color can indicate a few things, yes. It's not immediately alarming, but it’s something we need to investigate. Now, let's move on. Any history of jaundice – yellowing of the skin or eyes – either recently or in the past?
PATIENT: Jaundice? Yellow skin? No. I look like… me. Always brown skin. My wife would tell me if I turn yellow. She notice everything. I never been yellow. Never. You think I have some sickness? Is bad sickness? She said liver, but… I feel okay, mostly. Just… tired. It is not like I cannot walk, you understand? I just… don’t want to.
DOCTOR: Mr. Grumman, I understand you're feeling frustrated. However, "feeling okay" and having a medical issue are not mutually exclusive. Let’s proceed with a physical examination, shall we?
PATIENT: Fine. Examine. Do what you need. But do not poke too hard. My bones not so strong anymore. And I have things to do, you know. Garden need weeding, fence need fixing… I not have all day for poking and prodding.
DOCTOR: Very well. Please lie back on the examination table. We'll start with listening to your heart and lungs. Then I'll palpate your abdomen. And yes, I will be gentle. Take a deep breath… and exhale.
PATIENT: sighs loudly I am breathing, Doctor. Always breathing. Is good lungs. I work outside, fresh air. No city smoke. Better than most people, I think. You find something wrong, you tell me. Do not waste my time with nothing. takes a deep, exaggerated breath There. Happy now?
DOCTOR: Your lungs are clear, Mr. Grumman. As for your abdomen… it’s slightly tender in the upper right quadrant. Not acutely painful, but noticeable. No masses palpable at this time. Now, I’d like to order some blood work. Liver function tests, a complete blood count, and a metabolic panel. We need to see what's happening internally.
PATIENT: Blood work? More poking? I hate needles. Can't you just… know what is wrong? My wife, she says everything is too many tests. She say doctors just want money. But you… you seem serious. Still. Blood work. Fine. But quick, please. And do not use big needle. crosses arms and looks away Tell me what these tests are for. Liver function… what does that even mean?
DOCTOR: "Liver function tests" measure the enzymes and proteins in your blood to assess the health of your liver. It's a simple blood draw, Mr. Grumman. And no, it won't take all day. The other tests will give us a general overview of your health. I understand your wife’s concerns, but we need objective data, not just assumptions. I’ll have the nurse draw the blood now. It’s standard procedure. The results should be back in a few days. We’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have other patients waiting.
PATIENT: Fine. Tests. Follow-up. muttering under breath Always tests… waste of time… looks at the pamphlet briefly, then shrugs and puts it back down I will go sit. And try not to fall asleep before the nurse comes. slowly gets up from the examination table, looking annoyed Don't bother calling if results are normal. My wife will know anyway. .
