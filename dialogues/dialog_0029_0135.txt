DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Radillo. I’m Dr. Chora. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. I have… problem with my ear. It is leaking something. A liquid. It started, maybe… one week ago? It is not painful, but it is… bothersome.
DOCTOR: Okay, a week ago you noticed some discharge from your ear. Not painful, just bothersome. Can you describe the liquid?
PATIENT: Yes, one week. It is… clear. Like water, mostly. Sometimes a little bit… yellow. Not much, though. Very small amount. It drains when I… lie down, I think. Mostly when I sleep. It makes my pillow a little damp.
DOCTOR: Alright, clear or slightly yellow discharge, more noticeable when you lie down, especially while sleeping. Have you noticed any changes in your hearing?
PATIENT: Yes. That is… good you ask. My hearing… it is not as sharp. Like… muffled. Especially in that ear. Not much, but I must ask my wife to repeat things sometimes. She says I do not listen, but I think it is my ear.
DOCTOR: Okay, so some muffled hearing in the same ear as the discharge. Have you had any pain, fever, or dizziness along with this?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No pain at all. No fever. And I… do not feel dizzy. I walk normally. Everything… feels steady. Just the hearing. And the liquid. It is… a little worrying, yes?
DOCTOR: Alright, no pain, fever, or dizziness. Just the discharge and muffled hearing. Have you ever had any problems with your ears before – infections, tubes, or anything like that?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think… when I was a boy, very small boy, in Somalia, I had… something. An ache, maybe. The doctor there gave me drops. But… that was very long ago. Many years. I have not had trouble since… until now. Nothing like tubes, no. I do not think so. It was just… drops. I was very young.
DOCTOR: Okay, a childhood ear issue treated with drops, but nothing since then. Do you have any allergies, or are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: No allergies, Doctor. I do not take any pills. Nothing. I drink my tea, and… sometimes I take a little vitamin D, because the weather is… not sunny enough here. But that is all. Just the tea and the vitamin D.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies and just tea and a vitamin D supplement. And just to confirm, you said this started about a week ago?
PATIENT: Yes, exactly one week, Doctor. August 1st, I noticed it when I woke up. My pillow felt… damp. And the ear felt… not normal. Not painful, but… different. Like something was… leaking. I did not think much of it at first. I hoped it would go away. But it has not. That is why I am here.
DOCTOR: Okay. Let's take a look at your ear. I’m going to gently examine your ear canal with this instrument. It won’t be painful, but let me know if it’s uncomfortable.
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Thank you. I am ready. Gently is good. I am a little… nervous, yes. But I trust you. Please, tell me if you see anything… concerning.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see some clear fluid in the ear canal, and the ear drum appears slightly cloudy. There's some redness around the ear canal opening as well. It looks like you have a mild external otitis, or swimmer's ear, potentially with some fluid buildup. It doesn't look severely infected at this point, but we need to address it. Now, I'm going to gently palpate around your ear and neck to check for any swelling. No swelling or tenderness.
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That is… good to know. No swelling, yes? Good. Swimmer’s ear, you say? I do not swim often, but I do shower, of course. What does this mean? What will we do about it? Is it… serious? Will I lose my hearing? I apologize for all the questions, but I am… anxious.
DOCTOR: It's alright, Mr. Radillo, those are all good questions. It's not uncommon to get an external ear infection even without swimming – sometimes showering can introduce moisture and bacteria into the ear canal. It’s usually not serious if we catch it early, which we have. It shouldn’t lead to hearing loss if we treat it properly. I'm going to prescribe you some antibiotic ear drops. You’ll need to clean the ear gently with a cotton swab—but only in the outer ear canal—and then instill the drops twice a day for seven days. It’s important to complete the full course, even if your symptoms improve. Do you have any difficulty with dexterity or vision that might make applying the drops difficult?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No difficulty. My hands are steady, and I can see very well. My wife, she can help, of course, if I need her, but I can do it myself. Seven days, you say? Twice a day. I will write it down. Antibiotic drops… and clean the outer ear only. And finish the whole course, even if it feels better. Is there anything else I should know? What if it does not get better? Or gets worse?
DOCTOR: Good. That’s excellent. Just be sure to avoid getting any water in your ear during this time. And keep the drops refrigerated, if the instructions indicate to do so. If it doesn’t improve after five days, or if you start experiencing more pain, fever, dizziness, or drainage that smells foul, contact the office immediately. That could indicate a more serious infection. Also, if the drops cause any irritation or rash, stop using them and let us know. I'll write out the prescription and instructions for you. And, to be safe, I’m going to schedule a follow-up appointment for one week from today just to check your progress. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… very good. Five days if it does not improve. Foul smell, irritation, rash… I will watch for those things. Write everything down, yes? And a follow-up appointment in one week. I appreciate you being so thorough. I feel much better knowing what to do. Thank you.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Radillo. I’m glad I could reassure you. Here's the prescription and these detailed instructions. Don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns at all. The nurse will schedule your follow-up before you leave. Have a good day, and I hope you feel better soon. .
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. I will follow your instructions carefully. And thank you again for your time. . .
