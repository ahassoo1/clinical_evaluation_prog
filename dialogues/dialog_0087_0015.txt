DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Boham. My name is Dr. Soodeen. It's a pleasure to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. It is nice to meet you as well. Hmm… what brings me in… oh! Yes. My sinuses. They… they been bothering me. A lot of pressure, you know? It feels… full. Like something is stuck.
DOCTOR: Okay, sinus pressure. And how long have you been experiencing this fullness, Ms. Boham?
PATIENT: Oh… that is a good question. A while, I think. Maybe… a couple of weeks? It comes and goes, but it's been more often lately. I don’t remember exactly. Things… slip my mind these days, you know? I’m sorry. Is a couple of weeks… okay?
DOCTOR: It's perfectly alright, Ms. Boham. It’s common for it to be difficult to pinpoint exact dates. “A couple of weeks” is helpful. Has anything specific seemed to trigger the pressure, or make it worse?
PATIENT: Hmm… trigger it… I work outside, you know? With the… the drill. Big machines. Lots of dust. Maybe that? And sometimes… the weather. When it gets very cold, or very hot. But I don't know if that is it. It just feels… worse then. It’s hard to say. Is that… helpful?
DOCTOR: That is very helpful, Ms. Boham. Working outdoors with dust exposure and changes in weather – those are definitely things that can contribute to sinus issues. Do you have any other symptoms along with the pressure?
PATIENT: Oh… symptoms. Let me think. Sometimes… my head hurts. Not a bad hurt, just… a dull ache. And… sometimes I feel tired. Very tired. But I work hard, you know? So maybe that is why. And… Oh! And I have a little trouble… smelling things. Not everything, but… some things. Like flowers. My husband brings me flowers, but… I don’t smell them very much anymore.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a dull headache, fatigue, and some decreased sense of smell. Have you noticed any fever, nasal discharge – meaning a runny or stuffy nose – or sore throat?
PATIENT: Fever… no, I don’t think so. I don’t feel feverish. And… My nose… it sometimes feels stuffy. Not always, but… when the pressure is bad. It’s hard to breathe through it, you know? Not a lot of running, though. Mostly just… stuffy. And no, no sore throat. My throat feels fine. Is that… good or bad? I don’t know what is good and bad.
DOCTOR: It’s neither good nor bad, Ms. Boham, just information that helps me understand what’s going on. Okay, so sinus pressure, dull headache, fatigue, decreased smell, and occasional nasal stuffiness. Have you ever had this happen before?
PATIENT: Oh… before? Hmm… I think… maybe. A long time ago. When I was younger. But it wasn’t… this bad. I don’t really remember. Things… fade. Sorry. Was that helpful? It’s hard for me to recall. It was a long time ago. I don’t remember if I went to a doctor for it then.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Ms. Boham. It's not always easy to remember things from the past. We’ll focus on what’s happening now. Let’s talk about your medical history. Do you have any medical conditions – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, asthma – that you've been diagnosed with?
PATIENT: Oh… medical conditions… No, Doctor. I don't think so. I have never been told I have anything like that. I work hard, you know? I have always been strong. I do feel… tired lately, but I thought that was just… from the work. Is that… bad? Should I be worried? My husband always tells me to be careful, but I feel okay. Mostly.
DOCTOR: It's good to hear you’ve generally been healthy, Ms. Boham. Feeling tired isn't necessarily a sign of something serious, but it's good to investigate, which is why we're talking today. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Oh… surgeries… No, Doctor. Never. I’ve been lucky, I think. I broke my arm when I was a little girl, climbing a tree… but they just… put it in a cast. It wasn't a surgery. Just a cast. Nothing else. I've never been in the hospital. I try to be careful, you know? Working with the machines… it can be dangerous. But I am careful. Mostly.
DOCTOR: Okay, no surgeries or hospitalizations. Now, let's talk about your family. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, cancer, diabetes, or allergies – that you’re aware of?
PATIENT: Oh… family… My mother… she had… problems with her heart. When she was older. She was sick for a long time. And my father… he had trouble with his… lungs. He smoked a lot. He died when I was young. And my husband's mother… she had… allergies. Always sneezing. But that is all I really know. Things weren’t talked about much when I was growing up. Is that… helpful? I don’t know much about family history.
DOCTOR: That's very helpful, Ms. Boham. Knowing about your mother’s heart condition and your father’s lung issues is important, and allergies are good to know as well. Finally, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh… allergies… No, Doctor. I don't think so. I've never had a reaction to anything. I eat everything. I haven't tried anything strange… mostly just beans and rice, and the food my husband makes. He is a good cook. I haven’t ever had to worry about allergies. I think. I've never had to take much medicine, so I don’t know. Is that… alright? I don't want to forget something important.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Boham. You've given me a lot of helpful information. Now, I'd like to do a brief physical exam, if you’re comfortable with that. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your sinuses for tenderness, and take a look in your nose and throat. Will that be okay?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… good. Whatever you need to do. I trust you. Just… be gentle, please? My head… sometimes hurts, you know? But I want to find out what is wrong. Yes, go ahead. I’ll do whatever you need me to. Thank you for… listening. It helps to talk about it.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Boham. I will be as gentle as possible. First, let’s listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath in… and out… again… good. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs noted. Lung sounds are clear, but with some slight diminished breath sounds bilaterally. Now, let’s check your sinuses. I’m going to gently press on your forehead and around your cheekbones. Does this cause any pain?
PATIENT: Okay… Ooh… yes. Here… It hurts a little. And… here. Not a bad pain, but… a pressure. A dull ache. Like something is… full. Is that… what you were looking for? It’s better when you don't press, though. It’s… uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s helpful, Ms. Boham. Tenderness to palpation over the frontal and maxillary sinuses. Now, I'd like to take a quick look at your nose and throat. I'll use a light. This may be slightly uncomfortable, but it shouldn't hurt. Please open your mouth and say "Ah." Throat appears mildly erythematous, meaning slightly red, but no obvious signs of infection. Nasal passages appear somewhat congested, with some clear mucus present. No significant polyps or structural abnormalities noted.
PATIENT: Okay… Ah… Is it… bad? I don’t see much myself, you know. My vision isn't what it used to be. Is my throat very red? Am I sick? It feels… dry. And my nose… is it very stuffed up? I can feel the pressure, but I don't know what it looks like. What do you think, Doctor?
DOCTOR: No, it’s not bad, Ms. Boham. Your throat is mildly red, but that's not necessarily a sign of a serious infection. It could be from dryness or irritation. And yes, your nasal passages are congested, as you've noticed, which is consistent with sinus pressure. Based on what you’ve told me and my exam findings, it sounds like you're likely experiencing sinusitis – inflammation of your sinuses, probably due to a viral upper respiratory infection, or possibly allergies given your exposure and symptoms. The diminished breath sounds are something to monitor as well. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: Sinusitis… that sounds… serious. Is it… bad? Do I need… shots? Or medicine? I don’t want to be very sick. And allergies… I don’t know anything about allergies. Is that why my nose feels stuffed? Will it go away? Is it something I caught? From… outside? My husband will be so worried if I get sick.
DOCTOR: It's understandable to be worried, Ms. Boham. Sinusitis can be uncomfortable, but it’s usually not serious. Most cases are caused by viruses, like a common cold, and resolve on their own with supportive care. Shots are typically not needed unless we suspect a bacterial infection, which doesn't seem likely at this time. The stuffed nose can definitely be from either the viral infection or allergies, or even a combination of both. It is possible you caught something from outside, but it’s also common for these things to occur without a specific cause. For now, I recommend the following: plenty of fluids, rest, and over-the-counter pain relievers like acetaminophen or ibuprofen for the headache. A saline nasal spray can also help to relieve the congestion. We can also discuss an over-the-counter antihistamine to see if that helps with the allergy-like symptoms. I’d like you to return in one week if your symptoms haven’t improved or if they worsen. We can then consider other options, such as a prescription medication. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Okay… fluids, rest, and… the spray. I think I can do that. Saline spray… I’ve heard of that. And the pain reliever… I have some at home, I think. One week… yes. If it doesn’t get better. Antihistamine… is that for the allergies? Will it help with the stuffed nose? It’s just… so uncomfortable. I don’t like feeling like I can’t breathe. But one week… yes. I can try that. Thank you, Doctor. You have been very helpful. And… kind. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Boham. An antihistamine can help with the allergy symptoms, which may contribute to the stuffed nose. If it’s primarily from the virus, it may not help much, but it’s worth a try. I’m glad I could help. Remember to prioritize rest and fluids. If you develop a high fever, severe headache, facial pain, or changes in vision, please seek medical attention immediately. Here's a printed handout with more information on sinusitis and the recommendations we discussed. Please don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions. Have a good day, Ms. Boham, and please take care of yourself.
