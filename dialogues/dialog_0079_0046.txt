DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Creagh. I am Dr. GonzalezPerez. It's a pleasure to meet you. Now, could you please tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. I’ve been experiencing some…pressure in my bladder, and it’s been bothering me for a little while now. It’s difficult to explain, but it feels like I need to go constantly, even when I don’t.
DOCTOR: I see. Pressure, and a frequent urge to urinate…Right. And how long precisely has this "little while" been?
PATIENT: Let me think… it started, I believe, sometime in late May, perhaps the first week. So, about two months now, give or take a few days. I kept hoping it would resolve on its own, but it hasn’t.
DOCTOR: Two months. And has anything, to your knowledge, changed around that time?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. Let me consider. Around late May… my daughter started summer camp, which meant a bit more rushing around in the mornings, but I don’t think that would directly cause this. My husband and I did start a new exercise class – a Zumba class, actually – but that began a bit later, maybe mid-June. No major dietary changes, though. I'm trying to recall anything else...
DOCTOR: Zumba, you say. Interesting. And would you describe this pressure as painful, or simply… uncomfortable?
PATIENT: It's not painful, Doctor. Definitely uncomfortable. More like a fullness, a constant urging, and sometimes a bit of… a burning sensation, but very mild. It's not sharp, it's just… present. It’s more bothersome than anything, honestly, interrupting my work and making it difficult to concentrate.
DOCTOR: Right. Intermittent burning…mild, you say. And when you urinate, do you feel like you completely empty your bladder, or do you still feel the need to go shortly afterwards?
PATIENT: That's a good question. Usually, no. I don't feel like I empty it completely. Even after going, there's still a feeling like there's some left. That contributes to the constant urgency, I think. It’s quite frustrating.
DOCTOR: Alright. We should rule out a simple urinary tract infection, just to be safe. I'd like to perform a quick urinalysis. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, that sounds perfectly reasonable. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I want to get to the bottom of this. I’m happy to provide a sample. Where would you like me to go?
DOCTOR: Excellent. The restroom is just down the hall to your left. There's a sterile collection cup inside. Please try to provide a mid-stream sample—that is, start urinating, then collect a portion mid-flow. Once you have that, you can leave it on the counter in the restroom, and I will collect it. Do you have any questions about that process?
PATIENT: No, that sounds clear enough. Start, then mid-stream… I think I understand. A mid-stream sample. Thank you for explaining that, Doctor. I’ll go do that now.
DOCTOR: Very good. Take your time, Ms. Creagh. I’ll be right here when you’re finished.
PATIENT: I've left the sample in the restroom, Doctor. It was a bit awkward trying to remember all that mid-stream business, but I believe I did it correctly.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Creagh. I'll just step into the lab and perform the analysis. It should only take a few moments. Alright, the results are back. The urinalysis shows a presence of leukocytes and nitrites, indicating a likely urinary tract infection. It’s not severe at this point, but left untreated, it could become more problematic. Do you have any known allergies to antibiotics?
PATIENT: Oh, that explains the burning sensation, doesn't it? No, I don’t have any known allergies to antibiotics, Doctor. Thankfully. I haven't taken any in… well, probably over ten years. What would you recommend? Is it something I need to worry about urgently?
DOCTOR: No, it is not an emergency situation, but it's best to address it promptly. I am going to prescribe you a seven-day course of Nitrofurantoin, a common antibiotic for UTIs. It's generally well-tolerated. It’s crucial to finish the entire course, even if you begin to feel better before it's completed, to ensure the infection is fully eradicated. Now, do you have any history of kidney problems or liver disease?
PATIENT: No, I don’t have any history of kidney or liver problems. My family doctor always said my labs came back perfectly normal. I am generally quite healthy. Seven days of antibiotics… that sounds good. Is there anything specific I should watch out for while taking it? Any side effects I need to be aware of? I like to be prepared.
DOCTOR: Very good. The most common side effects are nausea, loss of appetite, and abdominal discomfort. It can also, rarely, cause changes in urine color – it may become darker. More serious, though rare, side effects include allergic reactions or lung inflammation. Should you experience a rash, difficulty breathing, or any unusual chest pain, discontinue the medication immediately and seek medical attention. I’ve included a detailed information sheet with the prescription that outlines all potential side effects. Also, it's important to drink plenty of fluids while on antibiotics—at least eight glasses of water per day. Are you currently taking any other medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Thank you for the detailed information, Doctor. I appreciate that. No, I'm not currently taking any other medications or supplements. Just a daily multivitamin, but that's it. And plenty of water – absolutely. That sounds manageable. I think I have all the information I need. Should I schedule a follow-up appointment, or will you want me to call if the symptoms don’t improve after the seven days?
DOCTOR: Good. A daily multivitamin shouldn’t interact with the Nitrofurantoin. Let's do this: if your symptoms have not significantly improved after completing the seven-day course, or if they worsen at any point, please call the office to schedule a follow-up appointment. We may need to run further tests to rule out other potential issues. Otherwise, there is no need for a routine follow-up. And remember, finish the entire course of antibiotics! Do you have any other questions for me today, Ms. Creagh?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything, Doctor. Thank you so much for your time and explanation. I feel much better knowing what’s going on and how to address it. Have a good day. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Creagh. I am glad I could help. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if any concerns arise. Have a good day as well, and I hope you feel better soon. Goodbye. .
