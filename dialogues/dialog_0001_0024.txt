DOCTOR: Right. Kiante Sayar, 33 years old. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, thank you, Doctor Pehrson. It’s…a bit of a strange request, actually. I need a letter saying I’m able to fly. My husband…passed away last year, and we had a trip planned to visit family in Mongolia. I finally decided I want to go, but the airline needs a doctor’s note confirming I’m healthy enough for a long flight.
DOCTOR: A letter saying you're able to fly…right. Okay. And this is…because of grief?
PATIENT: Not exactly. It’s…well, after he passed, I was pretty sick for a while. Just…exhausted, a lot of infections. I’m much better now, really. But the airline wants to be sure nothing will…flare up at thirty thousand feet, I guess. They didn’t say why specifically, just that they need the letter.
DOCTOR: Exhausted and infections… Okay. Any specific infections?
PATIENT: Um… let me think. I had a really bad sinus infection in the spring, and then a chest infection right after that. Nothing…major, I don’t think. I was mostly just run down. I saw a different doctor then, Dr. Ramirez. I don’t remember the specifics, honestly, it was a stressful time. I just want to make sure this trip doesn't cause any problems.
DOCTOR: "Stressful time" doesn't really tell me much. Alright. Any allergies?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. I eat everything, really. And I haven’t been taking any medications since…well, since everything settled down with the infections, about six months ago.
DOCTOR: Six months… okay. And you said you’re much better now?
PATIENT: Yes, much better. I’m working full-time – advertising sales, it keeps me busy. I’m sleeping normally, eating well, and I haven’t been sick at all in the last few months. Honestly, Doctor, I feel healthier than I have in years. It’s just…the airline being cautious, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Advertising sales... Alright, let's just do a quick listen to your lungs and heart, just to be thorough. It’s probably nothing, but I need to cover my bases. Sit back.
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds good. I understand.
DOCTOR: Okay. Lungs are clear, heart sounds regular. Blood pressure’s 120 over 80, pulse is 72. Seems…fine. Do you have any…family history of blood clots or anything?
PATIENT: No, not that I’m aware of. My parents are both still alive and healthy, and I don’t really know much about my grandparents’ medical history. We didn't talk about that sort of thing much.
DOCTOR: Okay. Well, frankly, this seems like a waste of my time. But, fine. I’ll write a note saying you’re cleared for travel. Just…don’t come back complaining if something happens.
PATIENT: Okay, thank you, Doctor. I appreciate it. I understand you're busy, and I really didn't want to take up too much of your time. I’ll be sure to be careful.
DOCTOR: Here. There. Now, is there anything else?
PATIENT: No, that’s everything. Thank you again, Doctor. I appreciate you writing it.
DOCTOR: Right. Get well, and try not to worry so much. .
PATIENT: Okay. Thank you. .
