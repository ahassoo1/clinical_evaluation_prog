DOCTOR: Hi Gedalya, good to meet you. I'm Dr. DeCosta. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good day, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s a bit difficult to explain. I’ve been feeling weaker, generally. And my eyelids… they feel heavy, and they’re drooping. It’s been getting worse over the last few months, I’d say.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Weakness and drooping eyelids that have been worsening over a few months. That is something we should look into. To get a better picture, could you tell me a little more about the weakness?
PATIENT: Certainly. It started in my arms, I think. Lifting things felt… harder. Now it’s in my legs too. Walking longer distances tires me out much faster than it used to. It's not a sudden thing, more of a gradual… fading, if that makes sense. It’s not painful, just… less strength.
DOCTOR: It does make sense – a gradual fading of strength. And it’s good to know it’s not painful. So, it started in your arms and has progressed to your legs, making walking more tiring. Have you noticed this weakness being worse at certain times of the day, or after particular activities?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. I don’t think so, not specifically. It seems pretty consistent, to be honest. Maybe slightly worse towards the end of the day, but that could just be general tiredness, you know? I work a fair bit on my feet, checking the buildings and such. It’s hard to tell.
DOCTOR: I understand – it can be tough to separate out general fatigue from the weakness itself, especially with a physically demanding job. Checking buildings… are you a building inspector, or something similar?
PATIENT: Not an inspector, no. I’m a facilities manager. I oversee the upkeep of several properties – making sure everything is running smoothly, repairs, that sort of thing. A lot of walking between locations, a bit of light lifting… the usual. It’s mostly administrative work, but it requires being present at the sites.
DOCTOR: Okay, facilities manager – that gives me a better understanding of your activity level. So, consistent weakness, not necessarily worse at specific times, and progressing over months. Now, thinking beyond the weakness, have you noticed any other symptoms at all?
PATIENT: Let me think… well, I’ve been a bit more tired than usual, even when I’ve had enough sleep. And… this might sound strange, but my vision seems a bit blurry sometimes. Just occasionally, though. It doesn’t last long. I thought it was just needing new glasses, to be honest. I haven’t actually been to get them checked.
DOCTOR: Blurry vision and increased fatigue… okay. It’s good you’re mentioning these things, even if they seem minor. It's definitely worth looking into the vision. Have you noticed any changes in your weight, either gaining or losing?
PATIENT: I… haven't really been tracking it, if that's what you mean. I think I might have lost a little bit, but it’s not significant. Probably just from the stress of things, to be honest. My divorce was finalized about six months ago, so things have been a bit unsettled. I haven’t been eating as regularly, perhaps.
DOCTOR: I see. A lot going on with the divorce… that absolutely can affect appetite and weight. And stress can certainly contribute to fatigue. Just to be thorough, have you noticed any difficulties with breathing, or any changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: No, no difficulties with breathing at all. And my… bowel habits have been normal, yes. Nothing out of the ordinary there. I apologize for being so… detailed. I’m not used to talking about these things.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all, Gedalya. It's good you're being detailed. It helps me get a complete picture. And it's perfectly normal to feel a little awkward talking about these things. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Not that I'm aware of, no. I’ve always been fairly healthy, to be honest. I had the usual childhood illnesses, measles, chickenpox, that sort of thing, but nothing serious. I haven’t been hospitalized for anything. I haven’t had any major surgeries. I see a dentist regularly, of course.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. No major medical history. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of. I can eat pretty much anything. I haven’t had any reactions to any medications in the past, as far as I recall. I haven’t needed to take much medication, thankfully. Just the occasional painkiller for a headache, that sort of thing.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. And you haven't been taking any regular medications. Now, just to complete the picture, can you tell me a little about your family history?
PATIENT: My… family history. Hmm. My mother had high blood pressure, I believe. And my father… he had some heart problems later in life, but I don’t know the specifics. It was a long time ago. I don't really know much beyond that, to be honest. We weren't very close. I don't recall any other significant illnesses in the family. It's not something we discussed much.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful to know. History of high blood pressure in your mother and heart problems in your father. Now, before we move on to a physical exam, let’s quickly talk about your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, I don’t smoke. I used to drink… occasionally, socially. But I haven’t had a drink in about a year, maybe a bit longer. Not since… well, not since the divorce. And I definitely don’t use any recreational drugs. Never have.
DOCTOR: Okay, no smoking, minimal alcohol use, and no recreational drugs. That’s good to know. Alright, Gedalya, thank you for sharing all of that information with me. It gives me a good starting point. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I’ll start by checking your vital signs – blood pressure, pulse, temperature – and then I’d like to take a look in your ears, nose, and throat. And I’ll also do a neurological exam to assess your strength and reflexes. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s perfectly alright, Doctor. Please proceed. I understand it’s necessary. I’ll do my best to cooperate. Though, I must admit, I'm a bit anxious about this whole thing. It’s just… unsettling, not knowing what’s going on.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Gedalya. It’s perfectly normal to feel anxious when you're not sure what's happening. We’ll take it one step at a time. I’ll explain everything as we go. Okay, your blood pressure is a little elevated, but nothing alarming at this point. Your pulse and temperature are normal. Okay, I’ve completed the exam. I did notice some mild weakness in your arms and legs, and your reflexes are slightly diminished. Your eye movements seem normal, and I didn’t observe any other concerning neurological signs. I’m also noting the drooping eyelids you mentioned. Based on what you’ve told me and what I’ve found during the exam, I'm considering a few possibilities. It could be something relatively benign, like a vitamin deficiency. But given the weakness, drooping eyelids, and slightly diminished reflexes, I'm also concerned about the possibility of a neurological condition called Myasthenia Gravis. It’s a condition that affects the communication between your nerves and muscles. However, we need to do some further testing to confirm or rule out this possibility. I’m going to order some blood tests, including a test for acetylcholine receptor antibodies, which can help diagnose Myasthenia Gravis. I also want to order an electromyography, or EMG, which measures the electrical activity of your muscles. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: Myasthenia… Gravis? That sounds… serious. I confess, I’ve never heard of it. And… tests, of course, are necessary. But it’s… unsettling to hear that something serious is even being considered. If you think it’s necessary, then yes, please proceed with the tests. Just… could you perhaps explain a little more about this Myasthenia Gravis? What are the… implications? What sort of treatment would be involved, if… if it is that? I’d like to understand what I’m potentially facing. And, if I may ask… how common is this condition?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Gedalya. It’s completely understandable that you’re feeling unsettled. Let’s talk about Myasthenia Gravis. It’s an autoimmune disorder, meaning your immune system mistakenly attacks healthy tissue – in this case, the connections between your nerves and muscles. This causes muscle weakness and fatigue. It often affects the muscles that control eye movement, facial expression, chewing, and swallowing, which explains the drooping eyelids and potential difficulty with those functions. It’s not contagious, and it’s relatively rare, affecting about 1 in every 3,000 people. The severity can vary quite a bit – some people have mild symptoms that don’t significantly interfere with their daily lives, while others experience more severe weakness that requires treatment. Treatment typically involves medications to suppress the immune system and improve communication between your nerves and muscles. There are several effective medications available, and many people with Myasthenia Gravis can live full and active lives with proper treatment. In some cases, surgery to remove the thymus gland may also be recommended. It’s important to remember that we don’t have a diagnosis yet. These are just possibilities. The blood tests and EMG will help us determine the cause of your symptoms. We'll go through the results together and discuss the best course of action, whatever that may be. I’ll write up the orders for the blood tests and EMG now, and I’ll give you a referral to a neurologist who specializes in neuromuscular disorders. They will be able to interpret the results and provide specialized care. Do you have any questions about that, or anything else at this point?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. That… that’s a lot of information. It’s still rather frightening, to be honest. But I appreciate you explaining it so clearly. A neurologist… yes, that sounds sensible. And the tests… I’ll schedule them as soon as possible. Just… how long will it take to get the results? And… is this condition… hereditary? Should my family be aware of this? I don’t have much contact with them, but… it might be prudent to inform them, if it’s something they need to be concerned about. Also, is there anything I should be doing now, while I’m waiting for the results? Any specific things I should avoid, or precautions I should take?
DOCTOR: Those are all very good questions, Gedalya. It’s perfectly natural to want to know what to expect and how to prepare. The blood test results typically take about 5-7 business days to come back. The EMG can take a little longer, maybe a week or so after the appointment. I'll make sure the lab and neurology office understand the urgency, and I'll follow up with you if there are any delays. Myasthenia Gravis is rarely directly inherited, but there can be a genetic predisposition in some cases. So, while it's not essential to inform your family immediately, it might be worthwhile to let them know, especially if they start experiencing similar symptoms. It's unlikely they'll develop the condition, but it's always better to be informed. While we're waiting for the results, there are a few things you can do. Try to avoid strenuous activities that worsen your weakness. Get plenty of rest, and eat a healthy diet. Avoid medications that can interfere with nerve and muscle function – I’ll give you a list of those to avoid. It's also important to pay attention to your symptoms and let me know if they worsen. This list includes medications to avoid, as well as some resources about Myasthenia Gravis. I also want to schedule a follow-up appointment for about two weeks from now, to discuss the results and plan our next steps. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Two weeks… yes, that sounds sensible. I appreciate the list, and the information. It’s… reassuring to have something concrete to refer to. I believe that covers all my questions for now, Doctor. Thank you for your patience and your thoroughness. It’s… a great deal to process, but I feel somewhat better equipped to face it, thanks to you. I will schedule the tests and the follow-up appointment as soon as possible. If, however, I do think of anything else, may I contact the clinic? .
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Gedalya. Please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any questions or concerns, no matter how small they may seem. We’re here to support you. I wish you all the best, and I look forward to seeing you at your follow-up appointment. Take care.
