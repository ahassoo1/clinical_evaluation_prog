DOCTOR: Right, yes. Cleo Rover, 47... Private insurance. Look, I'm a bit swamped today, so let’s get straight to it. What brings you in here?
PATIENT: Well, hello. It’s… about long-term care, I think? My wife, she… she took care of all that stuff. Before. It’s been a little while, and I just… need to make sure everything is still okay, you know? For the future. I don't really remember all the details, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Long-term care… vague recollection, naturally. Okay. So, you’re concerned about future planning. And your wife… handled everything previously. Right. Is this about… a will?
PATIENT: A will? Hmm… maybe? She did a lot of paperwork. I mostly just… did the work she told me to do. Lifting things, moving stuff. I don't think she talked about a will specifically. It was more about… if I needed help someday, I guess. Like, if I couldn’t take care of myself. Does that make sense? I'm not good with… words, sometimes.
DOCTOR: Right, right. So, you mean… advanced directives?
PATIENT: Advanced… what now? Is that… like a plan? For when you get old? Or sick? I really don't know these names. She just said I needed to get this checked, for the insurance. Something about making sure I was… covered. It's all a bit fuzzy.
DOCTOR: Of course. Look, let's see… advanced directives, power of attorney, healthcare proxy… all the usual. It's just paperwork, really. Did she ever mention anything about where these documents are?
PATIENT: Paperwork… She had a special box. A wooden one, with a little latch. It was in the spare bedroom, on the top shelf of the closet. But… after she passed, things got… moved around. People helped. I don't really know where anything is now. I'm sorry. It's probably somewhere in the house, but… I couldn’t tell you for sure. It’s been a while.
DOCTOR: Right. So, lost documents. Wonderful. Well, look, realistically, without those documents, we can't do much here today. It’s all about legal authorization, you see. Let's just… run a basic physical. Rule out anything immediate. Blood pressure, heart rate… the usual. It won’t solve your long-term care issue, but it's something. Do you have any allergies?
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds… okay. Allergies? Not that I know of. Never really had a problem with anything. Food, medicine… Nope. Nothing comes to mind. I eat pretty much whatever. She always made sure I had enough to eat, though. Good cook, my wife.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, let's get this over with. Blood pressure first. Please sit here. And just… try to relax. It'll be faster if you cooperate.
PATIENT: Okay. Relax, right. I can do that. Just… a little nervous, I guess. Haven't been to a doctor in a long time. She always handled these things.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, don't worry about it. It's routine. 140 over 90. A little elevated, but not alarming. We’ll keep an eye on it. Heart rate is… 78. Regular. Lungs are clear. Any chest pain?
PATIENT: No, no chest pain. Not now, not ever really. I do get a little… winded sometimes, when I’m lifting heavy stuff. But that’s just from the work, I think. I’m a laborer, you know? Moving things around. It’s hard work. Always has been.
DOCTOR: Right, manual labor. Of course. Probably just your blood pressure then. Nothing to worry about. Any current medications?
PATIENT: Medications? Nope. Not really. She always told me to take a vitamin D supplement in the winter, but… I forget, to be honest. I don't really take anything regularly. Just whatever she gave me, when I needed it. Nothing now.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, based on this limited examination - blood pressure slightly elevated, but otherwise unremarkable - it seems you’re… generally okay. But the long-term care issue… we can’t address that without the proper documentation. I suggest you spend some time trying to locate those papers. Perhaps contact the people who helped you after your wife passed. It's vital. Do you have any questions for me?
PATIENT: No, I… I don't think so. Not right now. It’s just… a lot to take in. I guess I need to find those papers. Like you said. It’s just… hard, remembering everything. And she did everything. Thank you… for trying. I appreciate it.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, don’t hesitate to call if you uncover any information. And remember, proactive planning is crucial. Good day. .
PATIENT: Thank you. Good day to you too. .
