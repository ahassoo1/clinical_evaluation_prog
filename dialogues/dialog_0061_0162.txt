DOCTOR: Bula and welcome, Mr. Kristofik! I'm Dr. Kimm. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Look, can we just…get on with it? I got stuff to do. It’s my stomach. Been feeling all puffed up, like I swallowed a balloon. Honestly, it’s annoying.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand you’re busy and want to get straight to the point. No problem at all. “Puffed up,” you say… so your stomach feels distended and uncomfortable?
PATIENT: Distended? Look, I just said bloated, okay? It feels big. Like I ate too much, but I haven’t. It’s just…there. And it's been going on for a bit. Not sure how long, honestly. A week? Maybe more. Time kinda blends together these days.
DOCTOR: Alright, "bloated" is perfectly fine – no need to be formal with me! A week or more of feeling bloated... Okay. And is this bloating constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Comes and goes, I guess. It's worse after I eat, usually. Doesn't matter what I eat, though. Steak, salad, doesn't seem to make a difference. Which is…weird, right? I mean, usually something greasy would bother me. This is just…always there, kinda. Some days it's worse than others, but it never really goes away completely.
DOCTOR: That is a little unusual, that it doesn’t seem to be tied to specific foods. And you’re saying it’s been consistent for about a week or more?
PATIENT: Yeah, roughly. Look, I'm not a doctor, okay? I just know it's uncomfortable. It makes my clothes feel tight, and…honestly? It’s embarrassing. I don't like feeling like this. Is there anything you can do about it, or am I just stuck looking pregnant? Because that's how I feel.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, and I apologize if I'm asking a lot of questions. It's important for me to get a good picture of what's going on so I can help. You mentioned embarrassment…have you noticed any other symptoms along with the bloating?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Uh… not really. Maybe a little gas, but everyone has gas. And… I guess I’ve been a bit tired lately, but that’s just life, you know? Work is hard, and…well, things have been tough since my wife passed. So, yeah, tired. That's about it. Nothing else that stands out. Honestly, I just want this puffiness to stop.
DOCTOR: I'm very sorry to hear about your wife. That must be incredibly difficult. It's understandable that you’re feeling tired with everything you're going through. Okay, so bloating, some gas, and tiredness… No change in your bowel habits at all?
PATIENT: Bowel habits? Look, I go to the bathroom when I need to. Is that what you’re asking? No…nothing different. Regular, I guess. Solid. No…problems there. Just…the stomach. It's always the stomach. Can we please just figure out what's wrong with it? I don't have all day.
DOCTOR: Okay, no changes in bowel habits, that’s good to know. And you’re right, let’s focus on the stomach. Have you tried anything to relieve the bloating yourself?
PATIENT: Relieve it? Yeah, a little bit. I tried some of those…gas pills. Didn’t do much. And I tried drinking ginger ale, because my mother always said that helped. That did nothing either. I even tried… loosening my belt, which, honestly, shouldn't be necessary. So, no. Nothing works. It just…is. This is getting ridiculous.
DOCTOR: Alright. Gas pills and ginger ale didn't help. Okay. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright. I’ll listen to your stomach with my stethoscope and feel it gently. Just to see if there's anything obvious going on. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Fine. Just…be quick about it. I really don’t like being poked and prodded. And please, no unnecessary chatting. Just listen and…whatever. Get it over with.
DOCTOR: Okay, I'm listening now…and feeling around… Your abdomen is a bit distended, as you described. I don’t feel any tenderness or masses, and bowel sounds are present, though a bit…hypoactive, meaning a little quieter than usual. It doesn’t seem to be anything acutely concerning, but I'd like to order some blood work and a stool test just to rule out a few things. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Blood work and…stool tests? Seriously? Look, I just want a pill to make it stop puffing up, not spend the next week running around giving you samples. Is there anything else you can do? Anything at all? Because this is starting to feel like a waste of my time. I got work to do.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, and I apologize if this feels like a lot. The blood work will help us check for inflammation or any underlying medical conditions that could be contributing to the bloating. The stool test will help us rule out any infections or issues with your digestion. It’s just to be thorough and make sure we're not missing anything serious. But, before we do that, let’s try something simple. Given your history, and the fact that the bloating seems constant, I'm wondering if you might be experiencing some symptoms of Irritable Bowel Syndrome, or IBS. We can often manage that with dietary changes and some over-the-counter medications. Would you be willing to try a low-FODMAP diet for a couple of weeks?
PATIENT: Low…what diet? Look, I eat what I can, when I can. I don’t have time to be measuring every single thing I put in my mouth. Honestly, this is getting ridiculous. IBS? So you're telling me I’m just…sensitive? After all this? I work a hard job, I don't have time for "sensitivity." Just… forget it. I’ll just deal with it, okay? Waste of time and money. I'm leaving.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, and I respect your decision. I'm truly sorry we couldn't find a solution today. Here, this brochure outlines some general tips for managing bloating. Even if you don't want to try a full diet change, some of these suggestions might be helpful. If your symptoms worsen or you develop any new concerns, please don’t hesitate to come back and see me, or another doctor. It’s important to rule out anything serious, even if it’s just to have peace of mind. I wish you all the best, Mr. Kristofik.
