DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Creagh. I’m Dr. Hembrey. It says here you’re with Medicare. Thank you for choosing our practice. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Dr. Hembrey. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. I’m here because I’ve been having a lot of pressure on my bladder lately. It’s been… uncomfortable, to say the least.
DOCTOR: Uncomfortable, I see. Can you elaborate on that discomfort, Ms. Creagh?
PATIENT: Certainly. It's not necessarily painful, but it feels like I constantly need to go to the bathroom, even when I’ve just gone. And sometimes, when I do go, it doesn't feel like I empty it completely, you know? It's a very… persistent feeling.
DOCTOR: Persistent, yes. And how long has this been going on?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… it started, I’d say, about three weeks ago, maybe a little longer. It wasn’t too bad at first, just a little annoying. But it’s definitely gotten worse over the past week or so. I was hoping it would just go away on its own, but it hasn't.
DOCTOR: Three weeks… and worsening. Alright. Have you noticed any changes in your urine itself?
PATIENT: Hmm, that's a good question. I haven't specifically been looking, if that makes sense. But… now that you mention it, I think it might be a little darker than usual? And maybe a bit more… smelly? It's hard to say for sure. I don’t typically pay that close attention, honestly.
DOCTOR: I understand. Changes in color or odor can be indicative of several things. And have you experienced any fever, chills, or pain in your lower back or abdomen accompanying this?
PATIENT: No, thankfully no fever or chills. And no pain in my back or abdomen either. Just the constant pressure, and… well, the feeling of needing to go all the time. It’s mostly just uncomfortable, but it’s starting to disrupt my sleep, to be honest. I’m waking up several times a night.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Creagh. Let’s go through some basic questions. Do you have any known allergies – to medications, food, anything like that?
PATIENT: No, I don’t have any known allergies. I’ve been fortunate that way, thankfully. I can eat anything, and I haven’t had a reaction to any medications I’ve taken in the past. My husband always jokes I'm a boring patient in that regard.
DOCTOR: That is convenient. And are you currently taking any medications, prescription or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: Just a daily multivitamin, and occasionally ibuprofen for a headache, if I need it. But that’s it. I try to avoid taking too many pills if I can. I don’t have any chronic conditions that require regular medication, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Alright. Have you had any prior medical surgeries or hospitalizations?
PATIENT: Let me think… I had my tonsils removed when I was a child, that’s about it. And I broke my arm once when I was little, but that was just a simple fracture, nothing major. Otherwise, no surgeries or hospitalizations. I've been quite lucky in terms of health, really.
DOCTOR: And what about your family history?
PATIENT: That's a good question. My mother had diabetes, type 2, and my father had high blood pressure. He managed it with diet and medication for many years. As far as I know, there isn't any history of bladder problems or kidney issues in either family. It’s a pretty healthy family overall, really, but those are the main things I’m aware of.
DOCTOR: Okay. Now, I'd like to ask a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, I do not smoke. I used to drink a glass of wine with dinner occasionally, but I’ve cut back significantly. Maybe once a month now, if that. And I definitely do not use any recreational drugs. I lead a pretty quiet life, all things considered. Mostly work and spending time with my husband.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, Ms. Creagh, I’m going to need to perform a brief physical examination. I’ll need you to lie down on the examination table. I’ll need to palpate your abdomen and do a quick neurological exam, and then I’ll need a urine sample. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, that is perfectly acceptable, Dr. Hembrey. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. Please, let me know if there's anything specific I need to do. I'll lie down on the table now.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Please lie on your back with your knees bent and your feet flat on the table. I’ll start with listening to your abdomen, then palpating it. It may be slightly uncomfortable, just let me know if it is too much.
PATIENT: Alright. I’m ready when you are, Dr. Hembrey. And please, don't hesitate to ask me to stop if anything feels painful.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Creagh. Just breathe normally. Sounds within normal limits. Any tenderness here?
PATIENT: No, that’s not painful. Just… awareness of being touched, really. It’s not uncomfortable, just noticeable. Everything feels… normal to me, but then again, I'm not a doctor!
DOCTOR: No significant masses or tenderness noted. Bladder feels full, as expected given your symptoms. Okay, now I'm going to ask you to provide a urine sample. There’s a collection cup in the bathroom. Please try to collect a midstream sample if possible.
PATIENT: Okay, a midstream sample. I remember that from… well, I remember being told that before. I’ll go to the bathroom and collect that for you now. Please let me know if you need me to do anything else.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Creagh. Now, we’ll need to run a urinalysis to check for infection, blood, and other abnormalities. This will give us a better idea of what's going on. While we wait for those results, is there anything else you’d like to tell me, or any other symptoms you’ve been experiencing that we haven’t discussed?
PATIENT: No, I think we’ve covered everything, Dr. Hembrey. I really appreciate you being so thorough. It’s just… frustrating to feel this constant pressure, and to have to keep going to the bathroom. It’s starting to interfere with my work and my sleep, like I mentioned. I’m just hoping we can figure out what’s causing it.
DOCTOR: Alright. Given your symptoms and the duration, several possibilities come to mind. Urinary tract infection is one, but the lack of fever makes that less likely. Interstitial cystitis is another possibility – that’s chronic bladder inflammation, but it usually presents with pain. We also need to rule out any structural abnormalities or neurological issues. The urinalysis results should be back shortly. While we wait, do you happen to know your last menstrual period date?
PATIENT: Oh. That's… a bit of a personal question, isn’t it? But… yes, I do. It was July 12th. I'm usually very regular, so I'm fairly certain of that date. It's about three weeks ago, as well. I hadn't really considered that might be related, but… I suppose it could be? It's just… I wasn't expecting to discuss that today.
DOCTOR: It’s a pertinent question, Ms. Creagh, and I apologize if it was overly personal. Hormonal fluctuations can sometimes mimic urinary symptoms, so it’s important to rule that out, especially given the recent timing. Ah, the urinalysis results are back. Okay… the urinalysis shows a slightly elevated white blood cell count and some bacteria present. It isn't a definitive diagnosis of a full-blown UTI, but it does indicate some inflammation and potential infection. The red blood cell count is normal.
PATIENT: Okay. So, it is something to do with an infection? Even though I don’t have a fever or pain? What does that mean, Dr. Hembrey? Is it serious? What do we do next?
DOCTOR: It appears to be a mild infection, Ms. Creagh. The lack of fever and pain suggests it's not a severe one, but it does require treatment. We're not going to jump to conclusions about a full-blown UTI just yet. It could be a beginning stage infection, or a simple irritation causing the inflammation. To be on the safe side, and to alleviate your symptoms, I’m going to prescribe a short course of antibiotics. A seven-day course of Nitrofurantoin should suffice. I’ll also recommend increasing your fluid intake significantly – at least eight glasses of water per day. Additionally, I want to rule out any other potential causes. I’m going to order a post-void residual volume test – that will measure how much urine is left in your bladder after you urinate. And, just to be thorough, I’d like you to schedule a follow-up appointment in two weeks to reassess your symptoms and discuss the results of that test. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: That all sounds… reasonable, Dr. Hembrey. Antibiotics, more water, a test to see how much is left in my bladder, and a follow-up appointment. Yes, that sounds acceptable. I just… I hope it clears up quickly. I really dislike feeling like this. Will the antibiotics have any side effects? And what if the test shows something else is wrong? I suppose I’m just anxious.
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety, Ms. Creagh. It's perfectly normal to feel that way. As for side effects, Nitrofurantoin can sometimes cause nausea, loss of appetite, or a metallic taste in your mouth. Those are usually mild and resolve on their own, but please let me know if they become bothersome. More rarely, it can cause some dizziness or skin rash, so stop the medication immediately and contact me if you experience either of those. As for the post-void residual volume test, it's a simple, painless procedure. It's done by a nurse after you urinate, and it helps us determine if your bladder is emptying completely. If the results are abnormal, we may need to consider further testing, such as a bladder ultrasound or a referral to a urologist. But let's not jump to conclusions just yet. Let’s try the antibiotics and see how you respond. I'll have the nurse print out your prescription and instructions for the antibiotics, as well as schedule your follow-up appointment. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so, Dr. Hembrey. You’ve covered everything very thoroughly. Thank you for taking the time to listen to me and explain everything so clearly. I really appreciate your help. Hopefully, this will clear up quickly and I can get back to normal.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Creagh. I’m glad I could help. Remember, if your symptoms worsen at any time, or if you develop a fever, chills, or any new symptoms, contact our office immediately. The nurse will be right in to assist you. I wish you a speedy recovery. It was a pleasure meeting you.
PATIENT: It was a pleasure meeting you as well, Dr. Hembrey. Thank you again for everything. .
