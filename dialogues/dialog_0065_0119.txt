DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Wartick. I'm Dr. Duplichan. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s rather embarrassing, to be frank. I… I’ve noticed something… unusual with my… companion. A gentleman friend, you see. And it’s a bit… messy. A discharge, if you must know. It's simply not hygienic, really. And frankly, I expected better.
DOCTOR: Messy, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, messy! It's… well, it’s not a pleasant sight. And it has a… color to it. Not a good color, I assure you. It’s not something one expects, especially not after… well, after everything. He should be taking better care of himself, really. I mean, one has standards, you know. It's simply unsanitary.
DOCTOR: Right. And this… gentleman friend… is this a recent development, or has this been ongoing?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no. It hasn’t been recent. It’s been… accumulating, shall we say? For a little while now. I just… I hoped it would resolve itself. One doesn’t simply discuss these things, you know. But it's become… noticeable. And rather bothersome, if I'm being honest. I really do expect a certain level of… order.
DOCTOR: Ms. Wartick, with all due respect, are you referring to a medical issue with a person, or are you describing a problem with a… pet?
PATIENT: A pet?! Good heavens, no! I am speaking of a gentleman! A… a companion! Are you suggesting I’m… uncouth? I assure you, Doctor, I have standards. It’s a private matter, naturally, and a bit delicate. I simply came for a… a professional opinion on a… personal problem. Really, the implication!
DOCTOR: Ms. Wartick, I need you to be direct with me. I am a physician, and I require accurate information to provide appropriate care. You are describing a discharge from a male companion. Is this companion a human being, or an animal?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, your persistence is quite… forward. It is a human being, yes. A perfectly respectable, if somewhat… indiscreet, gentleman. And I don’t see why his anatomy is any concern of yours beyond providing a… remedy for this unfortunate situation. It’s simply embarrassing enough as it is! One doesn’t usually have to explain these things to a doctor.
DOCTOR: Ms. Wartick, a discharge from a male human companion… that would typically involve a visit to a urologist. I am an internist. While I can certainly document your concern, I am not the appropriate specialist to address this. Could you please clarify where this discharge is originating from?
PATIENT: Well, obviously… from him. Where else would it originate? Honestly, Doctor, are you even listening? It’s… below. The… private area. It's rather obvious, isn’t it? I’m not going to get into graphic details with a complete stranger! I simply want it fixed! It's terribly unhygienic, and frankly, it’s ruining everything. I came to you because the receptionist said you handle… delicate matters. Is that not correct?
DOCTOR: Ms. Wartick, the receptionist likely meant I handle delicate medical matters. A discharge from a male… is a urological concern. To be absolutely clear, are you describing a penile discharge?
PATIENT: Oh! Good heavens. Well… if you must put it that way… yes. A… a penile discharge. It’s terribly vulgar, but yes. Are you quite sure you can’t assist? It’s just… I’d rather not have to explain all this to another doctor. It’s dreadfully embarrassing. And he’s terribly sensitive, you know. He wouldn't appreciate it at all.
DOCTOR: Ms. Wartick, I understand your discomfort. However, as an internist, I am not equipped to diagnose or treat a penile discharge. This requires a urological examination, and potentially testing to determine the cause. It could be a sexually transmitted infection, or another medical condition. I strongly recommend I refer you to a urologist. Would you like me to provide you with a list of specialists in the area?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. A specialist… I suppose I have no choice. It’s just… all this fuss. And the thought of explaining it again… Very well, Doctor. A list would be most appreciated. Though, I do wish this could have been resolved more… discreetly. And please, don’t mention any of this to anyone. It’s a terribly private matter. And he'd be mortified.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Wartick. Here is a list of urologists in the area. I will also document your concern in your chart, noting your preference for discretion. It's important to seek prompt medical attention, as some causes of penile discharge can be serious. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don’t think so. Just… thank you. I suppose. And please, do emphasize the need for discretion when I call. He's a very proud man, you see. I do hope this is resolved quickly. It's been quite a stressful experience. Good day.
