DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Ms. Swaby. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Chagaris. It's nice to meet you. To start, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon to you as well, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you too. Well, truthfully, it’s…difficult to explain. My speech, you see. It hasn’t been quite right lately. Slurred, I believe my husband said. I don’t recall exactly when it started, but it’s been worrying me.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's certainly concerning when you notice a change in your speech. “Slurred” is a good way to describe it. And it’s good you’ve noticed it and are seeking it checked out. To help me understand what's going on, could you tell me a bit more about when you first noticed this change?
PATIENT: Oh dear…that’s…a difficult question. It wasn’t sudden, not that I recall. More like…a gradual thing. Perhaps a few weeks ago? Or maybe longer? Honestly, Doctor, my memory isn’t what it used to be. I do know it’s been more noticeable recently, especially when I’m trying to explain something complicated. My work…it requires a bit of clear speaking, you understand.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Ms. Swaby. It's common for things to develop gradually, and memory can sometimes be affected by various factors. Don’t worry about being precise; we’ll sort through it. You mentioned your work requires clear speaking – what kind of work do you do?
PATIENT: I am a Construction Manager, Doctor. A rather demanding position, if I may say so myself. Lots of coordinating, and explaining things to the crews. Making sure everyone understands the plans, the timelines…it all requires very precise communication. It’s…important work.
DOCTOR: That is demanding work, Ms. Swaby. It requires a great deal of focus and clear communication, as you said. And it sounds like you take it very seriously. Has this speech change affected your ability to perform your duties at work?
PATIENT: It has, Doctor. Not drastically, thankfully. But there have been…misunderstandings. I have to repeat myself more often, and sometimes…well, sometimes people look at me strangely. It’s frustrating, and it makes me a bit anxious, to be honest. I don’t want to slow things down on the job site, or cause any errors. It's concerning, and it’s been weighing on my mind.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. Swaby. It sounds very stressful to have this impacting your work and causing you anxiety. We need to investigate what's going on. Besides the difficulty at work, have you noticed any other symptoms along with the slurred speech?
PATIENT: Hmm…let me see. No…not that I can readily recall. My husband hasn’t mentioned anything, and I haven’t been feeling unwell, not physically. Perhaps a little more tired than usual, but I attribute that to the stress, truthfully. No dizziness, no headaches…nothing obvious. It really is mostly just the speech.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you experienced any weakness in your arms or legs?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not at all. My strength feels…normal. I’ve been doing some gardening, you see, and I haven't noticed any difficulty lifting or carrying things. I do enjoy keeping busy, when I can.
DOCTOR: Good. And have you noticed any changes in your vision – blurry vision, double vision, or any difficulty seeing?
PATIENT: Now that you mention it…perhaps a little bit of blurriness sometimes, especially at the end of the day. But I wear glasses, Doctor. And I assumed it was just my prescription needing adjusting. It’s not been significant enough to warrant a visit to the optician, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: That makes sense, Ms. Swaby. It’s good you’ve been aware of that. Okay, before we move on, have you had any recent illnesses – a cold, the flu, anything like that?
PATIENT: Let me think… I believe I had a little cold a few months back, perhaps in the spring. Nothing serious, just a bit of a sniffle and a cough. It didn’t last long, and I recovered quickly. No fever, no complications, if that’s what you’re asking.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Do you have any known medical conditions – high blood pressure, diabetes, anything like that?
PATIENT: Well…my husband says I have slightly high cholesterol, but it’s been managed with diet, he tells me. Nothing that requires medication, thankfully. And… I had a rather difficult pregnancy, many years ago. Preeclampsia, I believe it was called. But I recovered fully, and haven’t had any issues since.
DOCTOR: Okay, both of those are important to know. And have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for any reason other than the pregnancy complications?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not that I recall. I’ve always been rather lucky, health-wise. A few minor injuries here and there – a sprained ankle when I was younger, a chipped tooth – but nothing that required a hospital stay or surgery. I’ve always been careful, you see.
DOCTOR: Good to know. Now, thinking about your family…are there any medical conditions that run in your family – heart disease, stroke, neurological problems, anything like that?
PATIENT: That’s…a difficult question, Doctor. My mother passed away several years ago, and I wasn’t particularly close to my father. I believe my grandfather had something with his heart, but I don’t recall the specifics. My husband says there’s a history of diabetes on his side of the family, but I’m not certain. It's a bit vague, truthfully.
DOCTOR: That's alright, Ms. Swaby. It's common for family medical history to be vague. Anything you can recall is helpful, but it’s not a problem if it’s limited. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I don't take anything regularly. I try to avoid medication whenever possible. Perhaps a pain reliever now and then for a headache, but nothing consistent. I believe in a healthy diet and getting plenty of rest, you see.
DOCTOR: Good. And finally, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not that I am aware of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. I can eat anything, take anything, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Swaby, thank you for providing me with that information. Now, I'd like to perform a brief physical examination to get a better understanding of what's going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that is perfectly alright. Whatever you deem necessary. I trust your judgement entirely.
DOCTOR: Excellent. We’ll start with your vital signs – blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. Then, I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your neurological function – reflexes, balance, and coordination – and briefly examine your mouth and throat. It shouldn’t take long. Your blood pressure is 138 over 82. A little elevated, but not overly concerning at the moment. Your heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Eyes tracking normally. Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally – that’s within the normal range. Oral mucosa appears healthy. No obvious signs of infection in the throat. Now, could you please say “ah” for me?
PATIENT: Ah.
DOCTOR: Please repeat after me: “The sky is blue.”
PATIENT: The…sky…is…blue.
DOCTOR: Thank you. Now, could you stick your tongue out for me, please?
PATIENT: 
DOCTOR: Thank you. Your tongue appears normal in terms of color and size, and I see no fasciculations. Okay, Ms. Swaby, based on what you’ve told me and the physical examination, your speech does sound slightly slurred, and that’s concerning. The neurological exam is largely normal, but the speech abnormality warrants further investigation. I'm noting a slightly elevated blood pressure as well. Given your symptoms, I'd like to order a few tests to rule out some potential causes. Specifically, I’m going to order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a Vitamin B12 level. I also recommend a brain MRI to get a better look at your brain structure and rule out any neurological issues. Do you have any questions about these tests?
PATIENT: A brain MRI…Doctor, is that…serious? What are we looking for, exactly? And a Vitamin B12 level…I hadn’t even considered that. I trust your judgement, of course, but it all sounds rather…extensive.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. Swaby. It does sound like a lot, and I want to assure you that we are ordering these tests to be thorough and rule out any potential serious causes. The MRI is the most concerning sounding, I agree. The MRI will help us visualize your brain and look for any signs of stroke, tumor, multiple sclerosis, or other neurological conditions that could be causing your speech changes. It’s non-invasive – you’ll simply lie in a scanner. The blood tests – the complete blood count and comprehensive metabolic panel – will help us assess your overall health, check for any infections or electrolyte imbalances, and look at kidney and liver function. The Vitamin B12 level is important because a deficiency can sometimes cause neurological symptoms, including speech problems. We are starting with the most likely and easily rule-out causes first. Do you have any questions about any of these tests specifically, or the process of getting them done?
PATIENT: No, I think I understand what you’re saying, Doctor. It's just… a little frightening, to be honest. The MRI sounds…intense. And I hadn't even considered a Vitamin deficiency. How long will it take to get the results? And…what if something is wrong?
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly understandable to be frightened, Ms. Swaby. It’s never easy facing the unknown, and I want to assure you that we will take things one step at a time. The MRI typically takes about 30-60 minutes, and you'll be monitored by a technician throughout the process. You can listen to music during the scan if you like. The blood tests will be processed relatively quickly – usually within a couple of days. We should have the results back by early next week. If something is wrong, we’ll discuss the findings in detail and develop a treatment plan tailored to your specific needs. Depending on the cause, treatment options could range from medication to physical therapy to other interventions. It’s important to remember that many neurological conditions are treatable, and early diagnosis is key. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding strenuous activity and getting plenty of rest. If your speech worsens suddenly or you experience any new symptoms – such as weakness, dizziness, or vision changes – please contact the office immediately. Here are the orders for your blood tests and the referral for the MRI. The radiology center will contact you to schedule an appointment. Do you have any questions about these arrangements?
PATIENT: No, I think I have everything. Thank you, Doctor. Perhaps I should ask my husband to come with me to the MRI? It sounds…a bit overwhelming to go alone.
DOCTOR: That’s an excellent idea, Ms. Swaby. Having someone with you for support can definitely make the MRI experience less stressful. It's perfectly acceptable – and often recommended – to have a companion. Is there anything else I can do for you today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I believe that is all. You've been very thorough, and I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything so clearly. Thank you again for your help. I suppose I’ll wait to hear from the radiology center, and then we’ll schedule the MRI. I hope you have a good day, Doctor.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Swaby. I'm glad I could help. Please don't hesitate to contact the office if you have any questions or concerns before your appointment. We'll be here to support you every step of the way. Have a good day as well, and please take care.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your kindness.
