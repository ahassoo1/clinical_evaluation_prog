DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kammer. I'm Dr. Pirl. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, to get started, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. Pirl, you say? Hmm. Well, it's… it's a small thing, really. Not a proper sickness. My daughter, she thinks I need… a card. A “get well” card. From a doctor. She worries too much, that one. But she says it would… encourage me. I just need you to write something on it, that's all. A little note.
DOCTOR: I see. A medical note for reassurance… While not a typical consultation, I understand your daughter’s concern. To provide a helpful note, perhaps you could tell me a little bit about why she feels you need one?
PATIENT: Why she feels I need one? Honestly, Doctor, I don’t know! She just… does. She’s always been like that. Always fussing. I’m a perfectly healthy man! I work hard, I keep busy. Stationary engineer, you know? Boilers don't run themselves. But she says I've been… down. A little bit sad. She says a note from you would make things better. It's… a waste of your time, really. But she paid for the visit, so… here I am.
DOCTOR: I understand. Well, even if it's just for peace of mind, let's gather a little information. Have you noticed yourself feeling more sad than usual, Mr. Kammer?
PATIENT: Sad? Well… I wouldn’t say sad. More like… tired. Everything feels a bit… heavy, you know? Like I’m carrying something. Work is work, it’s always been hard, but now it feels… harder. Not physically, mind you. My back is fine. It's… inside. Like a weight on my chest. It’s just… getting older, I suppose. It happens to everyone. But I don’t need a card for that! I just need you to write something nice for my daughter. She'll be happy then.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s good that you’re acknowledging these feelings, Mr. Kammer. To get a better picture, could you tell me if you’ve experienced any changes in your sleep or appetite recently?
PATIENT: Sleep? Well, I sleep alright. Not as soundly as I used to, maybe. I wake up a couple times a night. Nothing a little water can’t fix. And appetite… I eat. Not much, but I eat. My daughter makes me soup. Too much soup, if you ask me. She thinks I’m wasting away. I tell you, she worries too much. Everything is just… slower. Everything takes more effort. But I’m not sick! I just need a card. Are we getting closer to this card, Doctor? I have things to do, you know.
DOCTOR: I understand your desire to get this sorted quickly. Regarding the feeling of weight on your chest, does it come on with activity, or is it constant?
PATIENT: Constant, mostly. It’s not a pain, you understand. More like… pressure. Like someone is sitting on my chest. It doesn't get worse when I work, surprisingly. The boilers keep me busy, take my mind off things. But when I’m sitting still… that’s when I notice it. And it makes it hard to… breathe, sometimes. Just a little bit. Not enough to worry about. I’ve had it for… a while now, I suppose. Months, maybe. My daughter just noticed it recently. She has a knack for noticing things. Still, I’d really appreciate it if we could just get to the card. It would make her so happy.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Kammer. Just to be thorough, I’d like to listen to your heart and lungs. It’s a quick listen, just to rule out anything obvious. If you could just sit back and relax, please. Your heart sounds… a little bit fast, Mr. Kammer, but regular. Lungs are clear. Blood pressure is slightly elevated as well. It's not alarming, but something we should keep an eye on. It's good we are getting this checked out.
PATIENT: Elevated? I haven’t been to a doctor in… years. Everything always felt fine. Boilers are demanding work, maybe that's it? They're old machines, always making noise. I get worked up fixing them sometimes. But I don’t feel sick, Doctor. Really. So, about the card… what exactly are you going to write? “He’s perfectly healthy, just a bit old”? That would make her happy, I think. Or maybe just, “He’s a strong man, don’t worry about him”? Anything would be better than nothing. Are we finally getting somewhere?
DOCTOR: Mr. Kammer, while you may not feel sick, these findings – the slightly fast heart rate and elevated blood pressure – warrant a little more attention. It’s possible it’s just stress from your work, but we should rule out any underlying causes. Before writing a note, I’d like to order a simple blood test to check your cholesterol and thyroid levels. It’s a routine check, just to be safe. And perhaps an EKG to look at your heart rhythm. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Tests? Now you’re talking about tests? Doctor, I just want a card! A little note to make my daughter happy. I’m a perfectly functional man, I work every day. I don’t need tests, I need… reassurance. All this poking and prodding… it’s making me more anxious than I already am! Honestly, it’s all a bit much. Can't you just write something nice and be done with it? “He’s a resilient worker, full of energy” or “He’s a strong man, don’t worry about him”? That's all I need. I don't want to spend the whole day in a clinic. It's a waste of my time, and yours. Are you sure you can’t just… write the card?
DOCTOR: Mr. Kammer, I understand your frustration. You’re right; you came here for a simple reassurance, and I apologize for making things more complicated. Alright. I will write a note for your daughter, as you requested. But I must also strongly recommend that you schedule a follow-up appointment with me in a few weeks, so we can discuss these readings further and ensure everything is alright. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: A follow-up? Hmm… a few weeks. Alright. Yes, alright, I can do that. As long as you write the note now. Something positive, something reassuring. “He’s a strong man, full of energy and resilience” perhaps? Or maybe, “He is a dedicated worker, doing important work”? That would make her happy. Yes, yes, those are good. And you promise you'll write it now? Before I leave? I have boilers to fix, you know. They don't run themselves. And my daughter is expecting this card. It's very important to her.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Kammer, I promise. I will write the note now. “He is a dedicated worker, doing important work” is perfect. "To [Daughter’s Name], Mr. Kammer is a dedicated and resilient worker performing important work. He is in good spirits and maintains a strong, active lifestyle. Sincerely, Dr. Cinde Pirl, MD" Here you are. I hope this brings your daughter some peace of mind. And please, do schedule that follow-up appointment. It’s important to prioritize your health. I’ll have the receptionist set something up before you leave. Now, is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: Perfect! That's… that's exactly what she needs to hear. "Dedicated and resilient." Yes. Thank you, Doctor. That's very kind of you. No, no, that's all. Just the note. And thank you again. You've been… patient. I appreciate that. Please, just make sure the receptionist doesn't try to schedule me for a whole battery of tests right away. A simple follow-up, that's all. Just to check things, you understand. Now, if you'll excuse me, I really must get back to the boilers. They're not getting any younger, you know. Good day, Doctor. And thank you again. You’re a good doctor.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Kammer. I will ensure the receptionist schedules a simple follow-up appointment for you. Please take care, and don't hesitate to contact us if you have any concerns. Have a good day. .
