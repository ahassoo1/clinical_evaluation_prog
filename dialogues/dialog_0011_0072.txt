DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Heidenthal. My name is Dr. Christopher Neppl. It’s a pleasure to meet you. So, to begin, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Dr. Neppl. It's nice to meet you too. Well, it's a bit embarrassing, but I've been having trouble with my memory lately. It's… worrying me, to be honest.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Heidenthal. It's certainly reasonable to be concerned about changes in your memory. It's good you're addressing it. Can you tell me a little more about what you mean by “trouble with your memory”?
PATIENT: Hmm, where to start? It's not like I’m forgetting everything, but… little things. Like, I’ll go into a room and forget why I went in there. Or I’ll have trouble remembering people’s names, even people I’ve met a few times. And sometimes… words. The right word just won’t come to me. It's frustrating.
DOCTOR: I see. So, it sounds like you're experiencing some difficulties with recall—both recent events and finding the right words. When did you first start noticing these issues?
PATIENT: That's a good way to put it, recall. It has been getting worse, I think. Let me see… it started, oh, maybe six months ago? At first, I just thought I was stressed, you know? Work has been busy. But it hasn’t really gotten better, and if anything, it feels like it’s a little more frequent now.
DOCTOR: Okay, six months ago, with a gradual worsening of symptoms. And you associate the initial onset with increased work-related stress. Has anything else significant been going on in your life during that time—any major life changes, illnesses, or injuries?
PATIENT: Not really, no. Work's been the main thing, honestly. I did have a bad cold in the winter, but that was pretty standard. Nothing else that I can really think of that would… stick out. I’ve been pretty healthy otherwise. I try to eat well and get some exercise when I can, but with the job… it's hard sometimes.
DOCTOR: Alright. And could you describe a typical instance of forgetting why you entered a room, for example?
PATIENT: Oh, okay. So, like yesterday. I was in the kitchen, making coffee, and my husband asked me to get the mail. I went to the front door, got the mail, and then… I just stood there. Completely blank. I knew I had something in my hands, and I was in the house, but I couldn't for the life of me remember what I was doing or where I was going. It took a minute to remember I had the mail and went back to the kitchen. It's just… odd. And embarrassing!
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Heidenthal, and it's perfectly reasonable to feel embarrassed. These are important details. Now, let’s move on to a brief review of your overall health. Do you have any current medical conditions that we should discuss?
PATIENT: No, not really. I mean, I have a little bit of high blood pressure, but it's pretty well controlled with medication. Otherwise, I’m generally healthy. No diabetes, no heart problems, nothing like that. And I take a multivitamin, just to be safe.
DOCTOR: Okay, well-controlled hypertension, managed with medication, and a daily multivitamin. Good. And have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Let me think… I had my tonsils out when I was a kid, a long time ago. And I broke my wrist when I was in college, playing volleyball, but that healed up fine. Nothing else, not that I can remember. Small things, really.
DOCTOR: Alright, tonsillectomy as a child and a healed wrist fracture. And regarding family history, are there any instances of memory loss, dementia, or other neurological conditions in your immediate family—parents, siblings?
PATIENT: That's a good question. My mom… she had some trouble with her memory in her later years, yeah. Not a formal diagnosis or anything, but she’d repeat stories a lot, and forget things occasionally. My dad was pretty sharp right up until the end, though. And I don't think any of my siblings have had any problems. It was mostly just my mom.
DOCTOR: I see. Maternal history of some memory issues. And finally, let's quickly touch on your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, I don't smoke. I have a glass of wine with dinner maybe once or twice a week. And definitely no recreational drugs. Never have, never will. I just don't really care for them.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Heidenthal. That's helpful information. Now, to get a better understanding of what might be going on, I'd like to perform a brief cognitive assessment. This will involve a few simple questions and tasks to evaluate your memory, attention, and other mental functions. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine. I'm happy to do whatever you think is necessary to figure this out. Just let me know what you'd like me to do. I hope it's not too embarrassing!
DOCTOR: It's nothing to worry about, Ms. Heidenthal. It’s a standard part of the evaluation. Alright, let’s begin. First, I’m going to ask you to recall three unrelated words. Please listen carefully. The words are: apple, table, penny. Repeat them back to me now.
PATIENT: Okay, let me see… apple, table, penny. Did I get those right?
DOCTOR: Perfect. Now, I'm going to ask you a few questions about your current day. What is today’s date?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Let me think… it’s… August 2nd. Is it 2025? I think so. Yes, August 2nd, 2025. I hope I got that right! I'm starting to feel a little flustered.
DOCTOR: That's alright, Ms. Heidenthal. You did get the date correct. Now, can you tell me what city we are in?
PATIENT: Hmm… that's a silly question. We’re… I'm in the city where the clinic is, right? It’s… I want to say… is it New York? No… wait. It’s… I’m terrible with cities. I know I’m in a city, a big one, but the name is escaping me. Oh, this is awful.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Ms. Heidenthal. It's understandable to feel a little stressed during this assessment. It doesn't necessarily indicate a problem. Now, I'm going to ask you to spell the word "world" backwards. Take your time.
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Backwards… okay, let me think… d-l-r-o-w… is that right? Oh, this is hard. I’m so sorry. I’m usually much better with things like this. I just feel… off.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Heidenthal. That’s perfectly fine. Now, let’s go back to those three words I asked you to remember earlier: apple, table, penny. Can you recall them for me again?
PATIENT: Oh… oh dear. Um… I think… I remember one of them… apple? Was table one of them? I’m so sorry. I just… I can’t seem to pull them back up. It’s like they’re floating just out of reach. This is really upsetting.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Heidenthal. That's enough for now. Based on this brief assessment and your reported symptoms, it appears there may be some cognitive impairment that warrants further investigation. I want to assure you that this doesn't necessarily mean anything serious, but it's important to rule out any underlying causes. I recommend we proceed with some blood work to check for vitamin deficiencies, thyroid issues, and other potential medical conditions that can affect memory. Additionally, I'd like to refer you to a neurologist for a more comprehensive cognitive evaluation and possibly an MRI of your brain to rule out any structural abnormalities. How does that sound?
PATIENT: That… sounds like a good plan. A little scary, maybe, but… good. I just want to know what’s going on. And hopefully, it's something fixable. What’s the next step? Do you want to do the blood work here?
DOCTOR: Yes, we can certainly do the blood work here. I'll write you an order for a comprehensive metabolic panel, a complete blood count, a thyroid stimulating hormone level, and a Vitamin B12 level. We’ll also check your folate level. The lab is just down the hall, and they should be able to take care of you right away. Once the results are back, typically within a few days, we'll schedule an appointment for you with Dr. Anya Sharma, a neurologist I work with. She’s excellent. While we’re waiting for the results, I also want you to keep a detailed journal of any memory lapses or difficulties you experience, including the date, time, and specific details. This will be helpful for Dr. Sharma. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that all sounds very good. A journal, okay I can do that. I’ll try to write everything down as soon as I notice it, so I don’t forget. And Dr. Sharma… I’ll remember that name. Just, getting the blood work done first sounds like a good place to start. Thank you, Dr. Neppl. I really appreciate you taking the time to listen and not just dismiss it. I was worried you’d think I was just being silly.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Heidenthal. I'm glad I could help. It's important to me that you feel heard and that we address your concerns thoroughly. It's never silly to be concerned about your health, especially when it comes to cognitive function. I’ll have the lab order printed for you now. And if you experience any sudden changes in your condition—such as confusion, weakness, or difficulty speaking—please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Otherwise, we'll see you back here once the results are available. Do you have any questions for me before we proceed?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. You've explained everything very clearly. Just… I’ll go do the blood work then. Thank you again, Dr. Neppl. I feel a little bit better just knowing we’re doing something.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Heidenthal. I’m glad to hear that. The nurse will escort you to the lab. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns. And remember, we’re here to support you every step of the way. Have a good day, and please take care.
