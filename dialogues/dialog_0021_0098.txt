DOCTOR: Alright, Demondre. Have a seat. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Uh, hi Doctor Havird. Thanks. Well, to be honest... I just been curious, you know? Never really needed a doctor before, not serious-like. Just figured I'd see what it was all about. And, uh, make sure everything’s okay, I guess.
DOCTOR: "Curious," is it?
PATIENT: Yeah. Sounds kinda silly when you say it like that, huh? I work on boats, see? Sailors and… the engine stuff. Oils and things. Lots of guys just tough it out if somethin' hurts. But I been thinkin' maybe that ain't the smartest way. Figured a check-up wouldn’t hurt, even if nothin' is wrong.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, preventative care is… fine. Though, honestly, most people come in with something wrong, not to simply…confirm everything’s working. Still. Let’s get some basics down. You said you work on boats. Is that physically demanding work?
PATIENT: Yeah, it can be. Lots of liftin’, bendin’, crawlin’ in tight spaces. The engines are big and… well, they don't move themselves. Been doin' it for a few years now, so I guess I'm used to it. Sometimes my back gets a little sore, but nothin’ I can’t work through usually. Mostly just tired, you know? Long hours.
DOCTOR: “Used to it” doesn’t mean it’s not doing something. Tiredness is…vague. Soreness is also vague. Let’s be a bit more specific. When was the last time you had any actual pain, not just soreness?
PATIENT: Hmm… actual pain. Okay, lemme see. Maybe… three months ago? I was tryin’ to loosen a bolt, really stuck one, and I kinda… tweaked my shoulder. It hurt bad for a couple days, then just kinda faded. I put some heat on it and kept workin’. Didn’t want to fall behind, you know? It’s mostly okay now, but sometimes I feel a little… pop in there when I lift somethin’ heavy. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: A “pop” is… concerning. And continuing to work through pain is rarely advisable, though I suspect I won’t be able to get you to stop entirely. Alright. Any other injuries?
PATIENT: Nah, not really. I used to play some basketball when I was younger, took a few knocks, sprained an ankle once, but nothin’ serious. Mostly just bumps and bruises. The boat work’s been the worst of it, honestly. Not a lot of fallin’ or anything, just… constant strain, you know? My divorce was harder on my body than anything, if you want the truth. Stress does a number on ya.
DOCTOR: Divorce is… irrelevant to your current medical complaints. Though, I suppose chronic stress can contribute to muscle tension. Let’s move on. Do you have any allergies?
PATIENT: Allergies? Uh… not that I know of. Never really had a problem with pollen or food or anything. Maybe a little itchy sometimes when I’m around cats, but I ain’t got no cats. My ex did, though. Sorry. Just… came outta nowhere.
DOCTOR: Medications?
PATIENT: Nope. Don't take nothin’ regular. Maybe some ibuprofen for a headache now and then, but that’s it. I try to stay away from pills if I can. My grandpappy always said they just mask the problem, don't fix it. I kinda believe him.
DOCTOR: Alright. And your family history?
PATIENT: Family history… hmm. My mom, she had high blood pressure, I think. And her mom… my grandma, she had arthritis, real bad. Couldn't move her hands much towards the end. My dad was healthy as a horse, though. Worked construction his whole life. Strong guy. That's about all I know, honestly. Nobody really talked about health stuff much in my family.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your reflexes, and take a look at your shoulder. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds good. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. Just let me know if somethin' feels weird or anything. I ain't afraid of a little poke and prod.
DOCTOR: Alright. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath in… and out. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs noted. Lungs are clear bilaterally, no wheezes or crackles auscultated. Now, let's check your reflexes. Can you just relax your arms for me?
PATIENT: Okay, relaxin'. I ain’t the most coordinated guy, so don't judge if I flinch or somethin'. Boats move a lot, messes with your balance, you know?
DOCTOR: Patellar reflexes are 2+ bilaterally, normal. Biceps reflexes are also 2+. Now, let’s take a look at your shoulder. Can you rotate your arm for me?
PATIENT: Yeah, sure. There we go. It feels a little stiff, you know? Not a lot of pain, just… tight. Like somethin's stuck in there. Maybe I just need to stretch more.
DOCTOR: There is some tenderness to palpation with internal rotation of the shoulder. Range of motion is slightly limited, but no acute signs of inflammation. Do you feel any pain with this movement?
PATIENT: Yeah, a little. Right there. Not sharp, just… a dull ache. It's been like that for a while now. I just kinda ignore it most of the time. It feels worse when I reach behind my back, like tryin’ to scratch my other shoulder.
DOCTOR: Alright. Based on what you’ve told me and the physical exam, it sounds like you may have a mild rotator cuff strain, possibly aggravated by repetitive overhead movements. It's not severe, but it's something we should address before it gets worse. We can start with some conservative treatment: physical therapy, stretching exercises, and avoiding activities that aggravate the pain.
PATIENT: Physical therapy… that sounds good. I ain’t against tryin’ somethin’ new. I figured it was probably somethin’ like that. Just needed a doctor to tell me, you know? It's good to know it ain't nothin' serious. So, what does the physical therapy involve? Is it gonna be all painful stuff?
DOCTOR: It will involve a series of exercises designed to strengthen the muscles around your shoulder and improve your range of motion. There may be some mild discomfort initially, but it shouldn’t be debilitating pain. The therapist will work with you to develop a plan that’s appropriate for your level of activity and pain tolerance. I can write you a referral to a good physical therapy clinic nearby. And I recommend taking some over-the-counter anti-inflammatory medication, like ibuprofen, to help reduce pain and inflammation.
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds… manageable. A referral, huh? That’s good. And ibuprofen… yeah, I can do that. My mom always swore by it for her headaches. So, no need for any fancy tests or anything? Just the therapy and the pills? I was kinda worried they were gonna tell me I needed surgery or somethin'.
DOCTOR: No, no surgery is necessary at this time. Imaging, such as an MRI, is not warranted unless your symptoms worsen or do not improve with conservative treatment. We’ll start with this plan and see how you respond. I’m also going to recommend some basic shoulder stretches to do at home, and I’ll provide you with a handout detailing those exercises. Here’s the referral to the physical therapy clinic, and the handout with the exercises. Please follow the instructions carefully, and schedule an appointment with the therapist as soon as possible. Do you have any other questions for me?
PATIENT: Nope, I think that covers everything. Thanks, Doctor Havird. You put my mind at ease, honestly. I was worried it was somethin' serious. Just a strain, huh? That's good. I appreciate you takin' the time to explain everything so clearly. I'll get the therapy scheduled, and I'll try not to lift too much stuff.
DOCTOR: Good. Remember, listen to your body, and don’t hesitate to contact the clinic if your symptoms worsen. Have a good day, Demondre.
PATIENT: You too, Doctor. Thanks again. .
