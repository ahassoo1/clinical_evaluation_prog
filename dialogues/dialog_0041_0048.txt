DOCTOR: Hello, Colt. Good to meet you. I'm Dr. Polczynski. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, good to meet you too, Doctor. Though I don’t see what a young man like yourself can do for an old timer like me. But my wife insisted, said I’ve been…forgetful. Not me, exactly, but… episodes, she calls them. Confusion, mostly. It's been happening a few times now.
DOCTOR: Hmm, okay. “Episodes” of confusion… I understand. It’s good your wife is looking out for you, and it’s definitely worth getting it checked out. It's not about age, Colt, it’s about figuring out what’s going on. Can you tell me a bit more about these episodes?
PATIENT: More about them… Honestly, it's embarrassing. I just… blank. Like a television with no signal. I know who I am, mind you. And where I am, usually. But I can’t… follow a conversation. Or finish a task. Last week, my wife asked me to get the mail. I stood there for twenty minutes, staring at the mailbox, couldn't remember why I was even holding the keys. She had to practically drag me back inside. It’s not like I’m losing my mind completely, just… moments. Brief moments. But they’re getting more frequent, she says.
DOCTOR: Okay, so brief moments of confusion, trouble with following conversations or completing tasks... and your wife has noticed they're becoming more frequent. That's helpful to know. Do these moments happen at a specific time of day, or after certain activities?
PATIENT: No, not that I’ve noticed. It seems pretty random, really. Could be morning, could be afternoon. I was working on the tile in Mr. Henderson’s bathroom yesterday, perfectly fine. Then, boom. Staring at a perfectly good grout line, couldn’t remember what color the tile was supposed to be. Had to ask his wife, and she'd already told me! It’s… frustrating, to say the least. It makes me feel… useless. And slow. I used to have a memory like a steel trap, you know? Could remember every single tile I ever laid. Every customer, every job. Now… Not so much.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Colt. It's definitely concerning when things change like that, especially with something you used to be so good at. So, it sounds like these episodes are impacting your work as well. Do you ever feel dizzy or have a headache before or during these moments?
PATIENT: No, no dizziness. And no headaches either. It just… happens. Like a switch flips. Everything's normal, then suddenly… empty. It's not painful, not uncomfortable, just… gone. Like someone turned off a light. Sometimes I feel a little… flustered afterwards, like I’ve missed something important. But that's about it. My wife keeps asking if I'm getting enough sleep, but I sleep just fine. Always have. I’m a practical man, Doctor. I don’t believe in these… airy-fairy explanations. Something physical must be going on.
DOCTOR: You're right to think something physical might be going on, Colt. We'll definitely investigate that. Just to get a fuller picture, have you noticed any changes in your vision recently?
PATIENT: Vision? No, not really. I wear glasses, always have. Got new ones last year, the prescription was the same as always. I can see fine. Read the newspaper every morning, watch the news. I can see just as well as I always have. Though… now that you mention it… sometimes things seem a little… blurry. Not all the time, just… occasionally. Like looking through a dirty window. But I figured that was just my old eyes getting worse. It’s to be expected, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: It is to be expected with age, yes, but we should still check it out. Okay, and just to cover all the bases, have you had any falls or bumps to the head recently, even minor ones?
PATIENT: No falls, no bumps. I'm a careful man. Been working with tile for forty years, you learn to watch your step. And my wife keeps a close eye on me these days, makes sure I don't overdo it. She fusses over me something awful, but… I suppose it’s good. No, nothing like that. Honestly, Doctor, I’m starting to feel like you’re looking for anything but a real reason. Is it possible… something’s wrong with my brain?
DOCTOR: It's good your wife is watching out for you. And you're right to ask about your brain, Colt. It’s absolutely possible, and that’s what we’re here to investigate. It’s important to rule things out systematically. Before we get to that, I'd like to ask a little about your past medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions, like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Well, I had a bit of a scare with my heart about ten years ago. Doctor said it was just a flutter, nothing serious. Put me on some medication for a while, but I stopped taking it after a year. He said it was okay. Other than that… nothing much. My wife keeps nagging me to get my blood pressure checked, but I feel fine. Always have. I eat healthy, mostly. Rice and fish, lots of vegetables. I’m a simple man, Doctor. Don’t need fancy medicine or complicated treatments.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a heart flutter about ten years ago, which was treated and resolved. And you generally feel healthy. Do you remember the name of the medication you were on for your heart?
PATIENT: Hmm… that was a long time ago. Let me think… It was a little white pill. Small. I think… maybe… Amlodipine? Or something like that. It started with an “A”. My wife would know for sure, she kept track of everything. I just took what she gave me. She's very organized. But it wasn't for long, just a few months. And the doctor said it wasn't anything serious, so I didn’t bother to remember the details. Does it matter? I haven't taken it in years.
DOCTOR: It's helpful to know, Colt, even if it was years ago. Okay, and have you had any surgeries in your life?
PATIENT: Surgeries… let me see. Oh, yes! I had my appendix out when I was a boy. That was… sixty years ago, maybe more? It was a simple operation, nothing fancy. And… I had a hernia repaired about twenty years ago. That was a bit more painful, but I recovered quickly. Other than that… nothing. I’m a tough old bird, Doctor. Don’t break easily.
DOCTOR: Okay, appendix removal as a child, and a hernia repair about twenty years ago. Now, thinking about your family… are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. My mother… she had some problems with her memory towards the end of her life. But she was very old. Lived to be ninety-five. My father… he had high blood pressure, I think. And my brother… he had some kind of heart trouble. But that’s about it. We weren’t a particularly sickly family. Mostly strong, hard-working people. We didn’t talk much about health problems, honestly.
DOCTOR: Okay, so some memory issues in your mother, high blood pressure in your father, and heart trouble in your brother. Now, one last question about your history: do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies. None at all. I can eat anything, take any medicine. Never had a reaction to anything in my life. I’m a very simple man, Doctor. Plain food, plain medicine, plain life. No complications. You’re asking a lot of questions, you know? Are you getting anywhere with this?
DOCTOR: You're right, Colt, that’s a lot of questions. It's just to get a complete picture. Alright, let’s move on to a quick physical exam. I’m going to check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and do a basic neurological exam to assess your reflexes and balance. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Fine. Get it over with. Though I doubt you'll find anything wrong. My wife worries too much. Just don't poke me too much. I'm an old man, my skin is delicate.
DOCTOR: I'll be gentle, Colt. Okay, your blood pressure is 148 over 92. A little elevated, but not terribly concerning given your anxiety. Heart sounds are regular, but there's a slight murmur. We’ll need to investigate that further. Lungs are clear. Reflexes are a bit diminished, and your balance is slightly unsteady. No obvious deficits, but worth noting. Okay, Colt. Everything seems relatively normal, but there are a few things I want to investigate further. The elevated blood pressure, the heart murmur, and the diminished reflexes and balance. I’m going to order some blood work to check your overall health and rule out any underlying medical conditions. And I’d also like to order an EKG to evaluate your heart function. How does that sound?
PATIENT: EKG… blood work… More tests? Honestly, Doctor, this is what I was afraid of. It’s always something with you people. But… alright. If you think it’s necessary. Just… don’t keep me waiting too long. I have a job to finish. And my wife will be furious if I’m gone all day. What exactly do these tests look for? I like to know what's going on, you know? Don’t want any surprises.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Colt. I'll explain everything as clearly as I can. The blood work will give us a snapshot of your overall health – things like your blood sugar, kidney function, thyroid levels, and vitamin levels. It can help us identify any underlying issues that might be contributing to your confusion. The EKG, or electrocardiogram, measures the electrical activity of your heart. It can detect any irregular heart rhythms, signs of a heart attack, or other heart problems. Essentially, we're just trying to rule out any physical causes for your symptoms. It’s possible this is nothing serious, but it’s important to be thorough. It may also be worthwhile to get a brain scan - a CT or MRI - to assess your brain structure and rule out any issues like a stroke or tumor. But let's start with the blood work and EKG and see what those reveal first. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: A brain scan? Now you're just trying to scare me! I don't have a tumor, Doctor. I'm a practical man, not some… some invalid. Look, I’m willing to do the blood work and this… EKG thing. But no brain scans. Not yet. I want to see what the other tests say first. And I want you to explain the results to me in plain English. No medical jargon. Understand?
DOCTOR: You're absolutely right to ask questions and express your concerns, Colt. I completely understand. No brain scan for now. We’ll start with the blood work and EKG, and we’ll discuss the results in plain English, no medical jargon. I promise. I’m also going to write you a referral to a neurologist. It’s always good to get a second opinion, and a neurologist is a specialist in brain health. They can evaluate your symptoms further and determine if any additional testing is necessary. But that’s just a precaution. I’ll have my nurse draw your blood now and schedule you for an EKG. It will only take a few minutes. And then, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment in a week to discuss the results. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Fine. A neurologist… more doctors. My wife will be thrilled. But alright. If that’s what you think is best. Just… get it over with. I have a feeling this is going to be a long week. And please, tell your nurse to be gentle. I don't like needles. Let’s just hope these tests show nothing. I have a job to finish, you know. A man’s got to earn a living.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Colt. I’ll let the nurse know to be as gentle as possible. And I understand. You’ve got a job to finish. We’ll do everything we can to get to the bottom of this quickly and efficiently. Let me just write down the orders for the blood work and EKG. And I’ll have the nurse come in shortly to get started. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms, please don't hesitate to call the office. We’ll get this sorted out, Colt. You're in good hands.
