DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Cassimatis. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Gegan. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, it’s my skin. It’s been so itchy lately. Just driving me crazy, really. It started, oh, maybe a month or so ago? I don’t really know exactly.
DOCTOR: Okay, itchy skin for about a month. I understand that can be very frustrating. Can you tell me a little more about the itch?
PATIENT: Well, it’s all over, really. Not just one spot. Arms, legs… even my back is bothering me. It doesn’t really look like anything’s wrong wrong, you know? No rash, no bumps... just… itchy. And it's worse at night, definitely. Keeps me up sometimes.
DOCTOR: I see. So it’s generalized itching, meaning it’s all over, no visible rash or bumps, and it's particularly bothersome at night. That's helpful to know. Has anything changed recently that you can think of?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Not really. I mean, life is life, you know? I haven't started using any new soaps or lotions, I don’t think so. I did switch laundry detergents a few weeks back... a new brand, just because it was on sale. Could that be it? I don't usually pay much attention to those things, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, a change in laundry detergent is a good thing to note. It’s certainly possible that could be contributing. And you're right to think of that. Let's explore that a bit further, and then we'll go through some other possibilities. Have you noticed the itching improving or worsening at any particular time of day other than nighttime?
PATIENT: Not really… it’s pretty consistent during the day. Maybe a little bit worse when I’m hot, like if I’ve been out in the sun. But it's always there, just… varying levels of annoying. I tried some lotion yesterday, just a regular one I had, but didn’t seem to help much, if at all. It's really just frustrating. I just want it to stop.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Cassimatis. It sounds very bothersome. Okay, so consistent itching, slightly worse with heat, and no relief from a regular lotion. Now, let's talk a little bit about your medical history, if you don't mind. Do you have any other medical conditions that you're aware of, like diabetes, thyroid problems, kidney disease, or liver disease?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… I had a little bit of high blood pressure a while back, but the doctor said it was under control with some pills. I stopped taking those a few years ago, though, when I lost some weight. Other than that… not really. I mean, I’m 70 years old! Things ache a bit here and there, you know? But nothing serious that a doctor ever told me about. No thyroid, no kidney problems… I don’t think so. I'd remember something like that, wouldn't I?
DOCTOR: You would, absolutely. Okay, so a history of high blood pressure that’s currently managed with weight loss – that’s good information. Now, have you had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything in the past?
PATIENT: Let me see… I had my gallbladder out a long, long time ago. Must be 30 years now? And I was in the hospital once when I broke my wrist, but that was just overnight, nothing major. Other than that... no, I don’t think so. Nothing I can recall, anyway. It was a while ago, you know? Old age is a funny thing, makes you forget.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly understandable. Okay, gallbladder removal thirty years ago and a broken wrist. And you said you're currently not taking any medications, correct?
PATIENT: Right, no medications. Just trying to stay active and eat right, that's what my doctor always told me. Though, I haven't seen a doctor in a few years, to be honest. Just been busy with life and feeling okay, mostly. Until this itching, of course. It's really gotten under my skin, pun intended!
DOCTOR: That’s a good one! Alright, Ms. Cassimatis. Now, let’s talk about your family. Do any of your close family members have any skin conditions, like eczema or psoriasis?
PATIENT: Hmm… my mother, she had dry skin, really dry hands, especially in the winter. She used to use a lot of creams, but I don’t think it was anything serious. My brother, he had some sort of allergy when he was a kid, but I don’t remember what it was. Nothing like this though. Nobody I know has ever had something that just… itches all over like this. It’s just so strange!
DOCTOR: Okay, a family history of dry skin in your mother and an allergy in your brother. And to finish up with the history questions, can you tell me a little bit about your social history?
PATIENT: Social history? Oh dear. What does that mean, exactly? I mean, I live alone, I retired from teaching history about ten years ago… I like to read, spend time with my grandkids when I can… Is that what you mean? I don’t smoke, and I hardly ever drink. Just a glass of wine with dinner now and then, if I’m feeling fancy.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's perfect! That's exactly what I mean. It helps me get a better picture of your overall health. So, you don't smoke, you drink occasionally, you live alone and enjoy reading and spending time with your grandchildren. That’s all very helpful. Now, just one last question, have you had any recent travel, or been exposed to anything unusual, like new detergents, plants, or animals?
PATIENT: Oh, I already mentioned the new laundry detergent! Aside from that… no, nothing unusual at all. Haven’t traveled anywhere in years. Mostly just stay around here, visit the grandkids, go to the grocery store… I haven’t even been in the garden this year, too busy with everything else. It’s just been a regular summer, I guess. A very itchy summer, but regular otherwise.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Cassimatis. Thank you for that thorough history. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam to take a closer look at your skin. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Whatever you need to do. I just want to figure out what's causing all this itching! It's driving me crazy.
DOCTOR: Okay. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, and then I’ll take a look at your skin, starting with your arms and legs. I’m just looking for any signs of a rash, dryness, or other abnormalities. Please let me know if anything is tender or uncomfortable. Alright, your heart and lungs sound clear. I’m not seeing any obvious rash or bumps on your arms or legs. Your skin does seem a little dry, but nothing that immediately jumps out as a clear cause for the itching. I’m going to check your back now. Could you please lean forward for me?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Go ahead, take a look. It's been particularly itchy there lately, right on my shoulder blades. It's hard to reach, so I can't really see what's going on. Hopefully you can!
DOCTOR: Alright, I’m not seeing any rash or bumps on your back either. It is a little dry, particularly around your shoulder blades. I’m not feeling any areas of tenderness. Everything seems… normal, visually. I’m going to check your hands and feet now. Alright, everything looks pretty unremarkable. No rash, no lesions, just some mild dryness overall. While it’s good that we're not seeing anything obvious, this doesn't necessarily tell us what is causing the itch. Now, I want to order some blood tests to rule out some common causes. Would that be okay with you?
PATIENT: Blood tests? Oh dear. I don't love needles, but if it helps figure this out, then yes, okay. What are you looking for, exactly? And will it take long?
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly understandable to not love needles! It’s a quick pinch, I promise. We’re going to check a complete blood count, just to make sure everything is normal with your red and white blood cells. We'll also check your thyroid function, your liver enzymes, and your kidney function, just to rule out those as potential causes. We'll also check for diabetes. It’ll take a few days to get the results back, and then we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… thorough. I appreciate you taking the time to look into everything. Diabetes, thyroid… I haven’t thought about those things. Okay, blood tests it is. Where do I go to get them done? And do I need to fast beforehand?
DOCTOR: That’s good, we want to be thorough! The lab is just down the hall, room 102. And yes, you will need to fast for at least 8 hours beforehand. That means no food or drinks, except water. It’s best to schedule the appointment for first thing in the morning. I’ll have the nurse write you a lab order, and she can help you schedule the appointment. Do you have any questions about the fasting or the tests themselves?
PATIENT: Eight hours… okay, I can do that. First thing in the morning… good idea. No, I don’t think so, you’ve explained everything pretty clearly. Just… I hope it’s not anything serious. This itching is really getting to me, and I just want it to stop.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. Cassimatis, and I want to assure you that the itching doesn't necessarily mean it's something serious. It could be a number of things, and we're just trying to rule out the possibilities. We'll get the results back as quickly as possible, and then we can discuss a treatment plan. The nurse will be in shortly to go over the lab order and schedule your appointment. In the meantime, I can recommend a fragrance-free, hypoallergenic moisturizer to help soothe the skin. Would you like me to write that down for you?
PATIENT: Yes, please. That would be lovely. Anything to get some relief. It feels like I'm constantly scratching, even in my sleep. Thank you, Doctor. I really appreciate your help. You've been very kind.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Cassimatis. I'm glad I could help. Here you go. It’s called “CeraVe Moisturizing Cream.” You can find it at most pharmacies. The nurse will be in shortly. In the meantime, try to avoid scratching as much as possible, and wear loose-fitting clothing. If the itching becomes unbearable, an over-the-counter antihistamine like Benadryl might offer some temporary relief, but be aware that it can cause drowsiness. I'll see you at your follow-up appointment once the lab results are back. Do you have any other questions for me before I go?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. You've been very thorough, and I feel a little better knowing we're looking into it. Thank you again, Doctor. I’ll see you at the follow-up. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Cassimatis. I'm glad I could reassure you. Don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your appointment. Have a good day, and try to relax! .
