DOCTOR: Right. Early Kammer, 56. Okay. So, Mr. Kammer, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Uh, yes. That is me. I... I just need a card. From you, Doctor. A get well card. Or... encouragement. Something like that. My niece, she says it helps when you get a card from the doctor. It’s, uh... for morale. She worries about me, you see. A good niece.
DOCTOR: A card?
PATIENT: Yes. A card! You know... with a nice message. Like... “Get better soon!” or “Thinking of you.” My niece, she thinks it shows you care. It’s not, you understand, that I am sick sick. Just… low spirits. Things haven’t been the best. A card from a professional... it has weight.
DOCTOR: Mr. Kammer, with all due respect… I’m a physician. I provide medical care. I don’t… write inspirational cards. Is there something else bothering you?
PATIENT: Now see here, Doctor. I didn’t come here to be talked to like that. I have Medicare, and I am allowed to ask for what I need. A card is a simple request! It’s… it’s about respect. When someone important, like a doctor, takes a moment... it means something. It's good for the... the constitution, you understand? A little pick-me-up.
DOCTOR: Mr. Kammer, I assure you, I treat all my patients with respect. However, your “request” is… unusual. And frankly, it’s taking time away from patients who require medical attention. Now, is there an actual medical problem you’d like me to address?
PATIENT: Now hold on a minute! You are implying I am wasting your time? I came here, didn't I? Filled out all the forms! My niece says a doctor’s visit is good for... for the record, you know? Proof I’m taking care of myself. And a card… it ties it all together! It shows I'm doing something positive. Are you saying my feelings aren't important? This is very… unprofessional, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Look, Mr. Kammer. I have your basic information here – age 56, Puerto Rican, Medicare. No current complaints listed. No prior medical history noted. Are you experiencing any symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Well… not like a fever or anything. It’s more… a feeling. A heaviness. And… things just aren’t going my way. My ex-wife, she's always making trouble. And the plumbing in my building… it’s a disaster. It weighs on a man, you see? A card from you, it would show… solidarity. That someone understands the… the struggles. It’s… a little boost, Doctor. A small thing.
DOCTOR: Mr. Kammer, are you currently experiencing any pain?
PATIENT: Pain? Not exactly. More… a dull ache. In the… spirit, you could say. And… a tightness in the chest. Not from the heart! From… worry. It’s the plumbing, mostly. And the ex-wife. Always with the complaining. A card, it would be… soothing. It’s hard to explain. It would show… consideration. You know, that you hear me.
DOCTOR: Chest tightness... and stress related to plumbing and an ex-wife. Have you been experiencing any shortness of breath, nausea, dizziness, or palpitations?
PATIENT: Now you’re listing things! Like I’m supposed to know medical terms! No, no shortness of breath. A little dizzy sometimes, maybe. From… the heat. And… sometimes my stomach feels unsettled. From… worrying about the plumbing. It's very old pipes, you understand? Always leaking. And the ex-wife… she loves to tell everyone about it. A card would just... validate my struggles, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Mr. Kammer, let's try this another way. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or sleep patterns recently?
PATIENT: Changes? Well… the appetite isn't what it used to be. Not much interest in cooking when you’re worried about pipes bursting. And the sleep... it’s restless. Always thinking about the ex-wife and what trouble she’s making now. I toss and turn. A card, Doctor... it would give me something positive to think about before sleep. Something to… settle the nerves. It's basic psychology, you know.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Kammer. It sounds like you are experiencing some stress and anxiety related to personal matters. While I understand you'd like a card, that’s not within my scope of practice. I can, however, recommend a therapist who specializes in stress management and coping mechanisms. Would you be interested in a referral?
PATIENT: Therapist? You want to send me to a therapist? Now you’re being ridiculous! I just want a simple card! I come to a doctor, a professional, and you want to send me to talk about my feelings? This is… insulting! I came here for morale support, not… an intervention! A card is all I’m asking for. It's a matter of principle now!
DOCTOR: Mr. Kammer, I'm afraid this conversation is unproductive. I have other patients waiting who require legitimate medical attention. I can document your stress and anxiety as a concern, but I will not be providing a card. If you feel your condition is worsening, I suggest you seek mental health support. Here is a list of local therapists. Good day.
