DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Meigs, good to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor Fourney. It's nice to meet you too. Well, my back... it's been really bad. Hurts a lot. It's been getting worse for maybe a week now, I think. It's hard to say exactly, time kinda runs together sometimes. But it’s bad enough I had trouble getting here today.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Okay, “bad” is a bit vague. Can you be a little more specific?
PATIENT: Okay, okay. Sorry. It’s like… a sharp pain. Right in my lower back. And it goes down my leg sometimes, the left one. Not all the way to my foot, but pretty far. It’s worse when I try to stand up, or bend over. Even just sitting for too long makes it ache. Does that make sense? It’s not like a constant pain, it comes and goes, but when it comes it really hurts.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s helpful. So sharp pain in the lower back radiating down the left leg, worse with standing and bending, and comes and goes. Have you noticed anything that makes it better?
PATIENT: Um… let me think. Lying down flat, that helps some. And… warm water. A warm shower kinda eases it for a little while. But not for long. And honestly, not much else. I tried some of those over-the-counter pain pills, the ones you take for headaches, but they don't really do much for this pain. It’s different.
DOCTOR: Okay. And have you had any trouble with your bladder or bowels?
PATIENT: Oh, no, not really. Everything is... normal there. No changes. Except, maybe... it's a little harder to get comfortable when I need to go. But nothing wrong, you know? Just… awkward. Is that what you're asking about?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s exactly what I was asking. Good to know it’s not a significant change. Now, have you had any injuries to your back recently?
PATIENT: No, no injuries. Not that I remember, anyway. I haven’t fallen or anything. It just… started. That’s what’s worrying me. I mean, I do have the cancer, and I'm worried it's... I don't know... spreadin'? Is that a thing? It hurts different than before.
DOCTOR: Okay. You're understandably concerned about your cancer. We'll absolutely keep that in mind. But back pain is common, and often not related to cancer, even in patients with a history of it. Let's not jump to conclusions. Now, can you tell me a little more about the cancer?
PATIENT: It's in my lung. They found it… oh, about two years ago now. I had some coughing, and they did a scan. It's… it's not the best kind, I don't remember the name. They did some treatments, chemo mostly. It shrunk it a lot, but it never went away completely. I see Doctor Ramirez for that, he's good. I've been doing okay for a while, mostly. That’s why this back pain is so scary. It feels… different than just being tired from the treatments, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, lung cancer, treated with chemotherapy, and you're followed by Dr. Ramirez. And this pain feels different from what you've experienced with the cancer treatments. That’s important information. Now, let's talk about your medical history in general. Any other medical problems I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Um… let me think. I have high blood pressure, Doctor Ramirez checks that every time I see him. And… sometimes my ankles swell up. Nothing major, but it happens. Oh! And I had my gallbladder taken out a long time ago. I think it was… maybe 15 years now? I don't really remember much about it. Does that help? I try not to worry about too much, if that makes sense. It's easier that way.
DOCTOR: Alright, high blood pressure, ankle swelling, gallbladder removal 15 years ago. I understand wanting to take things easy. Now, are you currently taking any medications for your blood pressure or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh yes! I take a pill for the blood pressure. It's… a white one. Let me see... it says Lisinopril, 20 milligrams. I take one every morning. And sometimes, when my ankles are really swollen, Doctor Ramirez tells me to take a water pill, too. That one’s yellow. I don't take that one all the time, just when I need to. Is that enough information? I'm sorry, I'm not very good at remembering these things.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly fine. Lisinopril 20mg daily, and a water pill as needed for swelling. Now, any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, no allergies. Not that I know of, anyway. Doctor Ramirez checked that when I started the chemo, and he said I was good. I haven't had any reactions to any medicines, ever. I’m pretty lucky that way, I guess. Just... this back pain is worrying me a lot. Is it possible it's the cancer? I keep thinking about it.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. Let’s try to remain calm. As I said, it could be related to your cancer, but there are many other possibilities. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. Just to get a better idea of what's going on. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that's okay. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just want to know what's causing the pain. If it is the cancer, I want to know. And if it's not… that would be good too. Just please, can we figure it out? I’m tired of worrying.
DOCTOR: Okay. Alright. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Then I’ll check your reflexes, strength, and sensation in your legs. And finally, I’ll do some movements to see if I can pinpoint where the pain is coming from. Please let me know immediately if anything causes significant discomfort. Take a deep breath for me… and again… Good. Lungs sound clear, no wheezing or crackles. Now, can you bend your knees and point your toes?
PATIENT: Like this? It doesn’t hurt to do it, but my leg feels kinda… tight. And that lower back is still achin’. Not sharp, just a dull ache. It’s hard to explain. It feels like everything is pulled, you know? Does that make sense? I’m trying to do what you ask, but it's not easy.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes sense. Okay, I'm feeling some muscle tightness here on your left side. Now, I'm going to lift your leg straight up. Please let me know if this causes any pain to radiate down your leg. Relax your leg as much as possible. How does that feel?
PATIENT: Ooh, yes! That's it. That's the pain. It shoots down my leg, just like when I stand up. Not all the way to my foot, but pretty far. It’s a sharp, burning pain. It's not terrible, but I definitely feel it. Please stop, that's enough. That's the pain, Doctor. That’s the one I've been trying to tell you about.
DOCTOR: Okay. Alright, that test is positive, which suggests possible irritation of the sciatic nerve. Your range of motion is somewhat limited due to the pain. I also notice some tenderness in the muscles on the left side of your lower back. Based on this exam, it sounds like you have a lumbar radiculopathy, which means a pinched nerve in your lower back is causing the pain to radiate down your leg. It's likely related to muscle spasms and inflammation. While we can't rule out the cancer as a potential cause without further testing, this presentation is more consistent with a mechanical issue. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: A pinched nerve? Okay. So, it’s not… necessarily the cancer spreadin'? That’s a relief. But... what does “mechanical issue” mean? And what do we do about a pinched nerve? Will it go away on its own? I'm sorry, I’m probably asking a lot of questions. It’s just… this pain is really scary, and I want to understand what’s happening. And what kind of testing do we need to do to be sure about the cancer?
DOCTOR: No, you're not asking too many questions at all. It’s good to be informed. “Mechanical issue” just means it’s related to the structures in your back – muscles, nerves, discs – and not necessarily a tumor. It’s often caused by a muscle spasm, a slight bulge in a disc, or inflammation putting pressure on the nerve. Whether it goes away on its own depends on the severity. Often, it improves with conservative treatment like physical therapy and pain management. However, to rule out other causes, including the possibility of the cancer being involved, I’d like to order an MRI of your lumbar spine. This will give us a detailed picture of the structures in your back and help us identify the source of the pain. Do you have any allergies to contrast dye?
PATIENT: No, no allergies to anything. Doctor Ramirez did a lot of scans when I was first diagnosed, and I never had any problems with the dye. An MRI sounds… good. I want to know what’s going on. How long will it take to get the results? And will I have to do anything special to prepare for it? I’m a little nervous about being in that machine, I’ve heard it’s loud and claustrophobic. Is it safe?
DOCTOR: Good. No allergies to contrast dye is helpful. An MRI is generally safe, but I understand your concerns about it being loud and claustrophobic. We can discuss options for managing anxiety if that's a concern, such as medication or an open MRI if available. As for preparation, you’ll need to remove any metal objects before the scan, like jewelry or clothing with metal fasteners. The technologist will give you specific instructions before the procedure. It usually takes about 30-60 minutes to complete the scan, and the results will typically be available within a few days. Once I have the results, we can discuss them in detail and create a treatment plan tailored to your needs. In the meantime, I'm going to prescribe you a muscle relaxant and a mild pain reliever to help manage your symptoms. And I'd like you to schedule a consultation with physical therapy. They can teach you exercises to strengthen your back muscles and improve your posture. Does that sound like a reasonable plan?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good. A muscle relaxant and pain reliever would be great. And physical therapy makes sense, if it can help strengthen my back. I’m glad we’re doing something. I just want to feel better. Will the insurance cover the physical therapy? I don’t want to worry about the cost too much. And when should I call to schedule the MRI?
DOCTOR: Excellent. I’ll send the prescriptions electronically to your pharmacy. As for the physical therapy, it should be covered by your insurance, but it’s always best to verify with your insurance provider beforehand to confirm your coverage and any potential out-of-pocket costs. I can have my staff assist you with that, if you’d like. As for the MRI, I’ll have my scheduling department contact you directly to arrange an appointment. They will coordinate with the imaging center and ensure everything is set up correctly. They'll also confirm any pre-authorization requirements with your insurance. Do you have any other questions or concerns at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything for now. Thank you, Doctor Fourney. You explained everything very clearly, and I feel a lot better knowing we have a plan. It’s just… a relief to finally be doing something about this pain. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Meigs. I’m glad I could help. Don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. I’ll follow up with you once the MRI results are available. Get some rest, and try to avoid any activities that aggravate your pain. And please, don’t hesitate to reach out. We’re here to help. Have a good day. .
