DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Espinueva. I'm Dr. Pipkorn. Welcome to the clinic. Now, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. Well, it’s this pain in my side that keeps coming back. And… the waterworks trouble, if you know what I mean. It’s been happening on and off for a while now, and it’s getting a bit tiresome, to be honest.
DOCTOR: "Pain in your side, and some difficulty with urination. Alright. Let’s start with the pain. Can you describe it for me?
PATIENT: Hmm. It’s a dull ache, mostly. Not sharp, not like a sudden injury. It's on my right side, just below my ribs, I think. Sometimes it feels like it goes around to my back a little. And it comes and goes… some days I barely notice it, other days it’s… well, it’s just there, nagging at me. It doesn’t keep me up at night, but it's definitely bothersome.
DOCTOR: "And how long has this been going on, this 'nagging' pain?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That's a good question. It feels like… years, really. But I suppose the last year or so it’s been more frequent. Before that, it would just come and go, maybe once or twice a year. But now… it’s almost every few weeks, if not more often. I'm not very good with remembering dates, I'm afraid. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: "Years, with increasing frequency over the last year. That's… less than ideal. And you mentioned 'waterworks trouble'. Could you elaborate on that?
PATIENT: Yes, well… I have to go to the bathroom a lot. More often than I used to, that is. And sometimes… it burns when I go. It’s not every time, but often enough to be a nuisance. And sometimes, I feel like I haven't quite emptied my bladder, even after I’ve just been. It's just… uncomfortable, really. I try to drink plenty of water, but it doesn’t seem to make much difference.
DOCTOR: "Frequent urination, burning sensation, and a feeling of incomplete emptying. Alright. Now, let's move on to some general questions. Do you have any fevers, chills, or nausea accompanying this pain or urinary trouble?
PATIENT: No, thankfully. No fevers, no chills. And I haven’t been sick to my stomach, no. Just the pain and the… bother with my bladder. I do get a little tired sometimes, but I put that down to getting older, if you know what I mean. I haven’t noticed anything else particularly worrying, thankfully.
DOCTOR: "Getting older, yes. Of course. Now, have you had any changes in your appetite, or noticed any weight loss recently?
PATIENT: No, my appetite is pretty much the same, I think. I enjoy my food, and I eat fairly well. And I don’t think I've lost any weight. If anything, I might have put a little on, to be honest! I try to have a good breakfast, and a nice dinner. I don’t bother with much in between, really.
DOCTOR: “Alright. And are you currently taking any medications, Mr. Espinueva?
PATIENT: Just what the doctor prescribes when I need it, you know? Nothing regularly. I take a tablet for my blood pressure sometimes, if it gets a bit high. But that’s it, really. And I haven’t taken anything for the pain or the… waterworks trouble, because I hoped it would just go away on its own. Perhaps I should have seen someone sooner.
DOCTOR: “And do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else, as far as you know?
PATIENT: No, not that I'm aware of. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything. My wife used to keep track of things like that, but she’s… well, she’s not with us anymore. So, I haven't really thought about it in years, to be honest. I eat most things, and haven’t had any trouble with any medicines the doctor’s given me in the past.
DOCTOR: “Very well. Now, I’d like to perform a brief physical examination. I’ll need you to lie down on the examination table. We'll start by listening to your abdomen and checking for any tenderness. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine, Doctor. Perfectly alright. I suppose it’s best to get to the bottom of things, isn’t it? Just let me know if it’s going to be… uncomfortable. I’m not as sprightly as I used to be!
DOCTOR: “Of course. I’ll be as gentle as possible. Please lie on your back, and I’ll begin. Now, I’m going to listen to your abdomen with this stethoscope. Just breathe normally. Normal bowel sounds… a little diminished, but not alarming. Any tenderness here?
PATIENT: Ooh, yes. A little bit there. On my right side, just below my ribs. Like you said. Not a sharp pain, just… uncomfortable. Is that what you’re looking for? It’s a bit tender there, definitely.
DOCTOR: “Yes, that’s what I’m looking for. Tenderness in the right upper quadrant… and it seems to be localized. And here?
PATIENT: Yes, a bit there too. More of a dull ache, really. It’s… hard to describe. It’s not like a bruise, but it feels… sensitive. It’s the same area where the pain usually is, just… a bit more noticeable when you press on it. I suppose it doesn’t surprise me, does it? It's always been sore there when it flares up.
DOCTOR: “Localized tenderness in the right upper quadrant and flank… consistent with your reported pain. Alright. And now, I’m going to gently palpate your kidneys. Just let me know if this causes any discomfort. Any pain there?
PATIENT: Ooh, yes. That’s… not very comfortable. A bit of a dull ache, definitely. It’s not a sharp pain, but I can feel it. It’s… deep inside, I think. Not on the surface, but… where your kidneys are supposed to be. It’s not unbearable, but I can certainly feel it.
DOCTOR: “Alright. That’s sufficient for now. Based on what you’ve told me and the examination, there are a few possibilities we need to investigate. It could be something as simple as musculoskeletal pain, but given the tenderness over your kidney area and your urinary symptoms, we need to rule out a kidney infection or something more serious like gallstones. I’m going to order a complete blood count, a urinalysis, and an abdominal ultrasound. This will give us a clearer picture of what's going on. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Oh my. That sounds… thorough. Yes, I understand. Blood tests, water test… and something with the tummy. It sounds a bit worrying, if I'm honest. But I suppose it's best to know, isn't it? Is it… is it serious, Doctor?
DOCTOR: “Mr. Espinueva, it’s far too early to jump to any conclusions. These tests are simply to gather information. Most likely, it's something manageable. However, it's important to rule out anything serious. I'll explain the process. The blood test will check for signs of infection. The urinalysis will check for bacteria in your urine. And the ultrasound will allow us to visualize your kidneys, gallbladder, and liver. The lab technician will take the blood sample. The ultrasound is painless. Do you have any questions about the tests themselves?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. They sound… straightforward enough. Blood, water… picture of my insides. Yes. So, where do I go for these tests? And… how long will it take to get the results? I haven't got much energy for multiple trips if I can avoid it.
DOCTOR: “You’ll need to go to the lab at Rural General Hospital. I'm printing out a requisition form now with the specific tests and instructions. They can usually take the blood and urine samples at the same visit. The ultrasound will require a separate appointment, which I will schedule for you at the hospital radiology department. It’s usually within the week, but I’ll need to confirm availability. You’ll receive a call with the appointment time. The results typically take 24-48 hours, so you should have them by the end of the week. Once I have the results, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and determine the best course of action. Do you have any difficulty getting transportation to the hospital?
PATIENT: No, thankfully. My neighbour, Mr. Jones, he’s a good man. He usually takes me to appointments when I need it. He’s got a nice car, and he doesn’t mind a bit of a drive. I'm very grateful for him. So, transportation isn’t a problem. 24 to 48 hours, you say? That’s… manageable. And I just wait for a phone call?
DOCTOR: “Yes, you’ll receive a phone call with the results and to schedule a follow-up appointment. In the meantime, if you develop a fever, chills, severe back pain, or any difficulty breathing, please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Fever, chills, bad back pain… emergency room. I understand. Right. Well, thank you for your time, Doctor Pipkorn. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me, and for getting these tests arranged. Hopefully, it's nothing too serious.
DOCTOR: “Very well. I’ll be in touch as soon as the results are available. Try not to worry unnecessarily. You may go now.
