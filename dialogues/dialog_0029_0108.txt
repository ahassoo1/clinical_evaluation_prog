DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Gentz. I'm Dr. Chora. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Look, Doc, it’s…well, it’s blood. Coming up, you know? Not a good thing, is it? Happened a couple times now. Thought I’d get it checked before it gets…messy. Honestly, I don’t even know why I’m here. Shoulda just stayed home, probably.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Blood coming up… can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: More about it? What is there to tell? It’s blood, Doc! Bright red, mostly. Not…chunky, if that makes sense. Just…there. Like someone turned on a faucet. Happens after I eat, usually. Not every time, mind you. And not a whole lot, but enough to worry a man. I used to be a strong guy, you know? This ain't right.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, bright red blood after you eat, not every time, and not a large amount. Okay. And how long has this been happening?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think…It started…maybe three, four weeks ago? Hard to say exactly. I don’t really keep track of things like that. It was just a little bit at first, figured it was something I ate. You know? Bad shrimp or something. But it’s happened a few more times since then, so…figured I should get someone to look at it. It’s just…troubling, you know? And my wife…well, she’d want me to get it checked.
DOCTOR: Okay, three or four weeks, intermittent. And you mentioned it happens after you eat. Does it happen with everything you eat, or are there certain foods that seem to trigger it more often?
PATIENT: Nah, not everything. Steak, usually. Big juicy steaks. Iron, right? Always told me iron’s good for ya. And…spicy stuff. Anything with a kick. I like a little heat, you know? But it doesn’t happen every time I eat those things. Like last week, had a ribeye, felt fine. Then the night before last, a little bit of chili and…bam. There it was. Makes no sense.
DOCTOR: Alright, so steak and spicy foods seem to be associated with it, but not consistently. Okay. Have you noticed any other symptoms at all?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Like what? Stomach’s been…grumbly, I guess. But I always get a little grumbly after I eat. I’m a big guy, need a lot of fuel, you know? And…tired. Real tired lately. But honestly, Doc, I’m 51. What 51-year-old isn’t tired? Could be anything. Or nothing. Honestly, I feel like I'm wasting your time.
DOCTOR: No, you're not wasting my time. Okay, so grumbling stomach and fatigue. Have you noticed any change in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Bowel habits? You mean…going to the bathroom? Look, Doc, I don't really wanna talk about that with a stranger. Is this really necessary? I told you I was throwing up blood. Seems like that should be the focus, don't you think? Honestly, this is getting…uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: I understand your discomfort, Mr. Gentz. And I apologize if I’m asking personal questions. But changes in bowel habits can be related to the bleeding, so it’s important for me to ask. But let's skip that for now. Have you experienced any weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Weight loss? Hmm. Now that you mention it… yeah, maybe a little. My pants feel a little looser than they used to. But I haven’t exactly been hitting the gym, if that’s what you’re thinking. Could just be the summer heat, you know? Everything shrinks in this weather. I’m a big guy, weight fluctuates. I wouldn’t worry about it.
DOCTOR: Okay. And have you ever had any problems with heartburn, indigestion, or ulcers?
PATIENT: Ulcers? Good lord, no. Never had nothing like that. My father had a touch of heartburn when he got older, but I’ve always been able to eat whatever I want. Strong stomach, I always figured. A little spicy food never bothered me. This whole thing… it just doesn’t make any sense. And frankly, Doc, you’re starting to sound like one of those doctors on TV. All these questions...
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Gentz. I apologize if I'm coming across that way. I just want to get a complete picture. Okay, one last question for now. Are you currently taking any medications, or do you have any allergies?
PATIENT: Medications? Nah. Don’t take nothing. Never needed to. Allergies… dust, maybe. Gets my nose itchy. That’s about it. I’m a simple man, Doc. I eat, I sleep, I work. Don’t need a lot of fancy pills. Look, can we just figure out what’s causing the blood? This is… upsetting.
DOCTOR: Okay. Alright. Well, Mr. Gentz, given your symptoms – the bright red blood after eating steak and spicy foods, along with the fatigue and possible weight loss – there are a few possibilities we need to investigate. The most likely, based on what you’ve told me, is some sort of upper gastrointestinal issue. That could be anything from a minor irritation in your esophagus to a more serious problem like an ulcer or a lesion in your stomach or duodenum. I'd like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. Then, I'm going to order a complete blood count and a stool test to check for blood. After that, we'll need to do an endoscopy – that's where we insert a small camera down your throat to take a look at your esophagus, stomach, and duodenum. It’s the best way to get a definitive diagnosis. Does that sound acceptable to you?
PATIENT: An endoscopy? You want to shove a camera down my throat? Look, Doc, I came in here because I’m throwing up blood, not because I wanna be a tourist in my own stomach. Is that really necessary? I mean, can’t we just… try something else? Maybe some pills or something? Honestly, this sounds awful. And expensive, I bet. I don’t even have insurance.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Mr. Gentz. It’s not a pleasant thought, I agree. And you’re right to be concerned about the cost. But unfortunately, without a proper look inside your upper GI tract, it's difficult to know why you're bleeding. Pills can mask the symptoms, but they won’t address the underlying cause. And yes, it can be expensive, but we can discuss options for financial assistance or payment plans with the hospital billing department. We need to rule out anything serious, and the endoscopy is the most reliable way to do that. If it turns out to be something minor, we can address it quickly and effectively. If it’s something more serious, early detection is crucial. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding spicy foods and large, heavy meals, especially steak, to see if that reduces the bleeding. Let’s start with the physical exam, and then we can talk about the next steps. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Fine. Do your…exam. But I'm telling you, Doc, this is a waste of my time. And probably a lot of money. But… alright. Just get it over with. I don't want to spend all day in here. And please, no lectures about my diet. I know what I'm doing.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Gentz. I understand your frustration, and I’ll keep it as brief and efficient as possible. If you could just lie down on the table, please. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, and then I'll palpate your abdomen. Your heart sounds regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear. Any tenderness here?
PATIENT: Ouch. Yeah, a little. Right…there. Not a sharp pain, just… uncomfortable. Like a dull ache. It's been like that for a few days, now that I think about it. Not enough to bother me too much, just…there. Always thought it was just gas. Or maybe something I ate.
DOCTOR: Okay. And how about here?
PATIENT: Yeah, still tender. It's…lower down, on the right side. Not excruciating, but definitely not comfortable. It feels…swollen, maybe? I don't know. Like something’s pushing out. Honestly, Doc, this isn't looking good, is it? I can tell by your face.
DOCTOR: Alright. Based on the tenderness in your lower right abdomen, combined with the bleeding and fatigue, there's a possibility this could be more than just a simple GI irritation. While I don’t want to jump to conclusions, it could indicate a potential issue with your liver or gallbladder. It's difficult to say for sure without further testing. The endoscopy will help us rule out issues in the upper GI tract. However, I also want to order a complete metabolic panel and a liver function test to assess your liver and kidney function, and an abdominal ultrasound to get a better look at your liver, gallbladder, and pancreas. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Ultrasound? Liver? Pancreas? Doc, you're starting to scare me. I just came in here because I threw up some blood. Now you're talking about organs I didn't even know I had. Look, is this gonna be expensive? Because I'm telling you, I don't have the money for a whole battery of tests. I'm a simple man. I work. I eat. Now I'm apparently falling apart on the inside.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Gentz. I apologize if I’m overwhelming you with information. I’m not trying to scare you, but it’s important to be thorough, especially given your symptoms. The ultrasound isn't as expensive as some of the other tests, and it can give us a lot of valuable information. The complete metabolic panel and liver function tests are relatively inexpensive blood tests. Let me see if I can find some resources for financial assistance programs. Many hospitals have programs to help patients who are uninsured or underinsured. We can also discuss a payment plan with the billing department. In the meantime, let's focus on getting these tests scheduled. We'll start with the blood work and the ultrasound. Once we have the results, we can determine the next steps. Does that sound like a plan?
PATIENT: Fine. Just… get it over with. Do what you gotta do. But if this ends up costing me my house, I’m blaming you, Doc. And honestly? I’m starting to regret even coming in here. Maybe I shoulda just stayed home and suffered. At least I wouldn’t be broke and sick.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Gentz. And I assure you, I will do everything I can to keep the costs as low as possible. I'll also make sure to explain all the results to you clearly and answer any questions you have. We'll get through this together. Alright, I’m going to write up the orders for the blood work and the ultrasound. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood. Once that’s done, she’ll schedule the ultrasound for you. In the meantime, avoid alcohol and fatty foods, and try to stay hydrated. If you experience any severe pain, fever, or vomiting, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me before I leave?
PATIENT: No. Just… get it over with. I don’t want to talk about it anymore. I just want to go home. And… thanks. I guess. Even though I'm probably gonna end up bankrupt. Just… thanks for trying.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Gentz. I'll leave you to rest. The nurse will be in shortly. Please don't hesitate to call if you need anything. And Mr. Gentz?
PATIENT: What?
DOCTOR: Don’t lose hope. We’ll figure this out. .
PATIENT: .
