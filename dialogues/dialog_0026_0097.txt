DOCTOR: Good morning, Marija. It's nice to meet you. I'm Dr. Finco. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… adequate to meet you as well. My husband suggested I come. He’s become rather insistent on this… “planning ahead” business. He says I need to fill out some forms, in case… well, you know. Something about making sure my wishes are known. I confess, I find the whole thing a bit morbid, but he’s quite persistent. I believe he called it an Advance Directive or a POLST form? I'm not entirely sure what either of those are, precisely.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s perfectly alright. It is a bit daunting to think about these things, and your husband is very wise to encourage you to consider it. An Advance Directive – sometimes called a living will – outlines your wishes for medical care if you were unable to speak for yourself. A POLST form – that’s Physician Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment – is a more specific set of instructions for immediate medical decisions. It sounds like he’s concerned about being prepared, which is very thoughtful. Before we get into the specifics of those forms, though, is there anything currently bothering you?
PATIENT: Currently? No, nothing of any real concern. A bit of stiffness in my knees, perhaps, but that's simply age, I assure you. I remain quite active, despite everything. I teach literature, you see. One must be able to stand to lecture, naturally. And frankly, Doctor, I find it rather… unsettling that you’re asking about my physical ailments when my husband brought me here for… future hypotheticals. Is this standard procedure? I was under the impression we would be discussing these forms directly.
DOCTOR: You’re absolutely right to question that, Marija. My apologies. It is standard procedure for me to get a general sense of your overall health, even when the primary concern is planning ahead. It helps me understand the context of any wishes you might have. It's just a quick check-in. We can absolutely focus on the Advance Directive and POLST form if you prefer. But knowing a bit about your current health – even something like the stiffness in your knees – can be helpful. It doesn’t change anything about discussing your future wishes, it just… gives me a more complete picture. Would you mind if I ask a few quick questions about your general health, and then we can move straight to the forms?
PATIENT: Very well. But please, be brief. I haven't the patience for a lengthy examination. And do refrain from asking about… trivial matters. I assure you, my diet is perfectly adequate and I get sufficient sleep when my husband allows it. Ask your questions, Doctor, and let us be done with this.
DOCTOR: Of course. I’ll be as brief as possible, and I certainly won’t pry into trivial matters. First, have you been experiencing any pain anywhere else besides your knees?
PATIENT: No. Just the knees, occasionally. It's hardly debilitating. More of an annoyance, really. I can manage it with a bit of… willpower, and the occasional warm bath. Honestly, Doctor, I suspect it's simply the weather. We’ve had a particularly damp summer.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any changes in your energy levels recently?
PATIENT: Changes? Well… one always feels a little more tired as one ages, doesn’t one? But no, nothing drastic. I continue to grade papers, attend faculty meetings, and maintain a perfectly civilized household. My husband, of course, believes I overexert myself. He’s forever telling me to “rest.” It’s quite tiresome, frankly. Are we getting anywhere with this, Doctor? I truly would prefer to discuss these… forms. It seems a rather inefficient use of my time to detail the mundane aspects of my existence.
DOCTOR: Yes, we are. I apologize for the delay in getting to the forms. It’s just that I want to be sure I have a complete picture. Before we move on, could you tell me a little about any medical conditions you have been diagnosed with in the past?
PATIENT: Medical conditions? Really, Doctor? Are we seriously cataloging my entire medical history now? I had a rather unpleasant bout of bronchitis when I was teaching in Morocco, decades ago. And a minor fracture in my wrist as a child, attempting to climb a fig tree. Beyond that… nothing of any consequence. I assure you, I am a remarkably healthy woman for my age. My husband, of course, will likely recall a multitude of trivial ailments, but I assure you, they are largely exaggerated. Is this necessary?
DOCTOR: You are right to question it. We don't need a complete, exhaustive list. The bronchitis is good to know, thank you. And the wrist fracture, just for completeness. To be sure, have you ever been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Hospitalized? Once. For the bronchitis. It was quite unpleasant, the air conditioning was atrocious. And the food… simply dreadful. A truly barbaric experience. It was many years ago, of course. I’ve avoided hospitals diligently ever since. Honestly, Doctor, I fail to see the relevance of these questions. Are we attempting to establish whether I am prone to… dramatics? Because I assure you, I am perfectly capable of rational thought. Let us move on to these forms. My husband is waiting, and I have a rather substantial pile of student papers awaiting my attention.
DOCTOR: You are absolutely right. My apologies. I am being unnecessarily thorough. Let’s move on to the Advance Directive then. Essentially, it allows you to make decisions about your medical care if you were unable to speak for yourself. It covers things like whether you want life-sustaining treatments, such as a ventilator or feeding tube. Are you familiar with those concepts at all?
PATIENT: Ventilators and feeding tubes… vaguely. I recall reading something about them in a rather sensationalist novel, years ago. They sounded… unpleasant. And rather undignified. Frankly, Doctor, the thought of being kept alive artificially, in such a state… it’s appalling. I would prefer a swift and natural end, if such a thing were to occur. I assume these forms allow me to specify that? My husband has been quite insistent on ensuring my “wishes are known,” as he puts it. He’s a very practical man, though rather prone to… morbid thoughts, if I may say so. Just tell me what needs to be signed. I haven’t the patience for lengthy explanations.
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely. This form allows you to specify exactly that. It includes a section where you can state your preferences regarding life-sustaining treatments. You can choose to accept them, refuse them, or specify under what circumstances you would want them. We'll go through it section by section, and I'll explain each option. There's no pressure to make any decisions right away. We can take as much time as you need. First, there’s a section to appoint a healthcare proxy. This is the person you trust to make decisions on your behalf if you are unable to do so yourself. Do you have someone in mind for that role?
PATIENT: My husband, naturally. Who else would it be? He's… perfectly capable of making rational decisions, even if he does occasionally indulge in these… gloomy speculations. He’s a retired engineer, very organized and… thorough. He's already given it considerable thought, I assure you. He likely has a list of preferred hospitals and… emergency contacts prepared. Just tell me where to sign. I confess, I find the entire process rather… demeaning. A perfectly healthy woman, forced to contemplate her own mortality. It’s simply dreadful.
DOCTOR: Very well. Here, simply sign your name and date. And here, is a section for your husband’s contact information. He’ll need to sign as well, acknowledging his role as your healthcare proxy. Excellent. Now, the next section concerns your preferences for medical treatment. It asks about things like CPR, mechanical ventilation, and artificial nutrition. Do you have any specific wishes regarding those treatments?
PATIENT: CPR… I suppose that’s acceptable. One shouldn’t object to being… revived, should the need arise. Mechanical ventilation and artificial nutrition… absolutely not. I have no desire to be kept alive by machines. It’s undignified, barbaric, and frankly, a waste of resources. I would prefer a natural end, with dignity and… peace. Is there a box I can check to indicate that? I want it explicitly stated. No machines. No tubes. A swift and natural end. Is that clear enough? My husband understands my wishes perfectly. He'll be able to explain it, if necessary. Just point me to the appropriate boxes. I haven’t all day, you know.
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely. Here, you can check the box to indicate that you do not want CPR. And here, you can check the boxes to indicate that you do not want mechanical ventilation or artificial nutrition. Excellent. That clearly states your wishes. Do you want to add any further clarification?
PATIENT: Yes. Add a note. State that I wish to be kept comfortable, with pain management if necessary. And that I do not wish to be resuscitated under any circumstances, regardless of my condition. No heroics. No prolonged suffering. A swift and peaceful end. And… add that my husband has my full authority to make any decisions on my behalf, in accordance with my wishes. He understands me perfectly. Can you do that? Is that clear enough? Honestly, Doctor, I find this entire process rather… exhausting. A perfectly healthy woman, forced to contemplate her own demise. It’s simply dreadful. Now, is there anything else? I truly must get back to my papers.
DOCTOR: Yes, I’ve added a note documenting your wishes for comfort care and that your husband has full authority to make decisions on your behalf. It states: “Patient wishes for comfort care only, and does not wish to be resuscitated under any circumstances. Husband has full authority to make decisions on her behalf, in accordance with her wishes.” Here you are. This is the completed Advance Directive. Please read it over carefully to ensure everything is accurate. Your husband will also need to sign it as a witness. Do you have any questions about anything we’ve discussed today?
PATIENT: No. It seems… adequate. As long as my wishes are clearly stated, and my husband is authorized to make decisions, I suppose it will suffice. Honestly, Doctor, I’m relieved this is over. It was a rather unpleasant experience, but I suppose it was necessary. Thank you for your… assistance. I believe that concludes everything. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I truly must get back to my papers. I have a mountain of student essays awaiting my attention. .
DOCTOR: It was a pleasure meeting you, Marija. And you’re very welcome. Please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any questions or concerns in the future. And thank you for trusting me with your wishes. Have a good day, and I hope you enjoy grading your papers.
