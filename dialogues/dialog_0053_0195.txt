DOCTOR: Right, Janeth Micucci. Sixty years old. Good morning. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you. It’s just… well, I’ve been feeling a bit low, you see. Not sick sick, but… just needing a little… boost. I thought maybe a nice card from the doctor would do the trick. You know, one of those “Get Well Soon” things. It's the thought that counts, really. My husband thinks I’m silly, but he doesn’t understand these things.
DOCTOR: A… card, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, a card! Honestly, it’s just… sometimes a little encouragement goes a long way. I’m not asking for pills or anything, just a kind word in writing. Is that so much to ask? I mean, you are a doctor. You’re supposed to make people feel better, aren’t you? A card would be lovely. A pretty one, if you have them.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, Mrs. Micucci, while I appreciate you coming in, my role as a physician is to assess and address medical concerns. A “get well” card isn’t… standard practice. But, let’s try to understand what’s been making you feel “low,” as you put it. Could you tell me more about how you’ve been feeling?
PATIENT: Oh, standard practice. Always with the “standard practice.” Honestly! Well… it’s just… everything feels a bit… grey, you know? Not actively wrong, but not bright and cheerful either. I don't sleep as well as I used to, and I don't have the energy I once did. My daughter keeps telling me I need to “find a hobby,” but really, what’s the point? It’s not like anything’s going to happen. And my neighbor’s cat keeps staring at me. It’s unsettling, honestly. Is that… is that something you treat? Unsettling cats?
DOCTOR: Right. Okay. So, you're feeling fatigued, having trouble sleeping, and generally experiencing a lack of motivation. And… a concerning cat. Let's focus on the first part. When did you first start noticing these feelings?
PATIENT: Oh, it's been… well, it’s hard to say exactly. Probably since the weather turned, to be honest. All that rain. It gets right into your bones. But it's been getting worse lately. My husband keeps saying I’m just getting old, but I’m not that old. I still make a perfectly good dal bhat, you know. And I keep the house tidy. It’s just… everything feels like effort. And I keep forgetting where I put my glasses. Though, I had them just now, didn’t I? See? Perfectly fine. Mostly.
DOCTOR: Okay. So fatigue and difficulty sleeping, possibly worsening recently. And you've mentioned some forgetfulness. Has this forgetfulness been interfering with your daily life—like, missing appointments or struggling to remember important things?
PATIENT: Well, not appointments, exactly. I always remember my appointments. Though I did forget my niece’s birthday last month. She wasn't pleased. And sometimes I have trouble recalling the names of… well, people I’ve just met. Or the name of that nice actor, you know, the one who’s always in those adventure films. My husband knows all their names. It’s terribly frustrating. He just says I’m being dramatic. Men. Honestly. It's not that dramatic to forget a name. Is forgetting names a sign of something terrible? I don't want to end up… you know… like my aunt. She didn’t recognize anyone at the end. It was awful. Though, she did have a very poor diet. I eat plenty of vegetables.
DOCTOR: Right. We'll address your concerns, Mrs. Micucci. It's good that you're aware of these changes and are seeking help. It's important to rule out any underlying medical causes for the fatigue, sleep disturbance, and memory concerns. Have you experienced any other symptoms—like changes in appetite, weight loss, headaches, dizziness, or any difficulties with vision or balance?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, let me think. My appetite hasn’t been fantastic, no. I don’t really feel hungry, not like I used to. I haven't weighed myself lately, but my clothes probably fit a little looser. And sometimes I get a bit… wobbly, you know? Just when I stand up quickly. Not all the time, just sometimes. And I’ve been having these little… twinges in my hands. Not pain, exactly, but… uncomfortable. And my neighbor keeps leaving me zucchini. I don’t even like zucchini! It’s all very unsettling. Does that count as a symptom? Unwanted zucchini?
DOCTOR: Okay. So, decreased appetite, possible weight loss, occasional dizziness upon standing, twinges in your hands, and… unwanted zucchini. Thank you for sharing all of this. Now, I'd like to ask about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past, such as high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see… I had a bit of trouble with my blood pressure years ago, but the doctor said it was just stress. And my mother had something with her joints, I think. Arthritis, maybe? It was very painful for her. And I had a bad fall when I was younger, broke my arm. But other than that, nothing much. I’ve always been a fairly healthy person, really. I eat my vegetables, I don’t smoke, I don’t drink much. Except for a little raksi at festivals, but that's good for the soul, you know? My husband says it's terrible for my liver. He worries too much. And I've never had any surgeries. Though, I did have my tonsils out when I was a child. Does that count? It was a very long time ago. And I’ve had all my vaccinations. Mostly. I think.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, a history of high blood pressure, a family history of arthritis, childhood broken arm and tonsillectomy, and generally good health otherwise. Let's talk about medications. Are you currently taking any prescription or over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, no, not really. I don’t like taking pills. I did try some of those sleep aids my daughter gave me, but they made me feel dreadful in the morning. So I stopped taking those. And sometimes I take a little turmeric for my joints, but that’s just a home remedy, you know? Nothing serious. I prefer to let my body heal itself. My husband keeps offering me these little fish oil capsules, but I haven’t gotten around to trying them yet. He thinks they’re good for everything. Honestly, men and their pills! It's all very… unsettling. Is it unsettling to be offered too many pills? I think it is. It makes me feel like something is wrong with me. And I don’t want something to be wrong with me. I just want to feel a little bit better, and maybe get a nice card from the doctor. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: Mrs. Micucci, I understand your concerns and your desire to feel better. And while a kind gesture is always appreciated, my primary responsibility is to assess your health and identify any potential medical issues. Right now, you're describing a number of symptoms – fatigue, sleep disturbance, memory concerns, decreased appetite, occasional dizziness, hand twinges – and it’s important we investigate these properly. I'm going to conduct a physical examination to get a better understanding of what's going on. This will involve checking your blood pressure, listening to your heart and lungs, and doing some basic neurological tests to assess your reflexes and coordination. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh. A physical examination. Well… I suppose so. I wasn't expecting that. I just thought… a card. But if you think it’s necessary… Alright, go ahead. But please be gentle. I bruise easily, you know. And I don’t like needles. Not at all. Are you going to give me needles? Because if you’re going to give me needles, I think I’m going to need that card beforehand. For courage. Honestly, it's the thought that counts, you know? A little encouragement can go a long way. And please don't poke me too hard. And if I start talking about my neighbor’s cat, just ignore me. He’s very unsettling. Is that alright? Are you listening? This is important.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mrs. Micucci, I am listening. And I will be as gentle as possible. We will start with your blood pressure, and then listen to your heart and lungs. We will not start with a needle today, I promise. We can discuss blood work later, if needed. And I will try my best to ignore any mentions of unsettling cats. Let’s start with your blood pressure, alright?
PATIENT: Alright. Blood pressure first, you say? Very well. But please tell me… do you have any nice cards? With flowers, perhaps? Or a little bird? It would really help me relax. Honestly, it's just a little thing, but it would mean a lot. And try not to squeeze my arm too tight. It gets a bit sensitive, you know. My husband says I’m being dramatic, but I can feel everything. Everything! And if you happen to see my glasses, could you let me know? I had them just a moment ago. Oh, here they are. Never mind. See? Perfectly fine. Mostly. Alright, let’s get on with it then. But gently, please. Very gently.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mrs. Micucci. Just relax your arm. I’m going to listen with my stethoscope now. Deep breaths. Okay. Blood pressure is 110 over 70. A little on the higher side, but within an acceptable range for now. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Just breathe normally.
PATIENT: Alright. Breathing normally. Though it’s a bit difficult to relax with all this… examination going on. Honestly, it’s unsettling. But I’m trying. Just… listening to my heart and lungs, you say? Very well. Is everything alright? Does it sound normal? My husband says I have a very strong heart. Though he also says I worry too much. He’s always saying something. And please don’t poke me in the back. I’ve always been sensitive there. Is that a normal sound? It sounds a bit… wheezy, doesn’t it? Is that bad? Oh, and if you happen to know a good zucchini recipe, could you let me know? My neighbor keeps leaving it on my doorstep. It’s terribly unsettling.
DOCTOR: Okay. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear, though I do hear a very faint wheeze. That could be related to a number of things, and we'll need to investigate further. Now, I'm just going to check your hands. Any pain or stiffness in your joints?
PATIENT: Oh, my hands. Yes, they’ve been a bit… twingy lately. Not painful, exactly, but… uncomfortable. Especially in the mornings. It’s difficult to open jars, you know. And I like to make pickles. My husband says I make the best pickles in the world. Though he also says I use too much garlic. He’s always saying something. And sometimes my fingers feel a bit… numb. Not all the time, just sometimes. And I have trouble knitting. I used to knit beautiful scarves. But now my hands just… ache. And I keep dropping things. It’s terribly unsettling. And if you happen to see my reading glasses, could you let me know? I had them just a moment ago. Oh, here they are. Never mind. See? Perfectly fine. Mostly. Are my hands alright? Do they look normal? They feel a bit… swollen, don’t they? Is that bad?
DOCTOR: Alright. I see some mild swelling and tenderness in your knuckles, and your range of motion is slightly limited. It could be early signs of arthritis, but we'll need to get some X-rays to confirm. Now, I'm just going to check your reflexes. Can you follow my finger with your eyes?
PATIENT: Oh, reflexes now? Very well. Though I’m not very good at tests. I always worry I’ll do something wrong. My husband says I overthink everything. Just… follow your finger, you say? Very well. Is it going up? Or down? Or sideways? It’s a bit blurry, you know. And my neck is a bit stiff. It’s difficult to turn my head. And I keep forgetting things. Like what I had for breakfast. Or the name of that nice actor. The one who’s always in those adventure films. And my neighbor’s cat keeps staring at me. It’s terribly unsettling. Just… follow your finger, you say? Is it going faster now? Or slower? Very well. And if you happen to see my reading glasses, could you let me know? I had them just a moment ago. Oh, here they are. Never mind. See? Perfectly fine. Mostly. Are my reflexes alright? Do they look normal? I hope I’m not doing something wrong. I always worry I’ll do something wrong. It’s terribly unsettling.
DOCTOR: Alright. Your reflexes are a little bit diminished, and your coordination is slightly off, but not significantly. I’m going to need to order some blood work and X-rays to get a better understanding of what’s going on. Based on what you’ve told me and the physical exam, I suspect you may be experiencing a combination of things – potentially early arthritis, some vitamin deficiencies, and possibly a mild lung issue. The blood work will help us rule out any underlying infections or imbalances, and the X-rays will help us assess the condition of your joints. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Oh. Blood work and X-rays. That sounds… complicated. And expensive, I imagine. And needles. I don’t like needles. Not at all. And will they take long? I have a bridge club meeting on Wednesday. And what about the cat? Will the tests tell me why he keeps staring at me? Honestly, it's terribly unsettling. And will the tests tell me if I’m getting old? My husband says I’m just getting old, but I don’t feel old. I still make a perfectly good dal bhat, you know. And I keep the house tidy. And will the tests tell me if I need a card? A nice card with flowers, perhaps? Or a little bird? Honestly, it's just a little thing, but it would really help me relax. And will they poke me in the back? I’ve always been sensitive there. And can you recommend a good zucchini recipe? My neighbor keeps leaving it on my doorstep. It’s terribly unsettling. And will they tell me if I’m doing something wrong? I always worry I’m doing something wrong. It’s terribly unsettling. Oh, and if you happen to see my reading glasses… Never mind. Here they are. See? Perfectly fine. Mostly. So, will the tests tell me all of that? Will they?
DOCTOR: Okay, Mrs. Micucci, let's go through this one by one. Yes, the blood work and X-rays will take some time, but it won’t take all day. We can schedule them for tomorrow morning. The blood work will involve a small needle prick, but it will be quick. And yes, it is possible the tests can give us more information about why you're feeling fatigued, why your joints are achy, and why you're experiencing these other symptoms. Unfortunately, the tests won’t be able to tell us why your neighbor's cat is staring at you. That sounds like a separate issue you may want to discuss with your neighbor. As for whether you're getting old, the tests will help us assess your overall health and identify any age-related changes. But I can assure you, making a good dal bhat and keeping a tidy house are signs of a very active and capable person. And as for a card… I’m afraid I don’t have any cards with flowers or birds on hand. But I can certainly write a note on your chart summarizing our discussion and reassuring you that we're taking steps to address your concerns. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: A note on the chart? Well… it’s not a card, is it? But… I suppose it’s better than nothing. Though a little bird would have been nice. And a flower. And a kind word or two. Still… a note. Alright. A note will do. For now. But if I happen to see a nice card, will you let me know? Just in case? And will the note tell me if I’m doing something wrong? I always worry I’m doing something wrong. And will the note tell me if the cat is planning something? Honestly, it's terribly unsettling. And will the note tell me a good zucchini recipe? My neighbor keeps leaving it on my doorstep. It’s terribly unsettling. And will the note tell me if I need to worry about my husband? He says I’m just getting old, but I don’t feel old. And will the note tell me if my bridge club friends are talking about me? Honestly, it's terribly unsettling. Alright. A note. Just a note. But please make it a nice note. A very nice note. With kind words. And perhaps a little drawing of a bird. Just in case.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mrs. Micucci. I will write a very nice note on your chart, with kind words. I cannot promise a drawing of a bird, but I will do my best to be reassuring. I understand your concerns and I will address them to the best of my ability. Now, let’s get you scheduled for those tests. My nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood and schedule the X-rays. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
