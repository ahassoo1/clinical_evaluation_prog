DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Steines. It’s lovely to meet you. I'm Dr. Lahn. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just…my blood pressure been a little high, they said. Old age, I reckon. Don't bother me too much, but figured I best get it checked. Don’t have time for fuss, if you know what I mean.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. It’s good you're getting it checked, even if it doesn't bother you too much. We want to make sure everything is alright. “Old age” can certainly bring on changes, but we also want to rule out anything else that might be contributing. To start, can you tell me a little more about when you first noticed your blood pressure was a little high?
PATIENT: Hmm…that was…sometime after George passed. Maybe six, seven months ago? Nurse at the pharmacy took it when I was gettin' his medicine refilled and said I oughta see a doctor. Been meanin’ to, but…life gets in the way, you know? It was just a number, though. Didn’t feel sick or nothin’.
DOCTOR: I understand. Losing George must have been very difficult. It's easy for things to get put off when you're dealing with grief. And it's good that the pharmacist caught it – better to check it out. So, about six or seven months ago…do you remember what the reading was, roughly, if the nurse told you?
PATIENT: She said somethin’ about…one-hundred and forty…over…ninety? Maybe? Numbers ain't my strong suit, never have been. It sounded high, is all I know. I mostly just bake, Doctor. Pies, breads…keeps me busy. Don't pay much attention to numbers unless it’s a recipe.
DOCTOR: That reading is a little elevated, yes. And baking pies and breads sounds wonderful – a much better use of your time than worrying about numbers! Okay. Aside from that reading at the pharmacy, have you had your blood pressure checked anywhere else recently?
PATIENT: No, ma'am. Not since. George… he always took care of all that. Doctor appointments, insurance… everything. I'm kinda lost without him, honestly. Been tryin' to manage, but it’s a lot to keep track of. I'm mostly just hopin’ this ain’t nothin’ serious. Just want to get it sorted and get back to my kitchen.
DOCTOR: I completely understand. It sounds like you've been through a lot, and it’s perfectly normal to feel overwhelmed. We will get this sorted out. I'm happy to help you navigate this. Now, aside from the blood pressure reading, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms…? Let me think…I get a little tired easier than I used to, maybe? But I’m ninety years old, Doctor! I figure some tiredness is to be expected. Headaches now and then, but I get those too. Probably just from the heat. It’s been awful hot this summer. Nothin’ too terrible, really. Just…old age, like I said. Do you need me to list all my aches and pains? ‘Cause that'll take a while.
DOCTOR: No, please don't list every ache and pain! That’s perfectly understandable. Fatigue and headaches can definitely be common, especially with the heat. Just to be thorough, have you noticed any changes in your vision lately?
PATIENT: Vision…? Hmm. Now that you mention it, things do seem a little blurry sometimes. Especially when I'm readin' recipes, which is a problem, seein’ as how I need to read ‘em! Thought it was just my eyes gettin' old too. I’ve been holdin’ the recipe closer and closer, I suppose. Nothin’ drastic, just…a little harder to see the small print. Is that somethin’ to worry about? I can still see well enough to bake, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Okay, blurry vision is good to note. It can be related to blood pressure, among other things. Let’s get a better look at things. Would you mind if I did a quick physical exam?
PATIENT: No, go ahead. The sooner we get this over with, the better. I got a peach pie that needs to go in the oven this afternoon. Don’t want it to spoil. Just be gentle, okay? These old bones ain't what they used to be.
DOCTOR: Of course. I’ll be as gentle as possible. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Then I’ll check your pulse and blood pressure again. And I’ll take a look in your eyes and ears, just to get a better picture of things. Take a nice, deep breath for me… and exhale slowly. Good. And again… Heart sounds are regular, but a little faint. Lungs are clear, but there's some mild wheezing. Now, let’s check your pulse… Pulse is a little irregular and on the slower side. Now, blood pressure… Blood pressure is 150/95. That’s higher than we’d like. Now, I'd like to take a quick look at your eyes, if that’s alright. I’ll just shine a light in them.
PATIENT: Alright, alright. Sounds like a lot of numbers again, don’t it? I just hope it ain't nothin’ too serious. Go ahead with the eyes. Shine away. Just be quick, please. My pie is callin’ my name.
DOCTOR: Okay… opening and closing your eyes for me. Good. And look straight ahead... I'm seeing some mild clouding of the lens, which is common for your age – likely cataracts. There's also some mild narrowing of the blood vessels in the back of your eye. Nothing alarming at the moment, but something we’ll want to keep an eye on. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart one more time. I'm still hearing a slight irregularity. I also want to check your reflexes. Your reflexes are a little diminished, which isn’t uncommon with age. Now, do you have any swelling in your ankles or feet?
PATIENT: No, not really. Sometimes they feel a little… tired at the end of the day, but no swellin’ to speak of. I usually put my feet up after I'm done bakin’. Helps a lot. Are you gonna tell me what all this means, Doctor? All these numbers and lookin’ and listenin’…is it somethin’ bad? I just want to bake my pies!
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. Steines. It's a lot to take in, and I want to explain everything clearly. The combination of the slightly irregular heartbeat, higher blood pressure, and changes in your eyes suggests we need to investigate a little further. It doesn't necessarily mean anything bad, but it does mean we need to rule out a few possibilities. One possibility is high blood pressure that's starting to affect your heart and blood vessels. Another could be something called atrial fibrillation, which is an irregular heartbeat that can sometimes lead to other problems. And the changes in your eyes could be related to high blood pressure or simply age-related changes. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to order a few tests. Would you be willing to have an EKG – that's a simple test to check your heart rhythm?
PATIENT: An…EKG? More tests? Lordy. Look, Doctor, I’m ninety years old! I ain’t keen on bein’ poked and prodded. Will this test tell you if I can still bake my pies? Because that’s really all that matters right now. And how long will it take? I got a peach pie that’s waitin’ on me.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation completely, Ms. Steines. I wouldn’t recommend anything if it wasn’t important, and I promise we’ll keep everything as quick and simple as possible. An EKG is very straightforward. It involves placing a few small stickers on your chest, arms, and legs. It doesn’t involve any poking or prodding, and it only takes about 10-15 minutes. It will help us understand if your heart is beating regularly and if there are any signs of problems. Knowing this will help us decide the best course of action to keep you healthy and…able to bake your pies! If the EKG shows something concerning, we may need to do further testing, but let’s start with this first, okay?
PATIENT: Alright…alright. Ten to fifteen minutes, you say? No pokin’? And it won’t keep me from my pie? Fine. Do your stickers. But if this interferes with my bakin’ schedule, I'm holdin’ you responsible!
DOCTOR: That's the spirit! I promise to be as quick as possible, and I'll do everything I can to make sure your pie isn't affected. Let's get you comfortable on the exam table, and we'll get this done in no time. This may feel a little cool at first, but it shouldn't be uncomfortable. Just relax, and breathe normally. Okay, we're all set. Just relax for a few minutes while the machine does its work. I’ll be right back when it's finished. Let me know if you feel anything uncomfortable.
PATIENT: Alright… just get it over with. My peaches ain't gettin' any younger, you know.
