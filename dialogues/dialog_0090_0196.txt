DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Licano. I’m Dr. Kur. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Um… chronic… fatigue, they said. That's what the paper says, anyway. Honestly, it feels like… just always being tired. Really tired. It’s been going on… a long time, I think. I don’t really keep track of these things anymore.
DOCTOR: "Chronic fatigue"... yes. And when you say "a long time," can you be a little more specific?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Specific… …after my husband, I guess. Maybe… five years? Six? It’s all a bit of a blur, truthfully. Before that I was… busier. Much busier. Now… not so much. It’s just… hard to do things, you know? Even getting out of bed some days.
DOCTOR: Alright. Five or six years after the loss of your husband. And you’ve noticed a significant decrease in your energy levels since then. It’s understandable that such a loss would impact your life. Aside from the fatigue, are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms… … Oh, dear. Let me think. I get… achy. All over. Like a bad flu, but not with a fever. And… sometimes I just feel… fuzzy headed? Like I can’t quite… focus. Does that make sense? It's not a headache, exactly. More like my brain is slow. I don’t sleep well either, but I’ve never been a good sleeper. I don’t know if that counts.
DOCTOR: Aches and a feeling of "fuzziness" or difficulty concentrating. And trouble sleeping, although you say that’s been a long-standing issue. Okay. Have you noticed any changes in your weight recently – either loss or gain?
PATIENT: Oh, weight… I’ve probably lost some. My clothes are a little… looser. But I don't really weigh myself anymore. It was always a bit of a… sensitive subject. Not important, I don’t think. I just don’t eat much these days. Not like I used to. Everything feels like such an effort.
DOCTOR: Alright. Unintentional weight loss. And decreased appetite. Now, have you noticed any problems with your memory?
PATIENT: Memory… Oh, goodness, you’re asking a lot! Well, I forget things, of course. Who doesn’t? Little things mostly. Where I put my keys, what I had for breakfast… things like that. It's not… I don't think it's bad bad. Just… normal for my age, I suppose. It's frustrating sometimes, though. Especially when I'm trying to… remember what I was going to say! It’s like the words just… disappear.
DOCTOR: Okay. Some forgetfulness, mainly with recent events. Now, Ms. Licano, before we proceed further, I need to ask about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any chronic conditions, such as diabetes, heart problems, or thyroid issues?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Medical history… Well, my husband had… heart trouble. But me? Not really. The doctor always said I was… healthy, surprisingly. High blood pressure, maybe, at one point. But they put me on a pill for it. I think I still take it… or maybe I don't. It's all a bit… hazy. I went to the doctor regularly for checkups, but it was mostly just… routine things. Nothing serious, if that makes sense. Medicare pays for everything, so I go when they tell me to.
DOCTOR: High blood pressure managed with medication, but unsure of current compliance. Do you know the name of the medication you were prescribed for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no. I never could remember those names! They all sound the same to me, you know? Little white pills. That’s all I remember. I just take what the pharmacist gives me. They know, I think. Honestly, Doctor, I'm not very good with details. I just want to feel better, you know? This tiredness is… exhausting. .
DOCTOR: Alright. Unclear medication history. Ms. Licano, I understand you want to feel better. However, it’s very important for me to have accurate information about your medical history to determine the cause of your fatigue. Do you have any allergies to medications?
