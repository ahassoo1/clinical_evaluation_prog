DOCTOR: Good morning, Thyra. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Pfennig. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Dr. Pfennig. It’s nice to meet you as well. I'm just here to get some forms filled out, if that's alright. Medicare sent me a bunch of them and I figured it’d be easier to do it here, with someone who could answer questions if I have any.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, that’s perfectly alright, Thyra. We help patients with those forms all the time. It's much easier to do it with a little support. Let’s get started then. Do you have all the forms with you?
PATIENT: Yes, I do. There's quite a pile, isn’t there? I tried to look them over, but some of it was a little confusing.
DOCTOR: Yes, it can be quite a bit to go through! Medicare paperwork often is. Don’t worry, we’ll take our time. I see a few different sections here. Before we dive into these, just so I have a complete picture, is there anything specific you’re concerned about while filling these out?
PATIENT: Hmm… not really concerned, no. Just… I get a little lost with all the boxes and numbers. And sometimes I don’t understand what they’re even asking for. Is there a section that’s usually the trickiest for people? Maybe we could start there?
DOCTOR: That’s a very common experience, Thyra. The medical history section tends to be the most challenging. It asks a lot of detailed questions, and sometimes the wording isn’t very clear. Let’s start there then. I’ll read each question, and you tell me what applies to you. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: That sounds perfect. Thank you. I appreciate you offering to help me with this. It makes it a lot less stressful.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Thyra. That's what we're here for. Alright, let’s start with this first question: “Have you been diagnosed with any chronic medical conditions, such as diabetes, heart disease, asthma, or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Let me think… I had high blood pressure for a little while, a few years back, but the doctor said I got it under control with diet and exercise. He hasn't mentioned it since. Does that count as a diagnosis if it's… managed?
DOCTOR: That’s a very good question, and it’s good you asked. Yes, it does count. Even if it’s currently managed, we need to document that you were diagnosed with high blood pressure. It’s important for your overall health record, and can impact certain medications or procedures. So, we will mark that "Yes." Do you remember around when you were diagnosed with it?
PATIENT: Gosh, that was… hmm. Probably around 2020, I think? Maybe early 2021. I had to go to the doctor pretty regularly for a while to check it, and then he said it was okay and I didn’t need to come back as often. It was during the height of all the COVID stuff, so it's a little blurry.
DOCTOR: Okay, around 2020-2021. That's helpful. And just to clarify, are you currently taking any medications for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: No, I’m not. Like I said, the doctor took me off of them once it got under control. I just try to eat healthy and get some exercise. Mostly walking, I live close to the park so that's nice.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent, Thyra. Lifestyle changes are fantastic. Alright, next question: “Have you ever been hospitalized for any reason other than childbirth?
PATIENT: Let me see… I was in the hospital once, when I was a kid. I broke my arm pretty badly, fell out of a tree. But that was… a long time ago. Does that count? It wasn’t for anything… serious, I guess. Just a broken bone.
DOCTOR: Yes, that does count. We need to document any hospitalizations, even if they were many years ago and for something that seems minor now. It helps give us a complete picture of your medical history. Do you remember approximately what year that happened?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… I was probably… eight or nine years old? So, that would have been… around 1986, maybe? 1987? It was a long time ago. I remember my mom being really worried.
DOCTOR: Okay, around 1986 or 1987. We can put "approximately 1986-1987." And do you recall the type of fracture?
PATIENT: Oh, geez. I think it was a… a compound fracture? That’s what my mom kept saying, but I was just a kid, so I didn’t really understand what that meant. The bone stuck out a little bit, I think. It was pretty bad. They had to put a cast on my arm for a long time.
DOCTOR: Okay, a compound fracture of the arm, approximately 1986-1987. Good. That's helpful. Let’s move on to the next section. It asks about any major surgeries you’ve had. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, I haven't. I've been pretty lucky, I guess. Never had to have any surgeries. Just the broken arm, and that didn't require surgery.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful, Thyra. That’s good to know. Now, this next question is about allergies. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, latex, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… not really. I used to think I was allergic to cats, but I've been around a lot of cats lately and I don't seem to have any trouble. So, I guess not. No known allergies, no.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good. We’ll document “No known allergies.” Now, this is a bit of a long one, but it’s important. It asks about your current medications, including over-the-counter drugs, vitamins, and supplements. Are you currently taking anything regularly?
PATIENT: Let me see… I take a multivitamin every day, just to make sure I’m getting everything I need. And sometimes, when my arthritis is acting up, I take ibuprofen. But that’s not every day, just when I need it. Does that count?
DOCTOR: Yes, that counts. We need to document both the multivitamin and the ibuprofen. What dosage of ibuprofen do you typically take, and how often?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me see… I think it’s 200 milligrams? And I usually take two of them when my arthritis is really bothering me. Maybe… two or three times a week? It really depends on how I’m feeling. Sometimes I don’t need any for weeks at a time. It’s just as needed.
DOCTOR: Okay, multivitamin daily and ibuprofen 400mg as needed, up to two or three times a week. That’s good. Now, let’s talk about your medical history a little more generally. Have you ever been diagnosed with arthritis?
PATIENT: Yes, I have. The doctor said it's osteoarthritis, in my hands and knees mostly. It gets worse in the winter, and when it rains. That’s why I take the ibuprofen sometimes. It's not too bad most of the time, but it can be pretty painful.
DOCTOR: Okay, osteoarthritis of the hands and knees. And how long have you been diagnosed with osteoarthritis?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness… it was probably… about ten years ago now? Maybe a little more. I started noticing the pain in my hands when I was gardening, and then it started to bother my knees too. I went to the doctor, and he said it was arthritis. It's just gotten a little worse over time.
DOCTOR: Okay, diagnosed with osteoarthritis approximately ten years ago. This is all very helpful, Thyra. Now, the next section asks about your family medical history. Do you know of any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… my mom had diabetes, type 2. And my dad… he had heart problems. He had a heart attack when he was pretty young. And my grandma, on my mom’s side, she had… I think it was Alzheimer’s? It's hard to remember exactly. It was a long time ago, and we didn’t talk about it much. That's about all I can think of right now.
DOCTOR: Okay, family history of type 2 diabetes , heart problems , and possible Alzheimer’s disease . This is good to know. Now, the last section of this form is about your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, I don’t. Never have. I don't care for any of that. I like a good cup of tea, but that’s about it.
DOCTOR: Okay, excellent. No smoking, alcohol, or recreational drug use. Alright, that completes this form. Do you have any questions about anything we’ve covered?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, that was a lot! No, I don’t think so. You were very patient with me, and you explained everything really well. I appreciate that. Is there anything else I need to do?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Thyra. It is a lot, and you did great. Just a quick review before we move on. We have a history of managed hypertension, a compound fracture as a child, osteoarthritis, no known allergies, a multivitamin daily, ibuprofen as needed, and a family history of diabetes, heart problems, and possible Alzheimer's. We've noted you don’t smoke, drink or use recreational drugs. The next step is just a quick physical exam to get a baseline. We’ll check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and take a look at your joints. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine. Whatever you need to do. I just want to make sure everything is okay.
DOCTOR: Wonderful. Alright, let's start with your blood pressure. Please relax your arm for me. Just breathe normally. ...138 over 82. A little elevated, but not concerning given it was recently managed. We’ll keep an eye on it. Now, let me listen to your heart and lungs. Please take some deep breaths for me. Heart sounds are regular. Lungs are clear bilaterally. And finally, let’s take a look at your hands and knees. Do you mind showing me where you experience the most discomfort?
PATIENT: It's mostly in these knuckles, right here. They get stiff and swollen, especially in the morning. And sometimes it's hard to grip things. And my knees… it's more of a dull ache, mostly when I walk a lot or go up stairs. It gets worse if it's cold.
DOCTOR: I see some mild swelling in the knuckles of both hands. Range of motion is slightly limited, but not significantly. Your knees have some crepitus with movement, which is common with osteoarthritis. No significant swelling or redness. Alright, that completes the physical exam. Overall, your findings are consistent with osteoarthritis. The elevated blood pressure warrants monitoring, but it’s not an immediate concern. Given your history, I recommend continuing to manage your blood pressure with diet and exercise, and taking ibuprofen as needed for pain relief. We can also discuss some physical therapy exercises to help improve your range of motion and strength. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good. Physical therapy sounds like a good idea. I’ve been meaning to get more exercise anyway. What about the Medicare? Does this all count towards my coverage? I worry about those bills sometimes.
DOCTOR: That’s a very valid concern, Thyra. Yes, this visit and the recommendations we’ve made should be covered under Medicare, provided it’s deemed medically necessary, which I believe it is given your history of osteoarthritis and slightly elevated blood pressure. Our billing department is very familiar with Medicare guidelines. They will submit the claim for you, and they can assist you with any questions you have regarding your coverage or potential out-of-pocket costs. I can have them call you after the visit to discuss it in more detail, if you’d like. Do you have any other questions for me today, Thyra?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. You’ve been very helpful, Dr. Pfennig. I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything so clearly. Having the billing department call me would be great. Thank you.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Thyra. I'm glad I could help. I’ll make a note for the billing department to call you after the visit. They can be reached at 555-1212 if you have any questions before then. Here’s a summary of today’s visit and our recommendations. We discussed managing your blood pressure with diet and exercise, continuing to use ibuprofen as needed, and I’ve recommended physical therapy. We’ll keep an eye on your blood pressure at your follow-up appointments. Is there anything else I can assist you with before you go?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you again, Dr. Pfennig. You’ve put my mind at ease. Have a good day.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Thyra. I'm glad I could help. You have a wonderful day as well, and please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns in the future.
