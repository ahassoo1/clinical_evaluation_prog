DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Mr. Withycombe. I'm Dr. Voytek. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor. It’s… the flushing. My face gets very red, you see. It’s been happening more and more lately. Not sure what to do about it.
DOCTOR: Okay, flushing. And you say it's been happening more frequently recently?
PATIENT: Yes, more. Maybe… three, four times a week now? Before, it was just… when I was really hot, maybe. Or embarrassed. But now… just like that. <gestures vaguely at his face> Red. It feels warm too, sometimes.
DOCTOR: Alright. And does anything specifically seem to trigger it now, even if it’s not heat or embarrassment?
PATIENT: Hmm. That’s a good question. I don’t think so. I eat the same food. I don't… I haven't been doing anything different. Maybe… when I bend over? Sometimes it happens then. But not always. It's very strange.
DOCTOR: Okay. And when you say it feels warm, is it just your face, or does it spread anywhere else?
PATIENT: Just my face, Doctor. And my neck, a little. Not my chest, not my arms… just the top part. It doesn't last very long, maybe a minute or two. Then it goes away. But it's… worrying. I don't like looking so red all the time.
DOCTOR: Alright. Any other symptoms along with the flushing?
PATIENT: No… no, I don’t think so. No headaches. No dizziness. No… fast heart? I don’t know. I haven't really looked. I just feel… warm and red. And a little bit… uncomfortable, you know? It makes me want to hide.
DOCTOR: Okay. And have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: No, not really. I eat about the same. Maybe a little less when I’m… feeling worried about the flushing. But not much. My weight… I haven't weighed myself in a while. I’m still… small, I guess. Like always. <gestures to his frame>
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's talk a little bit about your medical history. Do you have any medical conditions that you’ve been diagnosed with in the past?
PATIENT: No, not really. Nothing… serious. I had the flu a few times, like everyone. And… my wife, she had a lot of problems, but that was a long time ago. I don’t have any… doctors, really. I haven't been to one in years. I try to stay healthy. Eat good food, walk a little. That’s about it.
DOCTOR: Okay. And any surgeries or hospitalizations in the past?
PATIENT: No surgeries. No hospital… except when my wife… passed away. But that wasn't… a normal thing. Just… for her. I was okay. I didn’t need anything. Just… sad. A long time ago. It was… very sad. I don’t like to talk about it. <looks down at his hands>
DOCTOR: Okay. I understand. We don’t have to dwell on that. Any medications you’re currently taking, even over-the-counter things?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing. I don’t take pills. I don’t like them. I try to… deal with things myself. A little bit of rest, maybe some tea. That’s all. I don't like being dependent on… things. I prefer to be… okay on my own.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any allergies to medications or anything else, like food or pollen?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. I eat everything. I’ve never had a… reaction. Maybe a little bit of a stuffy nose in the spring, but nothing serious. No… hives, no trouble breathing. I’m pretty lucky, I think. Never had much trouble with… allergies.
DOCTOR: Okay. Now, a few questions about your family. Does anyone in your family have a history of similar flushing, or any skin conditions, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Hmm. My mother… she had a lot of problems. I don't remember exactly what. She was… very old. She got very sick. And my father… he just… stopped working one day. He had a… weak heart, I think. But I don’t know about flushing. No one ever talked about it. My wife’s family… I didn’t know them very well. She didn’t talk about them much. Sorry I can’t be more helpful. I’m not good with remembering things like that.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s alright. We’ll move on. And finally, do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, no, no. Never. I don't do any of those things. Never have. Never will. It's… bad for you. I try to be healthy. I take care of myself. I don’t need… those things. My wife… she didn’t like them either. So I never started. It’s just… not for me. I prefer tea. A nice, warm cup of tea.
DOCTOR: Okay. Alright, Mr. Withycombe. Thank you for that information. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright. Just listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your skin. It will only take a few minutes. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine, Doctor. Whatever you need. I trust you. I just want to… figure out what’s wrong. I just don't like… feeling so red. It makes me nervous. But… yes, go ahead. Whatever you think is best.
DOCTOR: Okay, your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, 140/90. And I do see some redness on your cheeks and nose. No rash or any other skin changes. Any pain when I touch your face here?
PATIENT: No, no pain, Doctor. Just… warm. It's always warm when it's red. Like… a hot flush. But not… sore. Just… different. And it comes and goes, you know? It’s not always red. Sometimes it's okay. But it's been happening more and more. I worry it's something… serious. I don’t want to be sick.
DOCTOR: Okay. And I notice some mild swelling around your neck. Can you bend your head forward for me, please?
PATIENT: Yes, I can. Like this? <pauses> Does that make it worse? I can feel a little… pressure, maybe. Not pain, just… something. It’s hard to explain. I don’t usually pay attention to my neck. It just… is.
DOCTOR: Okay. And can you try looking up towards the ceiling for me?
PATIENT: Yes, like this? Is something wrong? It doesn’t really feel… different. Just… stretching my neck a little. I used to have a bad neck from working, but that was a long time ago. It doesn’t bother me much anymore. I just want to know what’s causing the flushing. It’s… unsettling.
DOCTOR: Okay. Thank you. Alright, Mr. Withycombe. Based on what you've told me and the physical exam, a few things could be going on. The swelling and flushing, particularly with bending your head forward, could indicate a possible issue with your thyroid. The elevated blood pressure is something we need to monitor as well. I’d like to order some blood tests to check your thyroid function, as well as a complete blood count and a basic metabolic panel. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Blood tests… yes, that’s fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgment. I just want to know what’s wrong, and what I can do about it. I don’t like feeling… uncertain. So yes, blood tests are good. When can I get them done? And… will they be expensive? I don’t have… insurance, you see.
DOCTOR: Okay. I understand your concern about the cost. We can see if the lab has a payment plan or reduced rates for uninsured patients. I'll have the nurse give you the lab requisition and information on pricing. The lab is just across the street, and you don't need an appointment. We can get those done today, if you’d like. Once we have the results, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and decide on the best course of action. It could be nothing serious, but it’s best to rule things out. How does that sound?
PATIENT: That sounds… good, Doctor. Thank you. Across the street is… convenient. And I appreciate you checking about the cost. It's… a worry, you see. Okay, I will go across the street now. And then I will call to schedule a follow-up? Thank you for your time, Doctor Voytek. I feel… a little better, just knowing we’re looking into it.
DOCTOR: Yes, exactly. The nurse will give you the number to call to schedule your follow-up appointment once you've had the tests done. And don't hesitate to call us sooner if you experience any new or worsening symptoms. Please try to rest and avoid strenuous activity for now. Alright. Have a good afternoon, Mr. Withycombe.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too.
