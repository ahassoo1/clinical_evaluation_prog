DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Orwin. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Iuzzolino. It’s good to meet you. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Right. Well, I have an appointment for… a clearance, I believe? For getting a little work done. Don’t have all day, you know. Just need a quick look-see so I can get on with things.
DOCTOR: Yes, a pre-operative clearance. I understand wanting to be efficient, Mr. Orwin. Just to be thorough, could you tell me a little bit about the work you're having done?
PATIENT: Oh, it's nothing major. A bit of… tightening. Face is starting to droop a little, you see? Wife always said I had a handsome face, but… well, she's gone now. Doesn't matter, really. Just want to look presentable. The doctor – good man, very skilled – said I needed this clearance first. Don’t see why, but he's the expert.
DOCTOR: I see. A cosmetic procedure, then. And you're right to get it cleared – just want to make sure everything is optimal for a good outcome. Just to get a good picture of your overall health, could you tell me about any medical problems you have now, or have had in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, the usual. Old age, mostly. Bit of arthritis in the hands, makes the terrazzo work a little harder these days, but I manage. Blood pressure’s been a bit up and down, but nothing a little walking doesn’t fix. Had a touch of pneumonia a few years back, but recovered fine. Honestly, I’m a sturdy Norwegian. We don't get sick easily. Now, are we almost done?
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, Mr. Orwin. “Sturdy Norwegian” is excellent. Just a few more questions to be thorough. Do you take any medications regularly?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Oh, yes. A little pill for the blood pressure, sometimes. Losartan, I think it’s called. And a little something for the arthritis when it flares up – ibuprofen, usually. Don’t take them every day, mind you. Only when I need to. And a vitamin D, the doctor said my levels were a little low. That’s it, I think. Don't bother me with fancy names, I just take what they tell me to.
DOCTOR: Alright, Losartan for blood pressure, ibuprofen as needed, and Vitamin D. Good. And do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Not that I know of. Never been one for fancy foods, so haven't had much chance to be allergic to anything. Bit sensitive to dust when I'm working with the terrazzo, but that's just a bit of a cough. Nothing serious. Honestly, doctor, are you sure you need all this information? It's just a little facelift, not open-heart surgery.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Orwin. It’s just standard procedure to get a complete picture, even for a smaller procedure, to ensure everything goes smoothly and to minimize any risks. Now, one last few quick questions, then we can get to the physical exam. Have you ever had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Let me think... well, I had my appendix out when I was a boy, back in Norway. That was... a long time ago. And I broke my arm once, falling off a roof while working. They set it, put it in a cast. Nothing major. Other than that... no. Not that I recall. Really, is this all necessary? I have things to do today.
DOCTOR: Alright, appendectomy as a child and a broken arm. Thank you. And lastly, do you have any family history of significant medical conditions – heart disease, diabetes, cancer, anything like that?
PATIENT: Family history? My family was hardy farmers and fishermen back in Norway! They lived long lives, working hard, eating simple food. No fancy diseases, that’s for sure. My grandfather lived to be 95, still chopping wood at 90! Probably died of old age, if I recall correctly. Now, can we please get on with this? I’m starting to get impatient. I told my neighbor I'd be back an hour ago.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Orwin. We are almost finished. Just a quick physical exam, and then we can discuss everything. Alright, let's start with your blood pressure. Could you please roll up your sleeve?
PATIENT: Fine, fine. But don't take all day, doctor. Honestly, this is more trouble than the surgery itself. Get it over with.
DOCTOR: Alright, just relax for a moment. 142 over 88. A little elevated, but not unexpected. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a few deep breaths for me. Your heart sounds regular, although a little faint. Lungs are clear, but I can hear some mild wheezing. Have you had any shortness of breath lately?
PATIENT: Wheezing? Well, I get a little winded sometimes when I’m climbing ladders, but that's just old age! I told you, I’m a terrazzo worker. It’s hard work. Haven’t needed any fancy inhalers or anything. Just a bit of a cough sometimes, especially when it’s dusty. Honestly, I think you're making too much of this. Can we get to the face now? I want to know if I can schedule the surgery.
DOCTOR: Alright. Your thyroid feels normal. Reflexes are a bit diminished, but that’s common with age. Your face appears symmetrical, with some mild skin laxity as you mentioned. Mr. Orwin, while you seem generally healthy, your blood pressure is elevated, and I hear some mild wheezing in your lungs. Before we clear you for surgery, I would like to run a few simple tests - a blood test to check your overall health and a chest X-ray to get a better look at your lungs. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Tests?! Absolutely not! I came here for a quick clearance, not a full medical workup! I haven’t got time for tests and X-rays. This is ridiculous. I’ve lived a long life without needing all this poking and prodding. The doctor said I was fit for surgery! I trust his judgement. Honestly, doctor, are you trying to waste my time? I'm going to go now. This is a complete waste of an hour. .
DOCTOR: Mr. Orwin, I understand your frustration, but my priority is your safety. While your doctor may have deemed you suitable for surgery, it is my professional responsibility to ensure you are in optimal health before proceeding, especially given these findings. I strongly recommend we proceed with the blood test and chest X-ray. However, I respect your autonomy. Here is a referral to a cardiologist and a pulmonologist. I advise you to consult with them before proceeding with the surgery. Thank you for coming in, Mr. Orwin. If you change your mind, please don't hesitate to call the clinic. .
