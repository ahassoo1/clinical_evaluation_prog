DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Boham. I am Dr. Paraskevopoulos. It says here you're forty years of age. Please, have a seat. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Yes, forty years, that is right. It’s… my sinuses, I think. They been bothering me for… a little while now. I don't remember exactly how long, but it’s not good. It feels… stuffy.
DOCTOR: “A little while now,” is rather imprecise, Ms. Boham. We strive for accuracy here. Could you perhaps narrow that down to weeks, months?
PATIENT: Oh… yes, accuracy. I understand. Hmm… maybe… two, three months? It’s hard to say, Doctor. Things… they all sort of blend together sometimes. It’s not constant pain, you understand. More like… pressure. Especially when the weather changes.
DOCTOR: Two to three months. Very well. And this pressure… where exactly are you feeling it?
PATIENT: Right… here, and here. Around my eyes, mostly. And sometimes… in my teeth. It feels like a… a dull ache, Doctor. Not sharp. Just… uncomfortable. It makes it hard to concentrate at work, sometimes.
DOCTOR: Concentration difficulties… I see. And have you noticed any other symptoms accompanying this sinus pressure?
PATIENT: Other… symptoms? Hmm. Well, I have been… tired. More tired than usual. And maybe… a little bit of a cough? Not a bad cough, just… little ones. And I think my nose… it sometimes runs. But mostly, it’s the pressure, Doctor. It's the pressure that bothers me the most.
DOCTOR: Tiredness, mild cough, and nasal discharge. Let's proceed with a brief examination, Ms. Boham, to better assess the situation. Could you please lie back on the examination table?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. Just let me know if you need me to do anything.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Boham. I’m going to take a look in your ears first. Just relax. Now, open your mouth and say "Ah". Listens briefly with the otoscope. Ears appear clear. Now, let's examine your nasal passages. Some mild congestion noted, with slightly swollen turbinates. No significant purulent discharge observed at this time. Tenderness to palpation over the frontal and maxillary sinuses. We'll need to gather a bit more information. Do you have any known allergies?
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmm… I don’t think so, Doctor. Not that I know of. I haven't ever really paid much attention to it. Maybe… dust? Sometimes I feel a little… stuffy when I’m cleaning, but that's all. Is that an allergy? I don’t really know. My husband, he has some allergies, but I don’t think I do.
DOCTOR: Possible dust sensitivity. We will proceed as though that is a factor. And are you currently taking any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, or herbal supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I don't take anything regularly. Not even vitamins. I try to eat healthy, that’s what my mother always told me. No medicines, no pills, nothing like that. I prefer not to take anything if I don't need to, you understand? It worries me, all those side effects I hear about.
DOCTOR: Prudent approach. Now, Ms. Boham, have you had any previous surgeries or serious illnesses?
PATIENT: Surgeries… let me think. I had my tonsils out when I was a little girl, a long time ago. That's all I can remember. Serious illnesses… Nothing serious, no. Maybe a bad flu once or twice, but nothing that required a hospital stay or anything like that. I’ve been pretty healthy, all my life. I think. It's hard to remember everything, Doctor. It's been a long time.
DOCTOR: Tonsillectomy in childhood, otherwise healthy. And finally, Ms. Boham, is there a family history of allergies, asthma, or sinus problems?
PATIENT: Family… hmm. My mother, she always had a little cough, especially in the winter. But I don't think it was allergies, more like… a cold. And my uncle, on my father’s side, he had… asthma, I think. When he was a boy. But other than that… not really. No one else that I remember having problems with their sinuses, or anything like that. It's a small family, you see. Is that important, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Relevant information. Alright, Ms. Boham, based on your history and examination, it appears you are likely experiencing sinusitis, possibly exacerbated by a mild sensitivity to dust. The tenderness upon palpation and the congestion support this assessment. However, to rule out other possibilities and determine the severity, I recommend a chest X-ray. It's a precautionary measure, to ensure there is no underlying infection. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: A… a chest X-ray? Is something… serious wrong, Doctor? I thought it was just my sinuses. And I’m not insured, you see. Will that be very expensive? Is there anything else we can do, instead?
DOCTOR: Ms. Boham, I understand your concerns. The X-ray is a precautionary measure, to rule out other possible causes for your symptoms, such as pneumonia. It doesn’t necessarily indicate something serious is wrong. It simply allows us to get a more complete picture of your condition. As for the cost, I recognize you are uninsured. We do have options. We can explore a cash price for the X-ray, or I can refer you to a facility that offers financial assistance programs. The cash price will likely be around $200-300. Alternatively, we can try a course of saline nasal rinses and over-the-counter decongestants for the next week, and if your symptoms don't improve, we can revisit the X-ray discussion. However, please understand that without the X-ray, we cannot definitively rule out other conditions. What are your thoughts?
PATIENT: $200… that’s… a lot of money. The saline rinses… those sound okay. I’ve heard of those. And I could try the decongestants. But which ones? There are so many in the store. And… if I try those for a week and it doesn’t get better… then what? Will I have to come back and pay for the X-ray anyway? I’m just… worried about the cost, Doctor. My husband, he works very hard, but money is still tight.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Ms. Boham. Your concerns are valid. We can certainly try the saline rinses and over-the-counter decongestants for one week. I recommend a simple saline nasal spray, used twice daily. For the decongestant, I suggest pseudoephedrine, but please be aware that it may raise your blood pressure slightly. If you have any history of high blood pressure, heart problems, or glaucoma, do not use it. Otherwise, follow the dosage instructions on the package. If your symptoms do not improve after one week, then yes, we would need to consider the chest X-ray to rule out other possibilities. I can provide a prescription for the saline nasal spray, and I will write down the name of the decongestant for you. And to reiterate, if you experience any worsening of your symptoms – fever, severe headache, chest pain, shortness of breath – please seek immediate medical attention. Do you have any other questions before we proceed?
PATIENT: No high blood pressure… thankfully. My husband, he checks everything. Pseudo… pseudoephedrine… okay, I can remember that. And twice a day with the saline… Yes, that sounds… manageable. And if it doesn't get better… then I’ll have to come back for the X-ray… I just hope it doesn't come to that. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very patient with me.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Boham. I understand your concerns, and I'm happy to work with you. Please, don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. Here is the prescription and the information on the decongestant. We will schedule a follow-up appointment in one week to assess your progress. I wish you a speedy recovery.
