DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Baide. I’m Dr. Nestingen. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Look, I haven’t got all day, you know. This…tremor. It’s in my hands. Makes things difficult. Especially when I’m…well, when I’m working. Though, truthfully, I haven’t been doing much work lately. Not like the old days.
DOCTOR: A tremor, you say. In your hands. And it’s interfering with…work?
PATIENT: Interfering is putting it mildly! It’s…annoying, mostly. Makes a nice cup of espresso impossible, for one. And trying to…direct. You need a steady hand for that, you know. Though, like I said, it’s been a while. Honestly, I don’t even remember the last time I was really directing. It's just…there. This shaking. Is that all you need to know?
DOCTOR: Espresso… directing. Right. And how long has this tremor been present, Mr. Baide?
PATIENT: How long…? Geez, that’s a question. A while now, I suppose. Months? Years? Everything’s a blur these days. It started…gradually, I think. I just noticed I couldn't hold things as steady. You know, little things. Like a fork. Or a…well, never mind. It's just been getting worse, that's what matters. It wasn’t a sudden thing, if that’s what you’re asking.
DOCTOR: Months to years…gradual onset. Alright. And has anything specifically made it worse?
PATIENT: Worse? Hmm…stress, maybe? Though I haven’t had a good stress in years. Not since…well. Look, I don’t really pay attention to what makes it worse. I just notice it’s there. Honestly, doctor, I’m not one for dwelling on things. It is what it is. It gets worse when I try to do something delicate, I suppose. Like…writing. Or holding a glass. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: Delicate movements exacerbate it. Alright. And are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms? What do you mean? Like…a cold? No, no, I feel fine, other than this…shaking. A little tired, maybe. Old age, you know? Everything aches a bit. But that's just…living. I'm not falling apart, if that’s what you're thinking. Just this tremor. Are we getting anywhere with this? I’ve got things to do, you know. Not important things, but things nonetheless.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's do a quick neurological exam, Mr. Baide. Just to get a baseline. Can you follow my finger with your eyes without moving your head?
PATIENT: Follow your finger…? Honestly, doctor, I'm not a dog. I can see perfectly fine. But…fine, fine. Just get it over with. There. I'm following it. Is that what you wanted? Are we done yet?
DOCTOR: Your eye movements are a little…jerky. Now, can you hold your hands out in front of you, palms up?
PATIENT: There. See? Like this. It’s worse when I'm nervous, you know. All these…tests. It's…irritating, frankly. Is this going to take much longer? I really don't have the patience for…all this.
DOCTOR: Yes, I see. It's a resting tremor, Mr. Baide. And it appears to be quite pronounced. Now, can you tap your thumb to each of your fingers, one at a time, on this hand?
PATIENT: One, two…three…four… This is ridiculous. I used to be able to do this without even thinking. Now look at me. A complete mess. There. Happy? Honestly, I feel like I'm failing a child’s test. Is this going to lead to anything? Or is it just…old age?
DOCTOR: Based on this brief examination, and your history, it’s difficult to say definitively, Mr. Baide. However, this presentation is consistent with a possible essential tremor. Though, we must rule out other possibilities. I’m going to order some blood work to check your thyroid levels, and rule out any other underlying medical conditions. I'm also going to schedule you for an appointment with a neurologist for a more comprehensive evaluation. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Blood work? A neurologist? Honestly. Look, I've lived a long life, okay? I don’t need a bunch of tests and specialists poking around. I just wanted to know if it was something serious. If it’s not…can’t I just leave it at that? I'm not looking for a diagnosis, just…reassurance. Honestly, this is more trouble than it's worth. .
DOCTOR: Mr. Baide, I understand your frustration, but it’s my responsibility to ensure we’ve ruled out anything serious. While it may be essential tremor, a neurologist can confirm this, and discuss possible management options. I strongly recommend you keep the appointment. Here’s a referral. As for reassurance, I can tell you that essential tremor is rarely life-threatening, but it can impact your quality of life. The blood work will help us be certain. I’ll have the nurse draw the blood before you leave. Do you have any questions before you go?
