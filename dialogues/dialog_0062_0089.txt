DOCTOR: Hi Alese, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Decosta. Thanks for coming in today. So, what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It is good to meet you as well. My goodness, time just… slips away, doesn’t it? Well, to be frank, it’s this pain. Down low, in my belly. It’s been… troubling me again. I suppose that’s what brought me in. It’s hard to say exactly when it started, though. Everything feels a bit… fuzzy these days.
DOCTOR: Okay, “down low in the belly,” that gives me a starting point. And it's okay that the timing is fuzzy – we'll work through it. Can you describe the pain for me?
PATIENT: Hmm… describe it. Yes. Well, it’s not… a sharp pain, not usually. More of a… a heavy ache, I think. Like someone is pressing on me, quite firmly. Sometimes it feels like… twisting, a little. And it comes and goes, you see. It’s not constant. Some days are better than others, certainly. I do recall it being quite severe a few times recently, though. Enough to make me… pause, you understand.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. A heavy ache with twisting, comes and goes, and has been quite severe at times. That's helpful. When you say "recently," can you give me a timeframe?
PATIENT: Oh dear, timeframe… that is the tricky part, isn’t it? Let me think… I believe it was… after the garden club luncheon? Yes, I think so. That was… oh, goodness, was that in July? Or perhaps June? It feels like a lifetime ago. It’s definitely been more frequent in the last few weeks, though. More bothersome, certainly. I've been trying to ignore it, but it's… difficult to.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it started potentially in June or July, and has been more frequent and bothersome in the last few weeks. I appreciate you trying to pinpoint the timing! Besides the pain, have you noticed any other changes or symptoms that seem to happen around the same time?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, symptoms… let me see. Well, I have been feeling a bit more tired than usual, I suppose. But then, at my age, aren’t we always a bit tired? And… I don’t know if this is related, but my hands have been feeling a bit… achy. Not terribly, just… stiff sometimes. And a little swollen, perhaps? It’s hard to say. Everything feels a little… off, generally.
DOCTOR: Okay, so increased fatigue, some hand aching and stiffness, possibly some swelling. That’s good information. Have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits – anything different with your stool, or how often you're going?
PATIENT: Oh, my. That is a rather… personal question, isn’t it? Well… let me think. I have been a little… irregular, I suppose. Not terribly so, but not my usual self, certainly. And… sometimes it’s a little difficult, you understand. Not painful, exactly, just… a bit of a struggle. It’s not something I’ve paid much attention to, if I’m honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, some irregularity and difficulty with bowel movements. Thank you for sharing that, it’s helpful for me to get a full picture. Now, have you experienced any nausea, vomiting, fever, or chills recently?
PATIENT: No, no fever or chills, thankfully. And I haven’t been sick to my stomach, no. I haven’t vomited at all. I do get a little queasy sometimes, a bit of a flutter in my stomach, but nothing serious. It passes quickly, you see. It’s not… debilitating, certainly. I suppose it could be something I ate, though. I do enjoy a good pastry.
DOCTOR: Okay, no fever, chills, or vomiting, just occasional queasiness. That's good to know. Now, I'd like to ask about your medical history, if you don't mind. Do you have any known medical conditions?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, medical history… that’s a long story, I’m afraid. Let me see… Well, the doctor told me years ago I have… SLE. Systemic Lupus Erythematosus. That’s what it was called. It flares up from time to time, you see. I take medication for it, of course. And… I believe I had some trouble with my kidneys, years ago. But I’ve been seeing a specialist for that, regularly. It's all a bit… hazy.
DOCTOR: Okay, SLE and a history of kidney issues. Thank you for letting me know. Do you know what medications you're currently taking for your lupus, and for any other conditions?
PATIENT: Oh dear, the medications… that’s where it gets tricky. I have so many little bottles! Let me think… There’s… Plaquenil, yes, I take Plaquenil. And… a water pill, I believe, for my kidneys. Something with a “-zone” in the name? And… oh, goodness, I take something for my blood pressure, too. Amlodipine, perhaps? It's all terribly confusing, you see. I have a list at home, I’m quite sure. But I didn't bring it with me.
DOCTOR: Okay, Plaquenil, a water pill , and Amlodipine for blood pressure. That’s helpful to know. We can definitely look up the full list later if you'd like. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Oh, surgeries… let me see. Yes, I had my gallbladder removed, years ago. That was… quite unpleasant, if I recall correctly. And… I think I had a small procedure on my knee, many years ago. Something to do with a torn cartilage, perhaps? It’s all a bit… fuzzy, you see. It was a long time ago. Nothing major, certainly.
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder removal and a knee procedure. Thank you. Now, thinking about your family - is there a family history of any medical conditions, like lupus, kidney disease, or any cancers?
PATIENT: Oh, family history… that’s a good question. My mother… she had arthritis, quite badly. And my aunt… I believe she had some trouble with her kidneys, yes. It was quite a long time ago, though. And… oh dear, my cousin… she had breast cancer, many years ago. It was very sad, of course. But I don't recall anyone else with lupus, specifically.
DOCTOR: Okay, arthritis, kidney issues, and breast cancer in the family. Thank you. Finally, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Oh, my lifestyle... Well, I'm retired now, so I don't work. I enjoy gardening, as I mentioned. And I’m quite involved with the garden club, you see. I live alone, in a little cottage just outside of town. I try to eat healthy, mostly. Though I do enjoy a good pastry now and then! I don't smoke, and I rarely drink alcohol. I try to stay active, though my joints sometimes make that difficult.
DOCTOR: Okay, retired, enjoys gardening and the garden club, lives alone, healthy diet with occasional pastries, doesn't smoke, rarely drinks, and tries to stay active. That’s very helpful. Alright, Alese, thank you for sharing all of that information with me. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, and gently feel your abdomen to see if we can pinpoint the source of your pain. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly alright. Whatever you think is best. My goodness, you’ve been very thorough. I appreciate you listening so patiently to my ramblings. Go right ahead, please. I’m ready whenever you are.
DOCTOR: Great. First, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Just relax and take some deep breaths for me. Okay, heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear, good air entry bilaterally. Now, I’m going to gently feel your abdomen. Please let me know if anything feels particularly tender. Okay. I am noticing some mild tenderness in your lower abdomen, primarily on your right side. It doesn't seem to be any acute guarding or rigidity, which is good. I also notice some slight swelling in that area. I'm going to listen to your abdomen now with the stethoscope. Bowel sounds are present, but slightly diminished. Overall, the exam doesn't point to anything immediately life-threatening, but there are some findings that warrant further investigation.
PATIENT: Oh, diminished bowel sounds… that doesn’t sound good, does it? Well, I must say, I have been a little… constipated lately. Perhaps that’s related? Further investigation… what does that entail, Doctor? I do hope it’s nothing too serious.
DOCTOR: It's good that you mentioned the constipation, that definitely could be contributing to the diminished bowel sounds. And you're right to ask about further investigation. Given your history of lupus and the tenderness I found, I'd like to order a few tests to get a clearer picture of what's going on. First, I want to do a complete blood count, or CBC, to check for signs of inflammation or infection. We’ll also check your kidney function again, just to be safe. Then, I'd like to order a CT scan of your abdomen and pelvis. This will give us a more detailed look at your organs and rule out any other potential causes for your pain. Does that sound okay to you?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. A CT scan… that sounds rather… involved. But… if that’s what you think is best, Doctor, then yes, of course. I trust your judgment. Inflammation, you say? Could this be a lupus flare-up, then? I do get worried about my kidneys, you see. They’ve been… troublesome in the past. A complete blood count and a scan… yes, that sounds sensible. Please, do whatever you think is necessary to find out what’s wrong.
DOCTOR: Okay, Alese. It could be a lupus flare-up, and we want to rule that out, as well as other possibilities. We'll get those tests ordered right away. In the meantime, I'm going to prescribe a stool softener to help with the constipation. That might alleviate some of your discomfort. I'm also going to give you a list of "red flag" symptoms to watch out for - things like high fever, severe abdominal pain, vomiting, or blood in your stool. If you experience any of those, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Once we have the results of the blood work and the CT scan, we can discuss them and come up with a treatment plan. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Oh, a stool softener… that sounds rather pleasant, actually. And red flag symptoms… yes, of course, that makes sense. High fever, severe pain, blood… yes, I’ll keep a close eye out for those. It’s good to know what to look for. A treatment plan… yes. I do appreciate you taking the time to investigate this, Doctor. It’s a little frightening when things flare up, you see. But I feel much better knowing we’re taking steps to find out what’s wrong. So, thank you. When should I expect to hear about the test results?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Alese. I understand your anxiety, and we'll get to the bottom of this. The lab results usually come back within 24-48 hours. The CT scan results can take a little longer, typically 24-72 hours, as they need to be reviewed by a radiologist. My office will call you as soon as we have them. In the meantime, if your pain worsens significantly, or if you develop any new symptoms, don’t hesitate to call the office, even if it's outside of regular business hours. We have a doctor on call. Do you have any questions for me before we wrap up?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s good to know about the doctor on call. No, I don’t think I have any more questions at the moment. You've been very thorough, Doctor, and you've put my mind at ease. Thank you again for your time and attention. I’ll be sure to call if anything changes. And… thank you for listening to my ramblings about my knees and my garden club. It’s nice to feel heard, you see.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Alese. It’s my job, and I'm glad I could help. And please, don’t apologize for sharing. Knowing those details can be helpful! We’ll get those tests ordered right away, and we’ll be in touch as soon as we have the results. Have a good day, and please take care of yourself. Don't hesitate to call if you need anything at all.
PATIENT: Oh, thank you, Doctor. You as well. And… I will. I promise. Goodbye.
