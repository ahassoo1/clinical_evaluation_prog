DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Hilber. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Beinborn. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s good to meet you too. Well, it's… it’s my water. I have trouble… getting it all out, when I go to the bathroom. It just… stops, sometimes. It’s been happening for a little while now, and it’s getting… troublesome.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Trouble completely emptying your bladder, and it’s been gradually worsening. Can you tell me a bit more about that?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. It’s not… sudden. It started slowly. I’d just feel like there was still a little bit left, even after I was done. Now… now it feels like a lot sometimes. And I have to… strain a bit to get it all out. It’s not painful, not really, just… uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Uncomfortable, and requiring straining. Okay. And about how long has this been going on, would you say?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It’s been… maybe six months, now? Could be a little longer. It’s hard to say exactly. Things… blur together when you get to be my age, you know? It wasn't bad enough to come see a doctor right away. Just… something I noticed.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s common for things to develop gradually. Six months, roughly. Have you noticed any changes in how you urinate, besides the difficulty emptying?
PATIENT: Well… now that you mention it… I seem to be going to the bathroom more often. Especially at night. I wake up a couple of times to go. I didn't used to do that. Just… a little bit each time, but still. More often.
DOCTOR: Okay, increased frequency, especially at night – that’s nocturia. And during the day, is it a strong urge to go, or just more frequent small amounts?
PATIENT: It's… both, I think. Sometimes I get a strong urge, yes. Like I have to go right away. Other times, it’s just… a little bit at a time, more often than I used to. It’s hard to explain. I don't feel like I can hold it as long as I once could, that's for sure.
DOCTOR: Alright, so a sense of urgency sometimes, and difficulty holding it, along with increased frequency. Have you experienced any fever, chills, or pain in your back or side?
PATIENT: No, no fever or chills. And my back… no, doesn’t hurt. Sometimes my lower belly feels a little… full, when I can’t get everything out. But not pain, really. Just… uncomfortable and full. Like it’s not… empty.
DOCTOR: Okay, no fever, chills, or back pain, just a feeling of fullness in the lower abdomen. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your medical history. Do you have any past medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Well… I had my appendix out when I was a young man. A long time ago. And… my wife, she passed away five years ago. Heart trouble. I mostly just try to stay active, walk when I can. I don’t really have any other… conditions. I take a little something for my blood pressure, but that’s it.
DOCTOR: Okay, appendectomy in the past, and you manage your blood pressure. I'm sorry to hear about your wife. What medication are you taking for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. It was a while back now. As for the medicine… hmm. Let me see… I have it here somewhere. It’s called… Lisinopril. Ten milligrams. I take one every morning.
DOCTOR: Lisinopril, ten milligrams daily. Do you have any allergies to medications, or anything else, as far as you know?
PATIENT: No, not that I'm aware of. Never had a bad reaction to anything, thankfully. I used to help my wife with her garden, and I’d get stung by bees sometimes, but that was just a sting. Nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright. Just to get a better understanding of what might be going on. We’ll check your abdomen, and I’ll do a quick neurological check. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgement. I haven't had a proper check-up in a while, so anything is good, really.
DOCTOR: Wonderful. If you could lie down for me, please. I’m going to start by listening to your abdomen with my stethoscope, and then I'll gently press on different areas to check for any tenderness. Please let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. I’m not hearing any unusual sounds at this time. Now, I’m going to gently press here… and here… any discomfort?
PATIENT: No, that doesn't hurt. A little… pressure, maybe, but no real pain. Just feels… normal. A little sensitive, perhaps, down low, where I was saying it feels full, but nothing sharp. It’s hard to explain. Like a… fullness.
DOCTOR: Okay, some fullness in the lower abdomen with palpation. I’m also going to check your neurological function briefly, just to assess your reflexes and sensation. This will help rule out any nerve-related issues. Can you point your toes and heels up for me?
PATIENT: Yes, I can. Like this? Is that alright? I haven't done this in a long time, so I hope I'm doing it right.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s perfect. Good strength in your legs. Now, I’m going to lightly touch your legs with this cotton swab. Can you tell me when you feel it?
PATIENT: Yes, I can. I feel it… there. And there. Seems… normal to me. I used to go fishing a lot, and I have pretty good feeling in my feet. Gotta feel the fish on the line, you know?
DOCTOR: I do know. Okay, good sensation in your legs. Everything seems fairly normal with the neurological exam. Based on what you've told me, and the quick exam I’ve done, it sounds like you might be experiencing urinary retention, and possibly an enlarged prostate. It’s common in men your age. To be certain, I’d like to order a few tests – a urine analysis to check for infection, and a PSA blood test to assess your prostate. We may also need to do an ultrasound of your bladder to see how completely it empties. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… reasonable, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. Tests seem… sensible. I trust your judgement. An enlarged prostate… is that… serious? I haven’t heard much about it.
DOCTOR: It can be, but often it’s manageable. An enlarged prostate, also known as benign prostatic hyperplasia or BPH, is very common as men age. It can cause the symptoms you’re experiencing – difficulty urinating, frequency, and retention. The PSA test will help us assess if there’s any concern for something more serious, like prostate cancer, but most of the time, it’s just BPH. For now, we’ll start with the urine analysis and PSA test. I'll write you a requisition, and you can take it to the lab. I'll also give you a referral to a urologist for further evaluation. They are the specialists in this area. Does that sound like a good plan?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… good. A plan is good. A specialist… that seems right. I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly, Doctor. It… eases my mind a bit. Just knowing what’s going on… that helps.
DOCTOR: I'm glad I could help. Here are the requisitions for the lab tests, and this is the referral to Dr. Anya Sharma, a urologist. She's excellent. The lab results usually take a few days, and the urologist's office will contact you to schedule an appointment. In the meantime, try to drink plenty of water, but avoid drinking large amounts before bed. Do you have any questions for me before we finish up?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. You’ve explained everything very thoroughly. Water… and not too much before bed. I can do that. Thank you, Doctor Beinborn. I appreciate your kindness and patience. It's good to know someone is listening.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Hilber. I’m glad I could help. Please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any questions or concerns. We're here to support you. Take care, and I look forward to hearing from you after you've had the tests done.
