DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Guerrerolopez. So, you’re here today… tell me, what brings you in?
PATIENT: Uh, yes. Right. My… ears. They feel… full. Like something’s blocking them. It’s been… a while now. Not painful, just… stuffy. Honestly, I can’t really say when it started. Things aren’t what they used to be, you know?
DOCTOR: "A while now," is not terribly helpful, Mr. Guerrerolopez. We need some timeframe to work with. Was it weeks?
PATIENT: Weeks… maybe? Or months? Everything’s a bit… blurry. I’ve been meaning to get it checked, honestly. My wife… she would always remind me. But… well. It’s just been… difficult to keep track of things since then. Sorry. Is weeks okay? If not… I truly don’t know.
DOCTOR: “Difficult to keep track of things.” Alright. Weeks it is, then. And is this fullness in both ears, or just one?
PATIENT: Both, I think. Yes, definitely both. It's not… sharp pain, like an infection, more like… when you’re on a plane, you know? That pressure. But it hasn’t gone away. And it’s not from a plane, obviously. I haven't been on one in… a long time.
DOCTOR: So, constant fullness, bilateral… no pain, just pressure. Any dizziness or ringing in your ears?
PATIENT: Ringing… hmm. Sometimes, yes. A faint ringing. It’s… not constant, though. Comes and goes. And dizziness… no, not really. Maybe a little unsteady sometimes, but I put that down to… well, I’m not as young as I used to be. Does that make sense? It’s hard to explain. It’s not a spinning dizziness, just… off balance.
DOCTOR: “Off balance.” When you say off balance, Mr. Guerrerolopez, are we talking every now and then, or is this a consistent issue?
PATIENT: No, no, not consistent. Just… occasionally. Like when I stand up too fast, maybe. Or if I’m really tired. Nothing… dramatic. I don’t fall over or anything. It's just… a little wobble. Honestly, I probably shouldn't have even mentioned it. It’s probably just old age catching up with me. Sorry to bother you with it.
DOCTOR: Right. So, intermittent ringing, occasional mild imbalance… Have you noticed any hearing loss with this?
PATIENT: Hearing loss… yes, maybe. I have to ask people to repeat themselves sometimes. My wife used to say I was always pretending not to hear her. But seriously, I think it’s gotten a little worse. Especially with… quieter sounds. Like birds chirping. I used to love hearing the birds. It's hard to explain, but… things just sound muffled, sometimes.
DOCTOR: Muffled hearing… alright. Let’s see what your records say. Any history of ear infections, exposure to loud noises, or any medications you’re currently taking?
PATIENT: Ear infections… I think I had a few as a kid. Nothing serious, though. Loud noises… I used to work on a farm, so yes, tractors and such. But nothing I thought was damaging. And medications… let me see. I take something for my blood pressure… amlodipine, I think. And a little something for cholesterol. That's all I can think of. I have private insurance, so I see a specialist for that. It’s all a bit of a blur, honestly. Apologies. Do you need the names of the doctors?
DOCTOR: Amlodipine… yes, I see it. And atorvastatin for cholesterol. Okay. Mr. Guerrerolopez, I'm going to need to do a quick examination of your ears. It's fairly standard, and will help me assess the situation. Can you sit up straight for me, please?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Straight… Is that straight enough? I haven't been very good at following directions lately, either. Sorry. Just… get on with it, if you would. I’d like to get this sorted, if possible. The sooner the better.
DOCTOR: Alright. This will just take a moment. Open your mouth, please. Ah… yes. There is some cerumen – earwax – present in both ears. And the tympanic membranes appear… slightly retracted. No signs of infection currently, but the wax is likely contributing to your symptoms. I also notice some mild congestion in the Eustachian tubes. Does swallowing or yawning make the fullness worse?
PATIENT: Swallowing… no, not really. Yawning… maybe a tiny bit. Like a very slight pop, sometimes. But it’s not… dramatic. It’s hard to explain. Everything feels a bit… blocked. Is this… bad? Should I be worried? My wife… she would always know what to do. But I… I’m just lost without her. .
DOCTOR: Mr. Guerrerolopez. Your wife’s passing is a significant loss, and it’s understandable that you're feeling overwhelmed. But we need to focus on your ears right now. The congestion and wax buildup are likely contributing to the pressure and muffled hearing. I'm not overly concerned at this point, but we need to address it. I recommend we start with a cerumen removal. It's a fairly simple procedure. We can do that in the office today. After that, if your symptoms persist, we can consider a referral to an audiologist for further testing. How does that sound?
