DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Skarbek. I'm Dr. Beinborn. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you too. Well, I received a letter… about needing certain shots before… well, a family member is hoping to come visit from overseas. I believe it has something to do with getting a visa, but I’m a bit unclear on exactly which shots are required and what I need to do. I just want to make sure everything is done properly.
DOCTOR: Okay, that makes sense. Visa requirements can definitely be tricky. Let’s take a look… It seems we have your basic vaccination record here. To clarify, is this family member coming from a country with specific vaccination requirements, or was it a general recommendation from the embassy?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. I… honestly, I don't know. My niece is the one handling the paperwork, and she just sent me the list of things I needed to do. She said something about needing proof for the visa application, but she didn't mention the country specifically. Perhaps she’s waiting for approval before telling me the details? I just received the list yesterday, so things are moving quickly. Is there a way to find out which country’s requirements I should be looking at, based on my information?
DOCTOR: Yes, we can certainly try. Do you happen to know where your niece is applying for the visa from?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. She’s applying from… Brazil, I believe. Yes, that’s right. She moved there a few years back for work. I haven't seen her in quite a while, so I mostly get updates through email and phone calls. Does that help at all?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s very helpful. Okay, Brazil… Let’s see. According to the CDC guidelines, for visitors from Brazil, the primary concern is typically Yellow Fever vaccination, depending on the region they’ve traveled to. There are also recommendations for routine vaccinations like tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis. Do you happen to know what regions of Brazil your niece has been in recently?
PATIENT: Oh dear. I… I don’t, no. She doesn’t often mention where she is specifically. She works with computers, so I imagine she travels around a bit for different projects. She's quite busy, you see. Is Yellow Fever something I absolutely need, even if she hasn’t been to a particularly risky area? I've never had that shot before.
DOCTOR: It’s a good question. Without knowing the specific regions she’s visited, it's difficult to say for certain. Yellow Fever is a serious illness, and the risk depends on exposure. Given that you haven't had the vaccination before, and you’re preparing for a visa application, it's generally safer to get it. However, it's not without potential side effects, though they are usually mild. Before we proceed, do you have any allergies or underlying health conditions I should be aware of?
PATIENT: That makes sense. Better safe than sorry, I suppose. No, I don't have any allergies that I know of. And… well, I'm a little bit overweight, but other than that, I'm generally healthy for my age. I walk most days, and I try to eat a balanced diet. My doctor back home always said my blood pressure was a little high, but it was never anything serious enough to require medication. I did have a knee replacement about five years ago, but it healed up very well. Is that something I need to worry about with this shot?
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. The knee replacement is helpful information. While the Yellow Fever vaccine is generally safe, it is a live vaccine, so there's a very small risk of it causing joint pain or inflammation in individuals with pre-existing joint conditions, like a previous replacement. It’s rare, but we want to be cautious. Before we proceed, I'd like to check your blood pressure just to be sure. It's a quick and easy way to assess your current health status. Then, we can discuss whether the Yellow Fever vaccine is the best course of action for you, or if we should consider alternative options. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly reasonable. Checking my blood pressure is a good idea. I appreciate you being so thorough. I just want to make sure everything is done correctly, for both my sake and my niece’s visa application. Please, go ahead.
DOCTOR: Certainly. It’s always best to be cautious. Okay, if you could just extend your arm, please. Alright, your blood pressure is a bit elevated, 142/90. It’s not drastically high, but it's higher than the ideal range. Given this, and your previous history of slightly elevated blood pressure, I’m a little hesitant to administer the Yellow Fever vaccine today. It could potentially exacerbate the issue. Would you mind if we check a quick blood test to rule out any underlying issues?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That doesn’t sound good. A blood test… yes, alright. If that’s what you recommend, then let’s do it. I just hope it doesn’t take too long. I have a phone call with my niece later this afternoon and I’d like to be able to give her an update. What kind of things will the blood test be checking for? And… will it affect whether or not I can get the shot at all?
DOCTOR: It’s understandable to be concerned. The blood test will be a basic metabolic panel, checking your kidney function, electrolytes, and blood sugar levels. It’ll also include a complete blood count to look at your overall blood health. It’s just a standard precaution to ensure you're healthy enough for the vaccine. The results will help us determine if the slightly elevated blood pressure is a temporary issue, or if there's something else going on. If the results are normal, we can re-evaluate the vaccine. If there are any abnormalities, we can discuss alternative options, or refer you to a specialist to get it checked out. It shouldn't necessarily rule it out completely, but it'll give us a clearer picture of your health status. It’ll take about 15-20 minutes to draw the blood, and the results should be back within a couple of hours. Would that work for you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds alright. 15-20 minutes… I can certainly spare that. And a couple of hours for the results… that should give me enough time to talk to my niece. Alright, let’s get it done. Where do we go for the blood test? I must admit, I’m not fond of needles, but I suppose it’s necessary.
DOCTOR: Alright. No worries at all. We have a lab right down the hall, room 203. I'll have a phlebotomist come get you shortly. They are very skilled and efficient, and they will do their best to make you comfortable. I'll also have them check your weight and height, just to get a complete picture. We can discuss the potential side effects and risks of the Yellow Fever vaccine while we wait for the results, once we have a better understanding of your overall health. Just let me know if you feel faint or uncomfortable at any point. We're here to help. Now, let’s get you down to the lab.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your kindness and patience. I do feel a bit anxious, but I trust your judgment. Alright, let’s go. I hope they have comfortable chairs in that lab. This is all a bit overwhelming, to be honest. But I suppose it’s better to be safe than sorry.
DOCTOR: Certainly. It's perfectly normal to feel anxious, especially with something new. I'll walk you down to the lab and make sure you're settled. They do have comfortable chairs, thankfully! And remember, we're just gathering information to make the best decision for your health. We’ll take things one step at a time. Here we are. I’ll let the phlebotomist know you’re here. Don’t hesitate to let them know if you’re feeling uncomfortable at any point.
