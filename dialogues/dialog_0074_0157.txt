DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Dudney. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Reisig. It’s lovely to meet you. To start, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: High blood pressure, like you said. My husband made me come. He’s been worrying. Honestly, I feel fine.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s good that your husband is looking out for you, and it's not uncommon to feel well even with high blood pressure. Sometimes there aren’t any obvious symptoms. To get a better understanding, could you tell me when you first found out about your blood pressure being high?
PATIENT: He took me to that quick clinic, you know, one of those in the strip mall? Last month, I think. Around the 20th, maybe? They just…told me. Didn’t really explain anything. Just said I needed to see a real doctor.
DOCTOR: Okay, a quick clinic visit around the 20th of last month. That’s helpful. And do you happen to remember what your blood pressure reading was at that clinic, if they told you?
PATIENT: No. They just handed me a paper and told me to make an appointment. Numbers and everything. I don’t bother with numbers. My husband probably knows. He handles all that. I just…show up when he tells me to.
DOCTOR: I see. That’s perfectly alright. Your husband’s support is wonderful. Since we're starting fresh, I’d like to get a reading myself to have a baseline. And then we’ll go through a few questions about your health history. Would that be okay with you?
PATIENT: Fine. Just…let’s hurry, alright? I have things to do. This is taking up my whole morning already.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I understand your time is valuable, Ms. Dudney. We’ll try to be as efficient as possible. If you could just sit here and relax your arm, please. It helps to be still and quiet for an accurate reading. I’ll just need a few moments. And while I do that, perhaps you could tell me a little about any medical conditions you might have, or any medications you take regularly?
PATIENT: Nothing. I don’t have anything. My husband says I’m healthy as a horse. I don’t take pills. Never have. He gets worried about everything though. Honestly, he's worse than my grandma.
DOCTOR: Okay, no current medical conditions or medications. That’s good to know. Your blood pressure is reading a bit elevated at 148/92. That is a bit higher than we'd like to see, which is why your husband was right to be concerned. It's not an emergency, but it does warrant further investigation and discussion. Do you have any history of headaches, vision changes, chest pain, or shortness of breath?
PATIENT: No. Like I said, I feel fine. Maybe it was just the quick clinic. Those places are always rushed. They probably didn’t do it right. It’s probably wrong. Honestly, I think you're making a big deal out of nothing.
DOCTOR: I understand your skepticism, Ms. Dudney. It is good to question things, and you're right, sometimes readings can be inaccurate due to the environment or technique. However, a consistently elevated reading, even if we repeat it here, suggests we should explore potential causes. To help me understand what might be going on, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle? What do you mean? I work. I go home. I eat dinner. What kind of question is that? I don’t go skydiving or anything. It’s a normal life. I’m a civil engineering technician, so I’m at a desk a lot. A lot. Sometimes I have to go out to sites, but mostly desk work.
DOCTOR: Okay, a civil engineering technician, primarily desk work. That's helpful. Desk work can sometimes contribute to higher blood pressure. And while it's good you're not engaging in high-risk activities, lifestyle includes things like diet and exercise habits, as well as stress levels. Could you describe what a typical day of eating looks like for you?
PATIENT: Ugh. Here we go. My husband makes most of the meals. He's…health conscious. Lots of vegetables. Chicken, fish sometimes. He tries to get me to eat more salad. I prefer frybread. But he doesn’t let me have it very often. He says it’s bad for my “numbers”. I drink coffee. A lot of coffee. That’s about it.
DOCTOR: Okay, a diet primarily planned by your husband, with an emphasis on healthy options, but a preference for frybread and a significant coffee intake. And regarding exercise, do you engage in any regular physical activity?
PATIENT: No. I told you, I sit at a desk all day. What exercise? Look, I don't have time for all of this. Can't we just give me something to lower the “numbers” and be done with it? I have reports to finish. I'm seriously wasting my whole morning here.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Dudney. It feels like a waste of time when you have other commitments. I want to assure you I’m not trying to make this difficult. But simply prescribing a medication without understanding why your blood pressure is elevated wouldn’t be responsible care. It’s like trying to fix a car without knowing what’s broken. We need to gather a little more information to determine the best approach. Could you tell me if you have any family history of high blood pressure, heart disease, or stroke?
PATIENT: My grandma had something. She was always sick, though. Always complaining. My mom said it was her heart. But she smoked. A lot. I don't smoke. Never have. My dad was fine, I think. He worked construction. Strong as an ox. I don't know. Honestly, I don't keep up with all that family history stuff. It's depressing.
DOCTOR: I understand. Family history can be complex, and it’s not always easy to keep track of. Okay. To help me get a better picture, would you mind if I quickly listen to your heart and lungs and check your pulse?
PATIENT: Fine. Just hurry. I really need to get back to work. This is going to set me back for days. I swear, my boss is going to kill me.
DOCTOR: Your heart sounds regular, but I do hear a slight murmur. It’s not necessarily concerning, but we’ll want to investigate it further. Your lungs are clear. Your pulse is 82 and regular. To get a more complete understanding, I'd like to order some blood tests and an EKG. The blood tests will check your kidney function, cholesterol levels, and other important markers. The EKG will assess your heart’s electrical activity. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Tests? More tests? Seriously? This is ridiculous. Just…fine. Whatever. Just get it over with. But I’m not paying for any of this. My insurance is pretty good, but I don’t want any surprises. And can you please, please explain everything to my husband? I don't understand any of this medical jargon. He’ll want to know all the details. He always does.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Dudney. We will submit everything to your insurance, and we can discuss any potential costs beforehand. I will explain all the results to both you and your husband in plain language. The lab is right down the hall. They'll need a small blood sample. The EKG is quick and painless – it just involves placing some stickers on your chest. While we're waiting for the results, I'd like to discuss some lifestyle modifications that can help lower your blood pressure. Things like reducing salt intake, increasing physical activity, and managing stress. Are you open to discussing those options?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. I already told you, my husband controls all that. He'll be happy to hear you said something. Just…don't tell me to eat more salad. I'm warning you. I'll listen, but don't expect miracles. I like my life the way it is. Now, can I go? I have work to do. .
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Dudney. I understand. We’ll respect your preferences and work with you to find solutions that fit your lifestyle. The lab technician is expecting you. And I’ll have the results sent to you as soon as they are available. Please schedule a follow-up appointment so we can discuss them together. Thank you for your patience. And please, don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. .
