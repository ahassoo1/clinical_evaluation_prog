DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Schaust. I am Dr. Eaddy. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s… it’s a bit difficult to explain. I’ve been feeling weaker, progressively so, over the last few months. And my eyelids… they feel heavy, and they’re drooping a little, I think. It’s becoming quite noticeable, actually.
DOCTOR: Weakness and drooping eyelids… I see. And when you say progressively, can you be a bit more specific?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It started, oh, maybe six months ago? Just feeling a bit more tired than usual after work. I work in facilities management, so it’s a physical job, running around checking things. At first, I just thought I was out of shape. But then it became harder to lift things, and climbing stairs… that’s gotten much tougher. Now, the eyelids… that’s been maybe a month or two. It's just...worsening. It's not sudden, it's just… gradual. Is that clearer? I'm not very good at explaining these things.
DOCTOR: Gradual, yes. Vague, but gradual. Facilities management… a physically demanding profession, as you say. Do you notice this weakness more at certain times of the day?
PATIENT: Yes, actually. It’s definitely worse by the end of the day. Like, in the mornings I feel… okay, not great, but functional. But by the time I finish work, I'm completely wiped out. And the eyelids feel heavier then too. It’s... frustrating. It makes it hard to concentrate, you know? I'm constantly trying to keep them open.
DOCTOR: Concentration difficulties… and the heaviness is correlated with the fatigue. Do you have any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I’ve been a little more irritable, maybe? My ex-wife certainly thinks so, though that's not saying much. And… I’ve had a bit of trouble swallowing sometimes, a feeling like food gets stuck. It doesn’t happen often, but when it does, it’s… unnerving. Oh, and I've been seeing double sometimes, especially when I'm tired, but I thought that was just from strain.
DOCTOR: Irritability, difficulty swallowing, and intermittent diplopia… Interesting. Let’s move on to your medical history, Mr. Schaust. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions previously?
PATIENT: No, not really. I had the usual childhood illnesses – measles, mumps, chickenpox – but nothing serious. No chronic conditions, no surgeries, nothing like that. I’ve always been fairly healthy, to be honest. That’s why this is so… worrying. I don't even take regular medication.
DOCTOR: No significant past medical history… And what about your family?
PATIENT: Well, my mother had… arthritis, I think? And my father… he had high blood pressure, I believe. He passed away a few years ago. Nothing else that I’m aware of, really. It wasn't a particularly close family, to be honest, so I don’t know much about their medical histories.
DOCTOR: I see. Limited family history. Now, before we proceed, Mr. Schaust, I must ask about your lifestyle. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: No, never. I don’t smoke, and I rarely drink. Perhaps a glass of wine with dinner occasionally, but that’s it. I try to eat a reasonably healthy diet, though it’s sometimes difficult with work. Lots of running around and grabbing whatever’s quick. But I'm not a big drinker or smoker.
DOCTOR: Reasonably healthy… Adequate. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I haven’t had any reactions to anything in the past. I can eat anything, take any medication without issue. I've never had to worry about that, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, Mr. Schaust, I’m going to perform a brief physical examination. If you would please sit up straight and follow my instructions. We’ll begin with your neurological function.
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Whatever you need. Just tell me what to do. I’m ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light. Now, can you follow my finger with your eyes without moving your head?
PATIENT: Yes, I can. No problem. Is that alright? Do you see anything strange?
DOCTOR: Eye movements are slightly diminished, but within acceptable limits. Now, I want you to grip my hands as tightly as you can. Let’s assess your strength.
PATIENT: There. Is that alright? It feels a little… weaker than normal, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Strength is diminished bilaterally, particularly in the extremities. Reflexes are…hypoactive. Now, let me listen to your heart and lungs.
PATIENT: Alright. I’m not sure what all this means, but I’m cooperating. It feels a bit strange, being poked and prodded like this, but… I understand you need to do what you need to do.
DOCTOR: Heart sounds are normal. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Given your symptoms and my findings, I suspect a neuromuscular disorder. However, further testing is required to confirm this. I am ordering a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a creatine kinase level. I will also be ordering an electromyography and nerve conduction study.
PATIENT: Okay… a neuromuscular disorder? That sounds… serious. An EMG and nerve conduction study… what does that involve? And how long will it take to get the results? I’m a bit worried now, to be honest. This is all happening very quickly.
DOCTOR: It can be serious, Mr. Schaust, but it is far too early to jump to conclusions. The EMG and nerve conduction study involves inserting small needles into your muscles to measure their electrical activity. It’s mildly uncomfortable, but not dangerous. As for results, it typically takes a few days to a week for the laboratory to process them. I will also be ordering a referral to a neurologist for a more comprehensive evaluation. It's best to have a specialist look at these results. For now, I advise you to avoid strenuous activity and return to the clinic as soon as you receive the results. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: A neurologist… okay. So, more tests, more waiting… It’s a lot to take in. No, I don’t think I have any questions right now. Just… what kind of neuromuscular disorders are we talking about? Is it something… treatable? I know you said it’s early, but… I just want some idea of what I might be facing.
DOCTOR: Mr. Schaust, I understand your anxiety, but speculating without definitive results would be irresponsible. There are numerous possibilities, ranging from relatively benign conditions to more serious neurological disorders. Some are treatable, others are not. The EMG and neurology referral will give us a clearer picture. Focus on getting the tests done and follow up as instructed. I will discuss the results with you in detail once they are available. We will not play hypotheticals at this stage. Do you require a work note?
PATIENT: No, thank you. I… I think I can manage without a work note for now. I just… I appreciate you ordering the tests and seeing a specialist. I suppose that’s all I can do at this point, is wait. Thank you, Doctor. .
DOCTOR: Very well. Please contact my office to schedule your neurology appointment. And do not hesitate to contact us if you experience any worsening of your symptoms. .
