DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Sucich. My name is Dr. Soodeen. It’s a pleasure to meet you. I see you’re here today for a consultation. Can you tell me what brings you in?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you, Doctor Soodeen. Pleasure's all mine. It’s these hiccups, you see. Been going on for… well, a good few days now. Not constant, mind you, but they pop up at the strangest times! It's just… annoying, really. And a bit tiring, to be honest, always jumping.
DOCTOR: I understand. Hiccups for a few days, intermittent but bothersome. Can you tell me a little more about them?
PATIENT: Well, they don't really hurt, not at all. Just… a sudden jerk, you know? Like someone gave my insides a little poke. I’ve tried holding my breath, like my mother always told me to, but that doesn’t seem to be doing much good these days. They seem to happen after I eat, sometimes, but not always. And sometimes just… out of the blue! It's a bit silly, coming to a doctor for hiccups, isn't it? But they're really getting on my nerves.
DOCTOR: It's not silly at all, Ms. Sucich. Any symptom that’s affecting your quality of life is worth looking into. And hiccups that persist for a few days do warrant investigation. You mentioned they sometimes occur after eating – roughly how long after eating do they begin?
PATIENT: Hmm, that’s a good question. Not immediately, no. It’s usually… maybe an hour or so after I finish my meal? Sometimes a little longer, even. It's hard to say exactly, really. I've been trying to pay attention, but then I get distracted… you know how it is! Old age, I suppose. My memory isn't what it used to be, though I can remember things from sixty years ago perfectly fine! It's the now that gets me.
DOCTOR: Approximately an hour after meals, sometimes longer. And you mentioned your memory isn't quite what it used to be. Are you experiencing any other symptoms alongside the hiccups – anything at all, even if it seems unrelated?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think... Well, I've been feeling a little bit… bloated, I suppose. Not painful, just… full, even when I haven't eaten much. And maybe a little bit tired, but that could just be my age, honestly. I have been sleeping alright, though. No trouble there. Oh! And sometimes a little bit of heartburn, but I get that now and then anyway, especially if I have something spicy. Is that important?
DOCTOR: Bloating, some fatigue, occasional heartburn. We'll note all of that. And yes, the heartburn is relevant. Now, can you tell me about your medical history?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, where to begin? Well, I had my gallbladder out years ago, must have been… oh, in the seventies, I think? And I had a bit of trouble with my blood pressure for a while, but it's been pretty good lately, managed with a little pill each morning. Nothing major, really. I haven't been to the hospital for anything serious in… well, a long time. I try to stay healthy, you know? Eat my fruits and vegetables, walk when I can. I used to be a psychiatric aide, so I’m pretty good at taking care of myself, even now. Is that helpful? And I take a vitamin D supplement, the doctor told me my levels were a bit low.
DOCTOR: Gallbladder removal in the seventies, managed hypertension, vitamin D supplement, and you take medication for your blood pressure. Do you recall the name of that medication, Ms. Sucich?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think... It’s a little white pill... and the name… hmm. It’s on the tip of my tongue! I fill it every month at the pharmacy, but I don't always pay attention to the name. I just tell them to give me my usual. Let me see... I think it starts with an 'A'? Am-… amlodipine? Is that right? Or something like that. It’s terrible, isn’t it? I should know these things, being in the medical field myself. Old age, again.
DOCTOR: Amlodipine, that’s helpful. And you mentioned being a psychiatric aide. Are there any allergies we should be aware of – to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of! I've never had a bad reaction to anything, thankfully. I used to eat all sorts of things when I was younger, and I never had a problem. I’ve been around a lot of different medications in my job, too, and I’ve never noticed any allergies in myself. Not even to shellfish, which some people have trouble with. I love a good prawn curry, you see! No, I don't think I have any allergies at all. I'm quite lucky, really.
DOCTOR: No known allergies. Alright, Ms. Sucich, I'd like to do a quick physical exam now, if you don't mind. Just listening to your heart and lungs, feeling your abdomen, and checking your reflexes. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. I haven't had a proper check-up in a while, so it'll be good to see what's going on. Just let me know if anything feels uncomfortable, alright? I'm not a stranger to medical things, you see. Being an aide, I’ve seen plenty of them.
DOCTOR: Wonderful. If you could please sit up on the examination table, that would be great. Take a deep breath in… and out… good. Heart sounds are regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs auscultated. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Any tenderness here?
PATIENT: No, not really. It feels a little… full, maybe? Like I said, I’ve been a bit bloated lately. But no sharp pains or anything like that. Just a bit uncomfortable, really. Oh, there… that's a little tender. Just there, on the left side. It's not painful, exactly, but… noticeable. Is that normal?
DOCTOR: A bit of tenderness on the left side. Noted. No guarding or rebound tenderness. Bowel sounds are present in all four quadrants. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. Just relax your arm for me… good. Reflexes are 2+ and equal bilaterally. Alright, Ms. Sucich. Everything seems generally within normal limits. The tenderness on your left side is something we’ll keep in mind.
PATIENT: Oh, that's good to hear, even with the tenderness. I was worried it might be something serious. What do you think is causing the hiccups, then? And what about this bloating? It’s just… annoying, really, and I’m tired of feeling full all the time. Is it my age, do you think? Or something else? I just want to feel like myself again.
DOCTOR: Well, Ms. Sucich, persistent hiccups can have a number of causes, ranging from relatively benign to more complex. Given your age and the associated bloating and tenderness, a few possibilities come to mind. It's unlikely to be solely age-related, though that can certainly contribute to slower digestion and some discomfort. We need to rule out a few things before we can pinpoint the exact cause. I'd like to order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel – that checks your kidney and liver function, electrolytes – and a stool test to rule out any infection. We’ll also consider a CT scan of your abdomen and pelvis, just to get a clearer look at your organs and rule out anything unusual, given the tenderness you described. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That sounds like a lot of tests! But… alright. If that’s what you think is best, Doctor, then I trust your judgment. I just want to figure out what’s going on. A CT scan sounds a bit scary, though. Will it hurt? And how long will it take to get the results? I’ve got a bridge club meeting next week, and I wouldn’t want to miss that! I’m not a fan of being poked and prodded, you see. But I’ll do whatever it takes to get rid of these hiccups and feel better.
DOCTOR: I understand your apprehension, Ms. Sucich. A CT scan is non-invasive – you’ll lie on a table, and a scanner will take images. It doesn’t involve any needles or discomfort, though you will need to lie still for a short period. The entire process usually takes about 20-30 minutes. As for the results, we should have them back within a few days, hopefully before your bridge club meeting. I’m also going to prescribe you a medication called Reglan, which can help with the hiccups and nausea. It sometimes causes drowsiness as a side effect, so be careful driving or operating machinery. We'll start with a low dose and see how you tolerate it. I'll also have the nurse schedule you for a follow-up appointment in one week to discuss the results and how you’re feeling. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh, that sounds… alright, I suppose. A little bit overwhelming, but alright. Reglan, you say? I’ll be careful with the driving, definitely. I mostly just putter around these days, but still. And one week… that's good. I'm glad we’re getting things sorted out. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very thorough. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me. It’s nice to have someone explain things so clearly. I suppose I should go get these tests done then. Will the nurse call me to schedule everything?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Sucich. I'm glad I could help. Yes, the nurse will call you within the next day or two to schedule the tests and the follow-up appointment. In the meantime, if you experience any worsening symptoms – severe abdominal pain, vomiting, or fever – please don't hesitate to call the office immediately. Do you have any other questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No, I think that's everything, Doctor. You’ve been very kind and helpful. I feel much better knowing we’re getting to the bottom of this. Thank you again. I’ll let you get back to your patients now. And I'll call if anything changes.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Sucich. Please don't hesitate to reach out if you do. Have a good day, and I look forward to seeing you next week. .
