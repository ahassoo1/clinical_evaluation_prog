DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Shaub. I'm Dr. Duplichan. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, to be frank, I came in to ask about getting tested for… for HIV. It's something I've been thinking about for a little while now, and I'd just like to know my status, if you don't mind.
DOCTOR: Alright. That's… sensible, I suppose. It's always better to know. And what prompted you to consider getting tested at this time, Ms. Shaub?
PATIENT: Hmm. Well, it's not one specific thing, really. Just… general awareness, you know? I've been hearing more about it, seeing things in the news. And honestly, I haven’t been tested before, and at my age, I think it's a good idea to just be sure. It’s just… preventative, I suppose. My husband and I… we’ve been together a long time, but it’s always best to be careful, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: Preventative care is certainly commendable. Though, if you’ve been in a mutually faithful, long-term relationship, the risk is… statistically lower. Still, you are right to consider your peace of mind. To be thorough, I need to ask a few questions. Have you ever had any blood transfusions?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. A good many years ago, when I was recovering from a very difficult childbirth. I believe it was… 1983, perhaps? And… another one, a smaller one, after a car accident in ‘95. Both times at the local hospital, of course. Does that matter? I don’t remember anything specific about the blood itself, just that I needed them.
DOCTOR: Yes, that does matter, Ms. Shaub. Blood transfusions prior to widespread screening pose a very small risk. Now, have you ever shared needles for any reason – for recreational drug use, tattoos, piercings, or anything of that nature?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no. Never. I’ve never… indulged in recreational drugs, and any tattoos or piercings I’ve ever had were done with brand new needles, at reputable establishments, I assure you. I wouldn’t risk anything like that. My mother raised me better than that.
DOCTOR: Of course. Just routine questions, Ms. Shaub. Now, let’s move on to sexual history. I understand this can be sensitive, but it's important for accurate risk assessment. Have you ever had unprotected sexual intercourse with anyone other than your husband?
PATIENT: Oh. Well… that’s… a personal question, isn’t it? But… no. Not since I’ve been married. I've been with my husband for… almost forty years now. We’ve always been very careful. We've always used protection when… when necessary. This is a bit… intrusive, Doctor. I came in to get a test, not to have my life scrutinized.
DOCTOR: I understand your discomfort, Ms. Shaub. However, these questions are not about scrutiny, but about ensuring the most accurate assessment of your risk. While a long-term, monogamous relationship significantly reduces risk, complete certainty requires a thorough understanding of past exposures. Now, have you ever had any sexually transmitted infections – STIs – diagnosed?
PATIENT: No, never. I've always been very healthy, thankfully. And, as I said, very careful. My husband and I… we both take our health very seriously. We’ve never had reason to suspect anything like that, not ever. I’m starting to feel a little… uncomfortable with all these questions, Doctor. Is this test… is this going to involve a blood draw? Perhaps we can just get on with that.
DOCTOR: A blood draw is indeed necessary, Ms. Shaub. And while I appreciate your assurances, it’s my professional responsibility to gather a complete history. But very well. Let’s proceed. Before we do, do you have any allergies to latex, alcohol, or any other materials commonly used in medical procedures?
PATIENT: No, thankfully not. I have no allergies that I'm aware of. No reactions to any medicines or… or anything like that. I’ve always been rather fortunate in that regard. I just… I’d like to get this over with, if you don’t mind, Doctor. It's making me a bit anxious, all these questions.
DOCTOR: Very well. We will proceed with the blood draw. I'll need to disinfect the area on your arm, then insert the needle. It will be a quick pinch, and then we'll collect the sample. Please let me know if you feel any discomfort. Now, I need to ask one final question. Do you have any existing medical conditions I should be aware of, such as diabetes or autoimmune disorders?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Well… my blood pressure has been a little high lately. The doctor put me on medication for it, just a small dose. And… I have some arthritis in my hands, but it's not too bad, just a little stiffness in the mornings. Other than that… no, nothing major. Is that important?
DOCTOR: High blood pressure is relevant, Ms. Shaub, as it can sometimes affect test results. Now, what medication are you taking for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: It’s… let me think. Lisinopril, I believe. A small dose, just ten milligrams, once a day. I’ve been taking it for… oh, about six months now, perhaps? It seems to be keeping it under control, thankfully. My husband reminds me to take it every morning.
DOCTOR: Alright. Thank you, Ms. Shaub. That’s all the information I require for now. I'm going to proceed with the blood draw. Please relax your arm. This may sting for a moment.
PATIENT: Okay. Just… please be quick, Doctor. I don't like needles.
DOCTOR: Just a quick pinch… and done. Alright, all finished. Apply pressure to the site for a few minutes to prevent bruising. I'll have the lab run a standard HIV antibody test, as well as a complete blood count to monitor your overall health, given your blood pressure medication. The results should be available in approximately one to two weeks. We will contact you with the results as soon as they are available. Do you have any questions for me before you leave?
PATIENT: One to two weeks? That seems a long time. Is there anything I should be doing in the meantime? And… what if it is positive? What happens then?
DOCTOR: The timeframe is standard for lab processing, Ms. Shaub. It allows for accurate results. As for what if the result is positive… that is unlikely, given your history, but if it were to be, we would discuss treatment options immediately. HIV is a manageable condition with modern medication. We would refer you to an infectious disease specialist for ongoing care. It's important to remember that a positive result does not equal an immediate crisis. There are effective therapies available, and with proper management, individuals with HIV can live long and healthy lives. However, it’s best not to borrow trouble. Focus on the possibility of a negative result, and we will address any concerns should they arise. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, I… I think so. It's just… a lot to take in. And waiting… waiting is always the hardest part. I suppose there's nothing else to do but wait, then. Thank you, Doctor. For… for everything. I’ll just… go and wait for the call, then. .
DOCTOR: Very well. We will be in touch, Ms. Shaub. And please, try not to worry unduly. .
