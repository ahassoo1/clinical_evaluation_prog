DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Stepbro. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Alanes. It’s nice to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you too. Well… this is a bit difficult to explain. I’ve been having some… discomfort. Down there. It’s in… my testicles, I think is the word? It's been going on for a little while now, but it’s become more noticeable lately. I'm not quite sure why it's happening.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Stepbro. It's perfectly alright to discuss these things, and you're doing the right thing by coming in. “Discomfort” is a good way to start. To help me understand what’s going on, could you describe the discomfort a little more?
PATIENT: Hmm… well, it’s not a sharp pain, exactly. More of a… dull ache, I suppose. And sometimes it feels… heavy? Like a weight is pulling down. It doesn’t happen all the time, but it’s most noticeable after I’ve been… working. You know, with the wood. It’s hard to explain… I don't really feel pain the way other people do, if that makes sense. I just… notice things are off.
DOCTOR: I understand. “Off” is a helpful description, and it's not uncommon for people to experience pain differently. You mentioned you work with wood – is that a physically demanding job?
PATIENT: Yes, it is, Doctor. Very much so. A lot of lifting, bending, and… well, just generally being on my feet all day. I build furniture mostly, and sometimes do restorations. It’s… it’s always been my passion, but it’s not always kind to my body. I try to be careful, but accidents happen. I haven't had any major injuries recently, if that's what you're asking. Just the usual aches and pains.
DOCTOR: Okay, so physically demanding work with lifting and bending. That’s helpful information. And no recent major injuries. Have you noticed any swelling or redness in the area, along with this ache and heaviness?
PATIENT: Swelling… hmm. I don’t think so. It’s hard to say, honestly. I don’t usually… look down there, if you understand. Redness… no, I haven’t noticed any redness either. But then again, I haven't specifically been looking for it. It might be there and I just haven’t seen it. My vision isn’t what it used to be, you see.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Ms. Stepbro. It’s not something everyone routinely checks. No worries at all. And it’s good you mention your vision. Let’s do a quick physical exam, if you're comfortable with that, just to get a better idea of what’s going on. I'll need to gently examine the area. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible, Doctor. I trust your judgement. If you think it’s necessary, then please do. It’s just… a little embarrassing, if I’m honest. But I want to figure out what's causing this discomfort. I’ve been avoiding it for too long, I think.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. It’s perfectly normal to feel a little embarrassed, and I will do my best to make you comfortable. I’ll explain everything as I go, and you can stop me at any time if you feel uncomfortable. If you could lie down on the table for me, that would be great. I'll start by listening to your abdomen and then gently palpate the area. Please let me know if anything feels particularly tender or painful. Okay, I’m just listening now… and now feeling gently. Any discomfort here?
PATIENT: Okay… yes, a little. Right… about there. Not a sharp pain, but a… pressure. Like something is… full. It’s hard to explain. And… yes, a little bit when you press right… there. It's not terrible, but I can feel it. It’s definitely more sensitive there than anywhere else.
DOCTOR: Okay, I’m noting that tenderness. And I do feel a slight fullness in that area. Is it constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It comes and goes, Doctor. It's worse after I’ve been working, like I said. After a long day of lifting and bending, it feels quite noticeable. But when I'm resting, it’s usually not so bad. Sometimes it feels like it's a little… swollen in the morning, but then it goes down as the day goes on, even if I have been working. It’s… a little strange, really. It doesn’t follow a consistent pattern.
DOCTOR: Okay, I'm checking your testicles now. Are you experiencing any pain or discomfort with this?
PATIENT: Yes… a little. Not a sharp pain, but… awareness. I can feel your touch. The left one feels… slightly more tender than the right, I think. Not a lot, but just… a little different. And… yes, there's something… small. I can't say for sure, but it feels like a small lump, maybe? On the left one. But it’s very small. I’ve probably just never noticed it before. I’m not very good at… self-exams, if you know what I mean.
DOCTOR: Okay, I do feel a small lump on the left testicle. It’s quite small, and it doesn’t feel particularly hard. But it’s definitely there. And you’re right, it's not as prominent on the right side. Based on what you’ve described and what I’ve found during the exam, it’s difficult to say definitively what’s going on, Ms. Stepbro. It could be a number of things. It’s possible it’s a spermatocele – a fluid-filled cyst that’s relatively common and often harmless. It could also be a varicocele – enlarged veins within the scrotum. However, because there is a lump present, we need to rule out other possibilities, including a potential testicular torsion or, less commonly, a testicular tumor. To get a clearer picture, I would like to order a scrotal ultrasound. This is a non-invasive imaging test that can help us visualize the structures within your scrotum and determine the exact nature of the lump. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: An ultrasound… yes, that sounds sensible. If you think it’s necessary, then please do. I just want to know what’s going on. It’s been bothering me for a while now, and I’d feel much better if we could get some answers. I understand you need to rule things out, and I trust your judgement. A tumor… that sounds scary. But I suppose it’s better to know, one way or another. Yes, please, order the ultrasound. When can I schedule it?
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. Stepbro. It’s perfectly natural to be anxious when you hear the word “tumor.” But it's important to remember that the vast majority of testicular lumps are benign. We’re simply being thorough. I’ve ordered the ultrasound for you. The radiology department will call you to schedule an appointment. They're usually quite quick to get people in, I expect you'll be able to get it done within the next few days. In the meantime, I would like you to avoid any strenuous activity, especially lifting heavy objects, until we have the results of the ultrasound. I’ll also prescribe you some over-the-counter pain relief, such as ibuprofen or naproxen, if you’re experiencing any discomfort. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No strenuous activity… yes, I can manage that. Ibuprofen is fine, I have some at home. Um… will the ultrasound be… painful? And… how long will it take to get the results? I suppose I’m mostly worried about… waiting. And… is there anything else I should be looking out for, while I’m waiting? Any symptoms I should report immediately?
DOCTOR: That's a very good question, Ms. Stepbro. The ultrasound itself is not painful at all. It uses sound waves to create an image, so it’s completely non-invasive. It might feel a little cold as the technician applies the gel, but that's it. As for the results, it usually takes about 24-48 hours for the radiologist to send the report to me. I will call you as soon as I have them. In the meantime, I would like you to monitor for any sudden, severe pain or swelling in your scrotum. If you experience any fever, nausea, or vomiting, please contact me immediately or go to the nearest emergency room. Also, any change in the size or consistency of the lump should be reported to me right away. We're being cautious, Ms. Stepbro. Most likely, this will turn out to be nothing serious, but it’s always best to rule things out. Do you have any other concerns or questions?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. Thank you, Doctor Alanes. You’ve been very helpful, and you’ve explained everything very clearly. I appreciate your patience and your… thoroughness. I’ll try not to worry too much, and I’ll contact you immediately if anything changes. Thank you again. Have a good day.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Stepbro. I’m glad I could help. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns, even if it's just to check in. I will be in touch as soon as the results of the ultrasound are available. Have a good day as well, and try to relax. .
