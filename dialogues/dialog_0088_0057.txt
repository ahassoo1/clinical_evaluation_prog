DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Chellsea. I’m Dr. Piet. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor. Well, it’s… about the cancer. I was told to come speak with you. I’m still trying to understand everything, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay. I understand that can be a lot to process. And it's good you're here to talk about it. Just to clarify, you were recently informed of a cancer diagnosis?
PATIENT: Yes, that is right. Recently. It was… a shock. And I don’t really know what questions to ask, if that makes sense. Everything happened so fast.
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense. It’s very common to feel overwhelmed after receiving news like that. Let’s take it one step at a time. Do you happen to know what type of cancer it is?
PATIENT: Um… I think they said… something about the lungs? It was a very fast appointment, and I was… upset. I don’t recall the exact words. I apologize. It all felt like a blur.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all. That's perfectly understandable. Okay, lung cancer. And do you know if they mentioned what stage it is, or if they did any scans like a CT scan or biopsy?
PATIENT: They did a scan, yes. A big one. And something about… taking a small piece. A biopsy, I think that’s what they called it. As for the stage… I don’t believe they said. I was mostly told I needed to see you for a treatment plan. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. Okay. Let me pull up your records here. Ah, yes. It says here you had a CT scan on July 18th, and a biopsy was performed on July 22nd. The pathology report indicates non-small cell lung cancer. It doesn't specify a stage yet, which is common – staging often requires more information. Before we talk about treatment, I'd like to get a more detailed picture of your overall health and your symptoms. Have you been experiencing any cough, shortness of breath, chest pain, or any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Yes, I have been coughing. A lot, actually. More than usual. It started a few months ago, I thought it was just a bad cold, but it hasn’t gone away. And sometimes… sometimes I feel winded, just walking up the stairs. No chest pain, though. Not really.
DOCTOR: Okay, a persistent cough for a few months and shortness of breath with exertion. Good to know. Has the cough been producing any mucus?
PATIENT: Yes, it does. Sometimes it’s clear, and other times… it's a bit… yellow. It’s not a lot, but it’s there. I try not to think about it too much. Is that… important?
DOCTOR: It is important, yes. The color and amount of mucus can give us some clues. And how often are you noticing this yellow mucus?
PATIENT: It's… more frequent lately. Maybe the last week or so. Before that, it was mostly clear. Not every day, but… several times a week. It’s hard to explain. It just depends, I suppose. I feel like I'm rambling.
DOCTOR: No, you're not rambling at all. That's helpful information. Do you have any fever, chills, or night sweats?
PATIENT: No, no fever. Not that I’ve noticed. No chills, either. And I haven’t had night sweats. I sleep pretty normally, thankfully. That's one thing that hasn't changed.
DOCTOR: Good. Now, have you ever smoked, or been exposed to a lot of secondhand smoke?
PATIENT: No, I have never smoked. And I try to stay away from it when others are. My husband… he smoked for a long time, but he passed away last year. So, I haven’t been around it much since then. It’s a bad habit, I always thought.
DOCTOR: I'm very sorry to hear about your husband. That must have been very difficult. Okay, so no smoking history and limited exposure to secondhand smoke. Let's talk about your medical history. Do you have any other health conditions, like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: No, I don't. I’ve always been fairly healthy, to be honest. Just the usual colds and flus, nothing serious. My husband was the one with health problems, not me. I kept telling him he needed to see a doctor.
DOCTOR: I understand. And do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I’ve taken different things over the years for colds, and I’ve never had a reaction. I don't take any regular medications, either. Just… over-the-counter things when I need them.
DOCTOR: Okay. That's good to know. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if you’re comfortable with that. I'll listen to your lungs, check your heart rate, and feel for any swollen lymph nodes. It’ll just take a few minutes.
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I'm ready.
DOCTOR: Okay. Okay, your pulse is a bit elevated, but that could be due to anxiety, which is very common in this situation. Your lungs… I hear some diminished breath sounds in the lower lobes of both lungs, and some mild wheezing. And I feel a slightly enlarged lymph node on the right side of your neck, but it's not significantly large. I think it would be prudent to get a chest X-ray to get a better view of your lungs and see if we can determine the extent of the findings. And I’d also like to order a complete blood count to check for any signs of infection or anemia. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds alright. Whatever you need to do. X-ray and the blood test. I just… want to know what’s going on. Is it bad? Is it… treatable? I'm sorry. I'm probably asking too much.
DOCTOR: You’re not asking too much at all. Those are perfectly valid questions, and I understand your anxiety. It's too early to say definitively how serious it is or what the treatment options might be without the results of the additional tests. However, non-small cell lung cancer is often treatable, especially when caught early. Treatment options can include surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, targeted therapy, and immunotherapy, or a combination of these. Let me write up the orders for the X-ray and CBC. The lab is right down the hall, and the radiology department is on the second floor. Once we have the results, we can schedule another appointment to discuss them in detail and develop a treatment plan. In the meantime, if you experience any worsening symptoms, such as severe shortness of breath, chest pain, or a high fever, please go to the emergency room immediately. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good. I will. I'll get the tests done. And I will go to the emergency room if things get worse. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you explaining everything. I’m just… scared.
DOCTOR: It's perfectly understandable to be scared, Chellsea. It’s a frightening situation. Please know that we're here to support you every step of the way. We’ll work together to get you the best possible care. Do you have any questions for me right now before you go get your tests?
PATIENT: No… not right now, I think. I need to… process everything. Thank you again, Doctor Piet. For your time and for explaining things so clearly. I'll see you when the results are back.
DOCTOR: Okay, Chellsea. You take your time. And remember, don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns. We’re here for you. Take care.
