DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Redeye. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Quicksey. It’s nice to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. It's nice to meet you as well. Well, it's these hiccups. They just… won't stop. Started a couple of days ago, and they're still going strong. More than 48 hours, definitely. It's quite annoying, really.
DOCTOR: I understand. Persistent hiccups can be very disruptive. More than 48 hours is certainly long enough to warrant a look. To get a better understanding of what’s going on, could you tell me a little more about them?
PATIENT: Oh, absolutely. Let me think… They come and go, you know? Not a regular rhythm or anything. Sometimes just one, sometimes a little burst of three or four. Nothing seems to cause them, which is the weirdest part. I haven’t changed my diet, haven’t done anything unusual… I was just sitting and reading, and hic – there they started. And they’ve been with me ever since. Do you need to know where it feels like they're coming from? Because I can tell you exactly… it's right here, .
DOCTOR: That’s helpful to know, Ms. Redeye. Localizing the sensation is good information. It sounds like they’re originating from your chest, as you describe. And you haven’t noticed any triggers at all – no specific foods, drinks, or activities that seem to make them worse or better?
PATIENT: No, nothing at all. I've been trying to think, racking my brain, because everyone always says "what did you do?" or "what did you eat?" But honestly? Just normal stuff. I had my usual tea this morning, a little toast… I even tried holding my breath, you know, like you’re supposed to, but that didn’t do a thing. Maybe made them worse, actually. And drinking water quickly doesn’t help either. It just… makes me wet.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration. It’s good you’ve already tried some common remedies. Holding your breath and drinking water quickly are often the first suggestions. Since they’ve persisted for over 48 hours despite these attempts, we should explore some other possibilities. To help me get a broader picture, could you tell me about any other symptoms you’ve been experiencing?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… Hmm. Let me think. I haven’t felt sick, no fever or chills. No heartburn, no indigestion. I've been a little tired lately, but I always am, to be honest. I'm 50, Doctor! My stomach's been alright. And no pain anywhere, besides maybe a little discomfort from all the… well, the hic – the hiccups themselves. They make my chest muscles a bit sore, if I’m being truthful. But nothing else really. Oh! I did feel a little… shaky yesterday afternoon, but that passed quickly. I just thought I hadn't eaten enough.
DOCTOR: Okay, no fever, chills, heartburn, indigestion, no significant pain… occasional tiredness and a brief episode of shakiness. The shakiness is good to note. Has this shakiness happened before?
PATIENT: Not really. I mean, I get tired, as I said, but not… shaky. It was just for a little while, like my hands were trembling. It wasn’t bad, just… noticeable. I was making tea, actually, and I spilled a little. It was after lunch, I think. And it went away pretty quickly, like within half an hour. I didn’t think much of it at the time, honestly. Just assumed I needed a snack. It's hard to tell what's normal at my age, you know? Everything aches eventually.
DOCTOR: That’s fair. It’s good to be thorough, though. Now, let's talk a little about your medical history. Do you have any current medical conditions that you're aware of?
PATIENT: Well, let me see… I had my gallbladder out years ago, probably twenty years now. And I’ve got a bit of high blood pressure, but it’s controlled with medication. I take a small dose every day. Otherwise, I'm pretty healthy, all things considered. No diabetes, no heart problems… nothing major. Oh! And I used to have terrible migraines, but they’ve been gone for years, thank goodness. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful, Ms. Redeye. Gallbladder removal, controlled hypertension, and a history of migraines. Do you remember the name of the medication you take for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Yes, I do. It's… let me see… Lisinopril. Yes, Lisinopril. 10 milligrams, once a day. I’ve been on it for… oh, goodness, probably ten years now. It keeps things nice and stable, thankfully. I haven’t had any problems with it, no side effects or anything. I make sure to take it every morning with my tea.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Lisinopril 10mg daily. And have you had any surgeries other than your gallbladder removal?
PATIENT: No, just the gallbladder. Nothing else. No broken bones, no appendix out… nothing. I’ve been pretty lucky, all things considered. I try to stay active, you know? I walk every day, and I do a little gardening. Nothing strenuous, but it keeps me moving. Oh! I did have a wisdom tooth out when I was young, but that doesn’t really count, does it? It was ages ago.
DOCTOR: No, a wisdom tooth removal doesn’t really factor into our discussion. Now, could you tell me about any medications you’re currently taking, besides the Lisinopril?
PATIENT: Just the Lisinopril, Doctor. Honestly, that’s it. I don't like taking pills if I can avoid it. I tried some over-the-counter heartburn medication a few times, but it didn't really help, so I stopped. And occasionally I'll take a pain reliever for a headache, but that's maybe once or twice a year. Nothing regular. I pride myself on not being a medicine person.
DOCTOR: Okay, just Lisinopril, occasional pain reliever. And do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything. I eat all sorts of things, and I’ve never had a problem. I’m not particularly sensitive, thankfully. I’ve seen enough allergies in my family, I don't need any! My cousin, bless her heart, is allergic to everything under the sun. But me? I'm pretty lucky, as usual.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. Now, just a few questions about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… My mother had diabetes, type 2, later in life. And my father had heart problems, high blood pressure, like me. My brother’s perfectly healthy, thankfully. And my sister… she had some trouble with her thyroid, but it was treated successfully. Oh! And my grandmother on my mother’s side, she had arthritis, badly. It crippled her hands. Is that helpful? It's a long family, you know, lots of branches.
DOCTOR: That's very helpful, Ms. Redeye. Diabetes, hypertension, thyroid issues, and arthritis. Now, could you tell me a little about your social history?
PATIENT: Oh, social history... Well, I'm divorced, been divorced for about fifteen years now. No children, never had any. I live alone in a small house in the suburbs. I have a few friends, mostly from my book club, and I see them occasionally. I enjoy reading, gardening, and walking, as I mentioned. And I love my tea! It's a quiet life, but it's a good life. I don't smoke, and I rarely drink alcohol – maybe a glass of wine with dinner once a month. Is that what you were looking for?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's perfect, Ms. Redeye. A quiet, healthy lifestyle. Now, before we proceed, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. It will just involve listening to your heart and lungs, checking your abdomen, and taking your blood pressure. It should only take a few minutes. Do you have any concerns about that?
PATIENT: No, not at all, Doctor. That sounds perfectly fine. Go ahead. I'm used to doctor visits, unfortunately. Getting old isn't for the faint of heart, you know? I'll just sit here and relax. Let me know if I need to do anything special.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Please just relax and breathe normally. I'm going to start by listening to your heart and lungs with my stethoscope. Okay, your blood pressure is 138/82, which is a little elevated but not drastically so. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Your abdomen is soft and non-tender, though I do feel some mild muscular discomfort in your chest, as you described. Your pulse is 72 and regular. There are no visible signs of distress. Now, based on everything you’ve told me and the brief physical exam, it's unlikely there's a serious underlying cause for your hiccups. However, persistent hiccups can sometimes be a sign of something more going on. To be on the safe side, I'd like to order a couple of simple blood tests – a complete blood count and a basic metabolic panel – to rule out any electrolyte imbalances or underlying medical conditions. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: That sounds sensible, Doctor. If it puts my mind at ease, then yes, absolutely. Blood tests are fine. I'd rather be safe than sorry, especially with these hiccups dragging on so long. It's just… exhausting, you know? So, just let me know what I need to do. Do I need to fast before the tests? And where will they be done?
DOCTOR: Yes, you will need to fast for at least eight hours before the blood draw. That means no food or sugary drinks, but you can drink water. The tests can be done at the lab here at the clinic, just down the hall. I’ll write you a lab order with specific instructions. While we’re waiting for the results, I’d like to recommend trying a few more hiccup remedies. Have you tried holding a spoonful of sugar under your tongue?
PATIENT: Oh, I’ve heard of that one! No, I haven't. I was always a bit skeptical, to be honest. Sounds a bit… old wives’ tale-ish. But I suppose it's worth a try, isn’t it? Anything's worth a try at this point. What else have you got? I've tried breathing into a paper bag before, but that made me dizzy. And holding my breath just doesn’t seem to do anything. I feel like I’ve tried everything! But alright, I’ll give the sugar a go. Tell me what else.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration. Breathing into a paper bag isn’t always the best approach, especially if you feel dizzy. Besides the spoonful of sugar, you could try sipping ice water slowly. Sometimes, stimulating the vagus nerve can help. You can do that by gargling with water for 30 seconds. Given your history of controlled hypertension and the persistence of the hiccups, I also want to rule out any potential medication side effects, though Lisinopril is not commonly associated with hiccups. We'll keep that in mind. I’ll call you with the results of the blood tests as soon as they're available, likely within 24-48 hours. In the meantime, please continue to monitor your symptoms. If you experience any new or worsening symptoms, such as difficulty breathing, chest pain, or severe abdominal pain, please seek immediate medical attention. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything, Doctor. That's a lot of good information. Gargling… I haven’t tried that one either! I'll give it a shot. I appreciate you being so thorough. It's reassuring to know you're taking this seriously. And thank you for explaining everything so clearly. I’ll wait for your call. Hopefully, those tests will give us some answers. And I’ll try to avoid spilling tea in the meantime.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Redeye. That’s what I’m here for. And I appreciate your patience. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any concerns before I call with the results. We’ll get to the bottom of this. Have a good day, and try to rest.
PATIENT: .
