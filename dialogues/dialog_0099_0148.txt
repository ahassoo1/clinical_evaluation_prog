DOCTOR: Right. Noelani Stepno, 44 years old. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, um... it’s a bit difficult to explain. It’s… pain. Down there. In… well, the groin area, I suppose. It started a few days ago, and it’s… uncomfortable. I don’t usually come to the doctor, so I’m not very good at describing things.
DOCTOR: Uncomfortable, alright. “Down there” and in the groin area... a few days ago. Can you be a bit more specific about the pain itself?
PATIENT: Specific… hmm. It’s not a sharp pain, exactly. More of a… dull ache? And it comes and goes. Sometimes it’s worse when I… walk. Or stand for a long time. I honestly can’t recall exactly when it started, just that it’s been a few days. My memory isn't what it used to be, unfortunately.
DOCTOR: Dull ache, comes and goes, worse with walking or standing... that narrows things down a bit, though not terribly. And you said a few days – is that more like two days, or closer to a week?
PATIENT: Oh dear… I truly can’t say for certain. It feels… longer than two days, but I haven’t been keeping track. Perhaps closer to a week? It all feels a bit blurry, I apologize. I mostly just tried to ignore it, hoping it would go away on its own.
DOCTOR: Alright. We’ll work with “about a week.” Has this pain been accompanied by any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… let me think. I don’t think so. No fever, no… swelling that I’ve noticed. Everything looks normal, if that makes sense. Just the ache. Oh, and maybe a little… heaviness? Down there. But it could just be my imagination.
DOCTOR: No fever, no swelling, just the ache and a feeling of heaviness. And you said this hasn't been happening before?
PATIENT: No, no, this is new. I’ve never… experienced anything like this before. I’m generally quite healthy, as far as I know. I work with wood mostly, so it’s usually just aches in my hands and back. Nothing… there.
DOCTOR: Alright. And just to get a complete picture, are you sexually active?
PATIENT: Oh… um. Yes. I am. But… this pain didn’t start after anything. It just… appeared. I hope that answers your question. It feels a bit personal, if you don’t mind me saying so.
DOCTOR: It’s a necessary question, Mrs. Stepno. Now, let's move on to your medical history. Do you have any known medical conditions?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see. I have… well, I take medication for my blood pressure. That's about it, I think. And I had my appendix out when I was a child, but that was… a long time ago. I don't really go to the doctor unless absolutely necessary, so I'm not sure if there's anything else. Medicare covers me, if that helps.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure medication… and appendectomy as a child. Any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm. No, I don’t think so. I haven’t had any bad reactions to any medications that I’m aware of. I’m not a particularly allergic person, thankfully. I can eat most things. No hives or anything like that. I really try to avoid anything too processed, if that counts for anything.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, I’m going to need to do a brief physical exam. Nothing invasive, just to get a better understanding of what’s going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. That’s fine. Whatever you need to do. I understand you need to check things to figure out what’s wrong. Please, go ahead. I’m a little nervous, but I trust you.
DOCTOR: Good. If you could lie down on the examination table, please. I’ll start with listening to your abdomen. Normal bowel sounds. No murmurs or bruits. Mild tenderness to palpation in the lower abdominal region, left side. No rebound tenderness. No guarding. External genitalia appears normal. No visible lesions or discharge. Mild tenderness upon internal examination, left adnexal region. No palpable masses. Okay. So, the exam reveals some tenderness in your lower abdomen, particularly on the left side. And a bit of tenderness during the pelvic exam on the left side as well. It’s not severe, but it’s there. It's difficult to say exactly what’s going on without further investigation.
PATIENT: Oh dear. That doesn’t sound good, does it? Further investigation… what does that involve? Is it something serious? I… I don’t really like the sound of that.
DOCTOR: It’s not necessarily serious, Mrs. Stepno, but it warrants further investigation to rule things out. The possibilities range from a muscle strain to something more…involved. I’d like to order a complete blood count, a urinalysis, and a pelvic ultrasound. The ultrasound will give us a better look at your reproductive organs and rule out any cysts or other abnormalities. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, that… that sounds alright. Whatever you think is best. A blood test and an ultrasound… I can do that. Will it be painful? And… how long will it take to get the results? I have a bit of a schedule, you see. I help my neighbor with her garden on Tuesdays.
DOCTOR: The blood test is just a standard draw, a quick pinch. The ultrasound is non-invasive, a technician will apply gel to your abdomen and use a wand to create images. No pain involved. As for the results, the blood work should be back within a couple of days. The ultrasound may take a bit longer, perhaps three to five business days, depending on the availability of the radiologist. We'll need to schedule those. I will have the nurse come in to draw the blood and arrange the ultrasound. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding strenuous activity, and if the pain worsens, you should contact the office immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No strenuous activity… alright, I can manage that. Three to five days… that's… acceptable. Um… yes, actually, I do have a question. Is there anything I should be doing now? To help with the pain, I mean. Can I take something over the counter? And… is it possible this is just a muscle strain? I was bending a lot yesterday, helping my neighbor move some bags of soil.
DOCTOR: You can take ibuprofen or naproxen, following the dosage instructions on the label, for pain relief. Those will also help with any inflammation. And yes, a muscle strain is a possibility, given your activity yesterday. However, we need to rule out other causes first. I'll also write a prescription for a mild pain reliever, just in case the over-the-counter options aren't enough. If the pain does get significantly worse—fever, severe nausea, dizziness, bleeding—go to the emergency room immediately. Understand?
PATIENT: Yes, I understand. Ibuprofen or naproxen, a prescription just in case, and emergency room if it gets worse. Fever, nausea, dizziness, bleeding… I’ll try to remember that. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very helpful. I guess I’ll wait for the nurse, then? And try not to bend too much.
DOCTOR: Yes, wait for the nurse. She’ll be in shortly. And try to rest. We'll get to the bottom of this. .
PATIENT: .
