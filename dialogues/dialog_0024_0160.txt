DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Hardenburgh. I am Dr. Mutnick. Now, let’s not waste any time. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Honestly? It's this tiredness. Just dragging all the time, you know? And… well, it’s embarrassing to even say, but I’ve been… eating dirt. Not a lot, but enough to bother me. I don't know why I'm doing it, but it's getting worse. It's not like I'm out there digging holes or anything. Just… finding little bits.
DOCTOR: Eating dirt, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, dirt. Clay, mostly. From around my garden. I know it's… strange. And probably not healthy. Don't look at me like that, I’m a grown woman. I’ve lived a long life and never needed to explain my cravings to anyone before. It’s just… started happening a few months ago, and now I can’t seem to stop.
DOCTOR: Ms. Hardenburgh, with all due respect, this is… unusual. And frankly, concerning. When did this begin precisely?
PATIENT: Oh, don’t you start with the “concerning” bit. I get enough of that from my niece. Let me think… it was right after that really hot spell we had in May. Yes, May. Maybe the first week of May? I was out weeding, and… well, I just popped a little piece in my mouth. I don't know why. It just… tasted… cool, I guess? And now it's more and more often.
DOCTOR: And how much dirt are we talking about, Ms. Hardenburgh?
PATIENT: Oh, don’t push me. It's not a mountain of dirt! A little bit. Maybe a tablespoon a day? Sometimes less. It's hard to say, I don't measure it. It's just… I find a little bit, I eat it. Then I forget about it until I want some more. It’s not like I’m intentionally going out seeking it.
DOCTOR: A tablespoon. Right. And have you noticed any other symptoms alongside this… habit?
PATIENT: Habit? It’s not a habit, it’s… a thing. And yes, actually. I’ve been feeling weaker. More tired than usual, which is saying something. And my stomach… it’s been a bit upset. Nothing terrible, just… off. And I've been a little breathless when I'm doing things around the house.
DOCTOR: You said you’ve been feeling weaker and breathless. And your stomach is upset. Do you have any nausea or vomiting?
PATIENT: No, no vomiting. Just… queasy sometimes. Like after you eat something that doesn’t quite agree with you. Not often, though. Mostly just tired, weak, and… this awful craving. It’s embarrassing, really. People think you’re crazy if you eat dirt.
DOCTOR: People are often irrational. Now, Ms. Hardenburgh, have you noticed any changes in your bowel movements?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Do I have to get into that now? Really, doctor? Fine. They’re… different. Harder, mostly. And less… frequent. It's not a big problem, but I have to strain a little more than usual. Is that what you wanted to know?
DOCTOR: It is relevant, Ms. Hardenburgh. Have you been taking any medications currently?
PATIENT: No. Absolutely not. I don’t take anything. I prefer to let my body handle things on its own. All these pills people are popping these days… just unnecessary. Never have, never will. I’ve always been healthy as a horse. Until… well, until this started.
DOCTOR: And no allergies to anything?
PATIENT: No allergies. Not a one. I grew up on a farm, you know? Exposed to everything. Dust, pollen, animals… built up an immunity to it all, I reckon. Never had a problem. This dirt thing is the first unusual thing to happen to me in… well, a very long time.
DOCTOR: Alright. We need to run some tests, Ms. Hardenburgh. Your symptoms, combined with… this unusual dietary habit, could indicate a number of things. We’ll start with a complete blood count, iron levels, and a stool sample. We also need to check your vitamin D levels. Do you consent to these tests?
PATIENT: Tests, huh? All this fuss over a little bit of dirt? Fine. If you insist. But don't expect any miracles. I'm telling you, I'm just a bit run down. But yes, alright. Do what you have to do. Just… get it over with quickly, if you don't mind. I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Very well. I will have the nurse draw your blood now, and provide you with a container for the stool sample. And please, refrain from… consuming any more dirt until we have the results of these tests. It will only complicate matters. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have other patients waiting. The nurse will be in shortly.
PATIENT: .
