DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Way. I'm Dr. Nestingen. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s my back, mostly. It’s been… painful, yeah. Not all the time, but enough to bother me.
DOCTOR: Hmm. And how long has this back pain been going on for?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… it started, I’d say, maybe three months ago? It comes and goes, like I said. Not a constant thing, thankfully. But when it is there, it’s pretty noticeable.
DOCTOR: Three months. Alright. And can you describe the pain for me?
PATIENT: It’s… a dull ache, mostly. Like a soreness, deep down. Sometimes it shoots down my leg a little, but not always. It's worse when I've been standing for a long time, or if I bend over to pick something up.
DOCTOR: Okay, a dull ache that radiates down the leg… and exacerbated by standing or bending. Is it worse on one side than the other, or is it fairly equal?
PATIENT: It's mostly on my right side, I think. Not terribly bad, but definitely more noticeable there than on the left. I don't remember doing anything specific to cause it, you know? Just… started hurting.
DOCTOR: Just started. Alright. And does anything relieve the pain?
PATIENT: Well, sitting down usually helps. And… honestly, just lying down flat for a bit. A warm bath sometimes, too. But it doesn't last long, the relief, you know? It always comes back.
DOCTOR: Sitting, lying down, warm bath… temporary relief. Have you tried any over-the-counter pain medications?
PATIENT: Yeah, I’ve taken some ibuprofen, here and there. It takes the edge off, maybe, but it doesn’t really fix anything. I don’t really like taking pills, so I don’t use it much.
DOCTOR: I see. And have you experienced any numbness, tingling, or weakness in your legs or feet?
PATIENT: No, not really. Everything feels… normal, I guess? No tingling, no weakness. Just the ache in my back. I can walk alright, no trouble with that. Sometimes a little stiff in the mornings, but that's about it.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any other medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Hmm… not really. I had high blood pressure a few years back, but the doctor said it was under control with diet. Otherwise, I think I'm pretty healthy for my age. My wife keeps telling me I need to eat more vegetables, though.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications for that blood pressure, or anything else for that matter?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. The doctor took me off the medication about two years ago. Said my numbers were good enough on their own. Just trying to eat better, like my wife says! I really don’t like taking pills, so I try to avoid it when I can.
DOCTOR: Okay. No current medications. Now, have you had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything in the past?
PATIENT: No, I haven't. Never had surgery, thankfully. Just the usual colds and flu, nothing serious. And a broken arm when I was a kid, but that was a long time ago! I've been pretty lucky, health-wise, all my life.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your family?
PATIENT: Family? Well, my mother had arthritis when she got older. And my father… he had some problems with his knees, I think. Nothing too serious, though. Just the aches and pains that come with getting old, I guess.
DOCTOR: Okay, arthritis in your mother, knee problems in your father… And what do you do for work, Mr. Way?
PATIENT: Oh, I'm an Operations Research Analyst. Mostly I work with computers, figuring out ways to make things more efficient. It’s a desk job, mostly. Been doing it for a long time now. That's why I'm surprised about my back, honestly. I thought sitting all day would be easier on it!
DOCTOR: Right. Well, sitting for prolonged periods can actually cause back pain, unfortunately. Alright, before we move on, do you smoke or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don't smoke. Never have. And I only drink a little bit of wine with dinner sometimes. Nothing too much. Maybe a glass or two a week. Nothing regular. I try to stay healthy, like I said.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, I think it would be best if we did a quick physical exam. Can you lie down on the table for me?
PATIENT: Okay, sure. Sounds good. Let me just… get up here. Hopefully it’s nothing too serious.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, I'm just going to palpate your back to check for tenderness and muscle spasms. Try to relax as much as possible. Tell me if anything feels particularly painful. There's some tenderness along your right paraspinal muscles, and a mild spasm. Range of motion is somewhat limited, particularly with extension. Straight leg raise is negative bilaterally. No neurological deficits noted. Reflexes are 2+ and equal bilaterally.
PATIENT: Okay… yeah, that part on the right does feel a bit sore. Not terrible, but… yeah, that's where it hurts. Extension… is that bending backwards? Feels a little tight. So, negative… what was that word? Bilaterally? What does that mean? I'm sorry, Doctor, I don't always understand all the medical terms.
DOCTOR: Bilaterally means on both sides. It's good that there’s no pain when I lift your legs, that rules out some more serious issues. What I'm feeling suggests musculoskeletal strain, likely aggravated by prolonged sitting. It's not uncommon. Now, given your history and the exam findings, I suspect this is a simple muscle strain, but to be certain, I'd like to order a lumbar X-ray just to rule out any structural abnormalities. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: An X-ray… hmm. I guess so. Is it… expensive? I don’t have insurance, Doctor. I try to avoid things like that if I can, you know? Hopefully it’s nothing serious, like you said. Is it really necessary?
DOCTOR: It's a precaution, Mr. Way. To rule out anything more serious, like a fracture or significant arthritis. The cost... I'm not certain offhand. The billing department can provide you with an estimate. However, without it, I cannot definitively diagnose the cause of your pain. We could try a course of conservative treatment first - physical therapy, over-the-counter pain relievers, and a home exercise program - but if your pain doesn't improve within a few weeks, we would still need to obtain an X-ray. Alternatively, I can refer you to a specialist, a physiatrist, who can evaluate you and determine the best course of action. However, they will almost certainly recommend an X-ray as well.
PATIENT: Oh dear. That sounds… complicated. And expensive. I guess… if it really is the best thing to do, I can get the X-ray. But I'd really prefer to try the other stuff first, if that’s okay. The physical therapy and the exercises… maybe that’s enough? I’m not a fan of spending money if I don’t have to, you know? Can we try that first?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Way. We can try conservative management first. I will provide you with a prescription for a muscle relaxant, to help alleviate some of the spasm. I’ll also give you a handout outlining some basic exercises you can do at home, and a referral to a physical therapist. I want you to follow the exercise program diligently, and continue with over-the-counter pain relievers as needed. If your pain doesn’t improve significantly within two weeks, or if it worsens at any time, you must schedule an appointment for an X-ray. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, I understand. Two weeks, and then we talk about the X-ray if it doesn’t get better. Muscle relaxant… I hope that doesn’t make me too sleepy. And I will try my best with the exercises. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you being patient with me.
DOCTOR: Very well. The nurse will be in shortly to provide you with the prescription and the handout. Schedule a follow-up appointment with my office in two weeks to assess your progress. If you experience any new or worsening symptoms – numbness, tingling, weakness, or bowel or bladder dysfunction – seek immediate medical attention. Do you have any further questions for me?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think that’s everything. You explained everything very clearly. Thank you again for your help. I appreciate you taking the time to see me.
DOCTOR: Very well. Have a good day, Mr. Way. .
