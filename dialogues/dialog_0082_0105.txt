DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kochubey. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Iuzzolino. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Uh, good morning, Doctor. It’s… about getting surgery. For my weight, you know? I think my wife set this up. She does a lot of the organizing. I… honestly don’t remember all the details. It’s a pre-surgery thing, right? Before I actually have the surgery?
DOCTOR: Yes, that sounds right. A pre-operative visit. It’s good your wife is involved, that’s very helpful. And it's perfectly alright if you don’t remember everything, we'll go through it together. Just tell me what you are feeling or concerned about regarding the surgery… and we’ll fill in the gaps as we go. To start, can you tell me a bit about why you’re considering weight loss surgery?
PATIENT: Well… I’ve always been… bigger, I guess. But it’s gotten harder to do things. Walking, mostly. And I get tired really easily. My wife worries about my health, and… I want to be around for my grandkids, you know? They’re still little. It just feels like it's… a lot of effort to do everyday stuff now. I don't really know what else to say. It’s more about feeling better, I think, than a specific weight number. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It makes perfect sense, Mr. Kochubey. Feeling better and being able to enjoy time with your grandkids is a very valid reason. It sounds like your quality of life is being impacted, and that’s something we definitely want to address. To get a clearer picture of things, could you tell me a little bit about how long you’ve been experiencing this fatigue and difficulty walking?
PATIENT: Hmm… that's a good question. It's… gradual, you know? It didn't just happen overnight. Maybe the last few years? It started with just getting winded easier, then it became harder to walk long distances. Now… even just going up the stairs is a struggle sometimes. My wife keeps telling me I need to get checked out, and I guess… she's right. I just… I don’t keep track of dates very well. Sorry.
DOCTOR: No apologies necessary at all, Mr. Kochubey. It’s perfectly alright. Gradual changes can be difficult to pinpoint. So, a few years of increasing difficulty with walking and fatigue. Have you noticed any pain associated with walking?
PATIENT: Pain… sometimes. Not always. It’s more of an ache, really. In my knees and… my hips, I think. It’s worse after I’ve been on my feet for a while. Like if I go grocery shopping, or try to play with the grandkids. It’s not sharp pain, it’s just… uncomfortable. It makes me not want to do things, if that makes sense. I try to avoid things that make it worse.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. An ache in your knees and hips, worse with activity, and leading you to avoid things. Okay. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your overall health. Do you have any other medical conditions that you are aware of – like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Uh… I don’t think so. I haven’t been to the doctor in a while, to be honest. My wife usually handles all that. I know I’m a little… overweight, but that’s about it. I don't remember the doctor ever telling me I had anything else. Maybe a little high cholesterol a long time ago, but I’m not sure. She’d definitely know more about that. Sorry. I’m not much help, am I?
DOCTOR: You're doing just fine, Mr. Kochubey. It's alright if you don't remember everything, we can look things up in our records. It sounds like you haven't had a comprehensive check-up recently. Let's see what we have on file. … Ah, yes. It appears you were diagnosed with mild hypertension about five years ago, and borderline high cholesterol. It doesn’t look like you’ve been regularly monitored for either. Are you currently taking any medications at all?
PATIENT: Oh… okay. I… I didn’t remember that. My wife must have told me. No, I’m not taking anything right now. Never have, as far as I know. I don’t really like taking pills, if I can avoid it. That’s probably why I haven’t bothered… although I really should listen to her more. She’s always right. Still, no pills. Nope.
DOCTOR: Alright, no current medications. That’s good to know. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else – like food, latex, or bee stings?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No, I don't think so. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything. I eat pretty much everything. No food allergies, no bee stings… nothing comes to mind. My wife hasn't ever said anything about me having allergies, either. I’m pretty lucky, I guess. Just… a little forgetful. Sorry. Is this getting annoying? I feel like I’m just rambling.
DOCTOR: Not at all, Mr. Kochubey. You're not rambling, and you're not annoying me in the slightest. It's helpful for me to get this information, and it's perfectly alright if you don’t remember everything. So, no known allergies, which is excellent. Now, let’s talk a bit about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – like heart disease, diabetes, cancer, or obesity?
PATIENT: Oh, family history… That’s a tough one. My dad… he had heart problems. I think he had a heart attack when he was pretty young. And my mom… she was overweight her whole life. And her mother, my grandma, she had diabetes. That’s about all I can remember. It was a pretty big family, so there was a lot going on, and I was never really good at remembering all the details. I know they all ate a lot of… rich food, if that makes sense. A lot of sweets and stuff. Sorry again. I feel bad not being more helpful.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize, Mr. Kochubey. That’s very helpful to know – heart disease in your father, obesity and diabetes in your grandmother. That gives us some important information. Now, just a few more questions. Do you smoke or use any tobacco products?
PATIENT: No, never have. My wife would kill me if I did. And honestly, I don't like the smell of it. No smoking, no chewing, nothing. Clean lungs, I think. Or as clean as they can be for someone my age. Sorry. Is this taking a long time? I don’t want to take up too much of your time.
DOCTOR: No, this isn't taking a long time at all, Mr. Kochubey. And you're not taking up any of my time. You're doing great. Alright, no smoking. And finally, how much alcohol do you drink, if at all?
PATIENT: Uh… not much. I have a glass of wine with dinner sometimes. Maybe a couple of times a week. Nothing crazy. My wife and I… we just relax with it. It’s not a habit, or anything. Just… a little something to unwind. Not a big drinker, definitely. I can’t handle my alcohol very well, if that tells you anything. Sorry. I really am trying to remember everything, but it's… a struggle.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Mr. Kochubey. A couple of glasses of wine a week is very moderate. Okay, that covers most of the important history questions. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. Just a basic check of your heart, lungs, blood pressure, and a look at your knees and hips to see what’s going on. It will help me get a better understanding of your situation. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that's fine. Whatever you need to do. I trust you, Doctor. Go ahead. I’ll just… sit here, right? Try not to move around too much. Sorry. I just… I don’t like doctors very much. Not that you’re doing anything wrong! Just… a bit anxious.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Kochubey. It’s very common to feel anxious at the doctor’s office. I’ll do my best to make this as quick and comfortable as possible. Okay, your blood pressure is a little elevated, 145 over 90. Your pulse is 78 and regular. Your heart sounds are normal, but there is some mild wheezing in your lungs. Now, let’s take a look at your knees. There’s some tenderness on the inside of both knees, and a slight limitation in range of motion. No swelling that I can detect. Now, your hips… There’s some tenderness in both hips, especially when you bend them. Again, some limitation in range of motion. Overall, your exam suggests some mild arthritis in your knees and hips, which is consistent with your reported pain and limited range of motion. The mild wheezing in your lungs is something we should monitor. Okay, that's all for the physical exam. Now, do you have any questions for me before we discuss next steps?
PATIENT: Arthritis… That sounds bad. Is that why my knees and hips hurt? And the wheezing… is that serious? I don’t want to need surgery, Doctor. That’s what I’m really afraid of. I’m not a brave man, if I’m honest. I just… want to be able to play with my grandkids without being in pain. Is that too much to ask? Sorry. I’m probably being a worrywart.
DOCTOR: It’s not bad, Mr. Kochubey, not necessarily. Arthritis simply means inflammation of the joints. It’s very common, especially as we get older, and it doesn’t always require surgery. It’s often manageable with other treatments. And the wheezing… it’s mild right now, but we need to investigate it. It could be related to a number of things, like allergies or a previous respiratory infection. We’ll need to do some further testing to determine the cause. You’re not being a worrywart at all. It’s perfectly normal to be anxious about surgery. And wanting to be able to play with your grandkids without pain is absolutely not too much to ask. That’s a very reasonable goal. Before we talk about specific treatment options, I’d like to order some blood tests and a chest X-ray. The blood tests will help us assess your overall health, check your cholesterol levels, and look for any signs of inflammation. The chest X-ray will help us determine the cause of the wheezing. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good. Whatever tests you think I need. Blood tests and an X-ray… okay. My wife will be happy to hear we’re getting to the bottom of things. She always says I need more tests. I’ll… I’ll let her handle scheduling everything. She’s much better at it than I am. Sorry. I just… I get overwhelmed easily. Will the tests take a long time? I don't want to be a bother.
DOCTOR: You’re not a bother at all, Mr. Kochubey. And letting your wife handle the scheduling is perfectly fine. It sounds like she’s a great support to you. The blood tests should be relatively quick, just a few vials of blood. The X-ray will only take a few minutes. The results will likely take a few days to come back. Once we have them, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them in detail and develop a treatment plan. In the meantime, I recommend you continue to stay active, but avoid any activities that cause you significant pain. You can also try over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or naproxen to help manage your discomfort. Do you have any other questions for me before we finish up?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s everything. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very patient with me. And… you didn’t make me feel silly for not remembering everything. My wife is going to be so relieved. She’s been worried about me for a long time. I’ll let her know when she can schedule the tests. I guess… I’ll see you when the results are back. Thank you again, Doctor. And… have a good day. Sorry. I’m rambling again.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Kochubey. It was my pleasure. And don't worry about rambling. It's perfectly alright. I’m glad I could ease some of your concerns. Yes, you’ll hear from my office to schedule a follow-up once the results are back. In the meantime, please don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. And you have a good day as well, Mr. Kochubey. It was nice meeting you.
