DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Sucich. I'm Dr. Todorovich. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s these hiccups, you see. Been going on for… well, it feels like forever now, but maybe three days? It’s just… relentless. Not painful, thankfully, just… annoying. Really annoying!
DOCTOR: Three days of hiccups, huh?
PATIENT: Yes, three days. Though, to be honest, I lost track a little yesterday afternoon. I was watching my stories… always makes the time fly, you know? But definitely since Monday, at least. They come and go, but they keep coming back. It's like a little jumping bean in my chest.
DOCTOR: Stories, alright. And have you tried anything to get rid of them?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, have I! Everything my daughter told me to, practically. Holding my breath – makes me feel a bit dizzy. Drinking water upside down… that just made a mess. And she told me about… what was it… a spoonful of sugar? Didn’t do a thing. I even tried startling myself, but I just jumped! It's all a bit silly, really.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, hiccups lasting three days can be… unusual. Let's just run through a few things to make sure it's nothing serious. Do you have any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, let me think… No, not really. I mean, I'm a bit tired, but I’m eighty-six, Doctor! I think that comes with the territory. No pain anywhere, no trouble breathing… just the hiccups. And maybe a bit of indigestion sometimes, now that I think of it. But I always get that when I eat too much mango. Do you think it could be the mango?
DOCTOR: It could be. Though, three days is a long time for just indigestion. Do you have any history of… well, anything significant?
PATIENT: Significant… oh dear. Let me see. I had the flu, badly, about ten years ago. And my gallbladder out when I was fifty, but that was a long time back. My daughter always says I have a weak heart, but the doctors never said so. Oh, and I was divorced, if that's significant! A very long divorce, that was. No children, though. Just me and my stories. I did work as a psychiatric aide for years, if that matters. Dealing with other people’s troubles, all the time.
DOCTOR: Psychiatric aide… okay. Any family history of anything like… neurological problems, or… anything that runs in the family?
PATIENT: Oh, family history… that’s a hard one. My mother… she had a bit of memory trouble towards the end. Not dementia, the doctors said, just… getting old, they said. And my father… he was a strong man, a fisherman, but he drank a bit too much. That’s about all I can recall, honestly. My family wasn’t one for talking about illnesses. We talked about the weather, mostly. And the fish.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, let’s have a listen to your lungs and check your heart rate. Just to be sure. It's probably nothing, but we need to rule things out. Can you just take a deep breath for me?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. My chest feels a bit… tight sometimes, if that matters. Not painful, just… a bit constricted. Ready when you are. Though, please be gentle, dear. I bruise easily, you know.
DOCTOR: Okay… deep breath. And again. Heart sounds are… regular, but a little faint. Blood pressure is 140/90, which is a little elevated. Alright. Your lungs sound clear. Heart is a bit quiet, but nothing alarming. Do you take any medications currently, Ms. Sucich?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, I do. Just one thing, really. Losartan, for my blood pressure. My doctor prescribed it about five years ago. Small dose, only 25 milligrams. And sometimes, if my arthritis is acting up, I take a bit of ibuprofen, but not very often. I did used to take something for my stomach, but the doctor took me off it a while back. Said it wasn’t doing any good. I’m usually very good with remembering my pills, though. I have a little chart, you see.
DOCTOR: Okay. Losartan… and ibuprofen as needed. Alright, Ms. Sucich, honestly, this is probably just a bit of irritation from something you ate, or maybe a side effect of the Losartan. Though three days is a long time. We could run some blood tests to rule out anything serious, but I doubt it will show anything. Or, we could try a different blood pressure medication. What do you think?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Blood tests… I don’t really like needles, Doctor. And changing my medication… I’ve been on this Losartan for so long, I’m used to it. Maybe… maybe we could just wait another day or two? See if it goes away on its own? I hate to bother with tests and changes if it might just be… nothing. I’m a bit of a worrier, you see. And all this talk of tests is making me feel a bit anxious.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Sucich. We can wait a few more days. But if it’s still going on after two days, you need to come back in, and we’ll do those blood tests. And if you experience any trouble breathing, or if you feel dizzy or lightheaded, come to the emergency room immediately, understand?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, Doctor, I understand perfectly. No trouble breathing, and if I feel dizzy, straight to the emergency room. Two days… I’ll keep track. Thank you, dear. You’ve put my mind a bit at ease. It’s just… these hiccups are so tiresome! I’m hoping they just disappear on their own. Is there anything else you think I should be doing? Any special tea, perhaps?
DOCTOR: No special tea, Ms. Sucich. Just… try to relax. And drink plenty of fluids. If they don’t stop in two days, come back in. I have other patients waiting, so I’m going to need to wrap this up. But honestly, it’s probably nothing. Try not to worry. .
PATIENT: .
