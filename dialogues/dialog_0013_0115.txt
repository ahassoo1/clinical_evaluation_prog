DOCTOR: Hi Annelle, it's lovely to meet you. I'm Chriselda Morenomartinez, but you can call me Chriselda. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Yes, well. It’s… a patient. A young man. He’s… quite yellow. I believe it has something to do with his liver. Honestly, it was a rather confusing case, and I’m hoping you can… sort it out. I’m afraid my memory isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Okay, a young man presenting with jaundice… Let’s get some details. Just to be clear, you said you didn’t see this patient, you’re referring me a case?
PATIENT: Precisely. I’m a dosimetrist, dear. I… calculate things. Radiation. Not… diagnose illnesses. A colleague brought the case to my attention, as I… assisted with his treatment planning. Though, truthfully, I don't recall the specifics of why he needed treatment in the first place. It was some time ago, and… well, as I said. My memory. Is it alright if I simply tell you what I observed about the… yellowness?
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely. That’s perfectly fine. Start with whatever you recall about the yellowness – when you noticed it, where it was most prominent, anything that stood out. And don't worry about specifics you don’t remember; we'll piece things together. Is this patient currently under our care, or are you referring him to us?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. I believe he was… being seen by another doctor, initially. Before the treatment planning, that is. I’m not certain who. It was a rather busy period. As for the yellowness… it was primarily in his eyes, I think. And… his skin, of course. A sort of… golden hue. It wasn’t… subtle. But I haven’t seen him since the initial scans. I truly haven't. I'm afraid I can't offer much more detail, dear. It was… a while ago. Perhaps his records will be more helpful?
DOCTOR: Okay, let me pull up his file. Name?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. The name… It’s on the tip of my tongue. A… common name, I believe. Something… Arabic sounding? Perhaps… Hassan? No, that doesn’t feel right. I truly apologize. It’s terribly frustrating. I assisted with so many cases… It all blurs together after a while. Is there a way to search by… date of treatment planning? That might be easier.
DOCTOR: Yes, we can definitely search by date. Do you recall approximately when this treatment planning took place?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It was… before the holidays. Last year, certainly. Before Christmas, I believe. Perhaps… November? Or early December? It was a rather damp autumn, if that helps at all. I do recall complaining about the rain. Oh, dear. This is all so vague, isn't it? I feel terribly unhelpful.
DOCTOR: Okay, let's see… filtering for treatment planning sessions in November and December of last year. There are a few possibilities here… Let me see… Ah. Is “Jamal Al-Din” the patient?
PATIENT: Yes! Yes, that’s it! Jamal Al-Din. That’s the name. Oh, thank goodness. You found him. Yes, that’s the young man. I’m so glad. He… he looked very unwell. Now, perhaps you can determine what was causing the… discoloration? I truly haven’t a clue. I simply observed it during the scans. I'm ready to be excused if you don't need me any further.
DOCTOR: Okay, excellent. Let me pull up his history... He presented initially with fatigue, abdominal pain, and dark urine. His bilirubin levels were significantly elevated, and imaging showed some… concerning findings in his liver. It appears he was diagnosed with acute hepatitis B. He underwent treatment, but there’s a note here about incomplete follow-up. He hasn't been seen in several months. Do you recall anything about his overall condition during the scans – was he jaundiced then, did he seem acutely ill, any other observations?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. It was… a long time ago. Yes, he was quite yellow, as I said. And… tired-looking. Very pale, despite the jaundice. I believe he was… weak. But beyond that… I'm afraid my memory fails me. I don't recall anything specific about how acutely ill he seemed. I was focused on the radiation calculations, you see. Not… diagnosing illnesses. It's all rather a blur. Honestly, I’m beginning to feel quite faint. Is there anything else I can assist with? Or may I be excused? I have… appointments. A great many appointments.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Fatigue, pallor, jaundice observed during the initial scans… incomplete follow-up noted. Thank you for your assistance, even with the limited recall. I think we have enough to go on for now. We’ll need to locate Jamal Al-Din and bring him in for a full re-evaluation. I’ll have my nurse reach out to him. You are excused. Please, take care and don't hesitate to contact us if you recall anything further. And thank you again for bringing this to our attention.
PATIENT: Oh, thank goodness. Thank you, dear. I’m so relieved I could be of some assistance. It’s been… quite stressful. Yes, well. Good day.
