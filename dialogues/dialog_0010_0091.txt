DOCTOR: Good morning, Bianca. I’m Dr. Annesley. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Well, lately I does be feeling real thirsty all the time. And hungry! Even after I eat a good plate of food, I feel like I could eat some more. It just don't seem right, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand. Feeling excessively thirsty and hungry, even after eating, isn't typical. How long has this been going on for, Bianca?
PATIENT: Hmm... let me see. I think it start about... maybe a month now? It wasn't so bad at first, just a little more thirsty than usual. But the last couple weeks it really get worse. I does have to drink water almost constantly, and I still feel dry. And the hunger... oh lord, the hunger is something else! It's like a hole inside me.
DOCTOR: Okay, about a month, progressively worsening. And you said it feels like a hole inside you... is that constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It mostly constant, Doctor. But sometimes it feel... sharper. Like a cramping, you know? Especially if I don't eat for a little while. Then it really bother me. It's not a bad pain, just uncomfortable. And makes me want to eat everything in sight! It's just... not normal for me, you know? I always been a normal eater.
DOCTOR: Okay, constant hunger with sharper sensations when you haven't eaten for a bit. That's helpful. Now, besides the thirst and hunger, have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Let me think... well, I does have to go to the bathroom more often, yes. Especially to pee. And I does feel a little tired sometimes, but I thought that was just from working. I does work outside, you know, with the pumps. It's a hard job. But maybe that's not all it is? I'm not sure. Everything just feel a little... off. I don't know how to explain it.
DOCTOR: Okay, increased urination and some fatigue. That’s good information, Bianca. Now, let's talk a little about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions before, like diabetes, high blood pressure, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never been diagnosed with nothing. I does try to stay healthy, you know? Eat my greens, drink plenty water... well, more water now than ever! I haven't really been to the doctor much in my life. Just for check-ups when I have to. My husband, he takes care of most things like that. But he's away on a job right now, and this just... got worse. I thought I should come and get it checked out.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. No prior diagnoses, and you generally try to stay healthy. And what about your family?
PATIENT: Hmm... my mother, she had something with her sugar, I think. She was always tired and going to the bathroom a lot. I think it was diabetes, but I wasn't so old when she got sick. My father, he was a strong man, never sick a day in his life. And my husband's side of the family... I don't really know them too well, to be honest. They live far away. I don't think nobody in his family had any big problems with their health, but I couldn't say for sure.
DOCTOR: Okay, a possible family history of diabetes on your mother’s side. Now, are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing at all. Just the regular food and water. I don't like taking pills if I don't have to. Makes me feel sick to my stomach. My husband, he takes some vitamins, but I never got into that. I just try to eat good, that's what I always do. Though lately, I've been eating too much, I think! That's why I'm worried.
DOCTOR: Okay, no medications currently. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not that I know of. I can eat anything, never had a problem. Same with medications. I never really had to take any, so I wouldn't know if I was allergic to anything. I'm a pretty lucky woman, usually. But this thirst and hunger... it's not luck. Something ain't right, I tell you.
DOCTOR: Alright, Bianca. Based on what you’ve told me – the excessive thirst and hunger, frequent urination, fatigue, and possible family history of diabetes – it sounds like we need to do a few tests to rule some things out. The most likely possibility is diabetes, but we'll confirm with a blood sugar test. I'd also like to check your kidney function and do a basic urine test. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds fine. If you think it's best to do some tests, I trust your judgement. I just want to know what's going on with me. This is just... worrying me too much. The thirst and the hunger, it's just not normal. So yes, please. Do whatever you think is best to find out what's wrong. I'm ready.
DOCTOR: Good. That’s a good attitude, Bianca. We'll get to the bottom of this. First, I’m going to take your vital signs - your blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. Then, we’ll draw a little blood, and I’ll need a urine sample. It's just a simple procedure. Do you know where the restroom is?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I saw it just down the hall, to the left. I can go and get that urine sample now, if you like. It's no problem. Just tell me when you're ready for it. And thank you, Doctor. For listening to me, and for taking the time to help. I really appreciate it. I does get worried easily, you know.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Bianca. That's what I’m here for. Go ahead and collect the sample when you're ready. And don't worry; we'll take things one step at a time. I'll be ready when you are. Just let the nurse know when you've collected it, and they'll bring it to me. I'm going to start with your blood pressure now. Could you please take a seat on the examination table?
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. I'll go and do that now. Thank you again.
