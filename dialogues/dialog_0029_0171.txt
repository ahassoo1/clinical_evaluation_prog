DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Thut. I'm Dr. Chora. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Uh, morning. It's my nails. They just... look funny. Not good funny. I don't really... remember when they started, exactly. Just noticed 'em. They always used to be nice.
DOCTOR: Okay. “Funny” how?
PATIENT: Well, not ha-ha funny. More like… weird. They're kinda thick, you know? And the color ain’t right. Not my usual color. It's like… yellowish. See? They just look… off. I don't know what else to tell ya.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Yes, I see what you mean. They are a bit discolored, and definitely thicker than usual. And there's some slight pitting – little dents in the nail surface. Have you noticed any pain or discomfort with your nails?
PATIENT: Pain? Not really. Maybe a little… when I'm diggin' in the garden, but I do a lot of gardenin'. I thought it was just my fingers, you know? From the dirt. I don't pay it much mind. Everything hurts a little when you get older.
DOCTOR: Okay. And how long have you been gardening regularly?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Forever. Since I was a little girl, I guess. My mama always had a garden. I took over when… well, when she wasn't able to anymore. It's… it's good for the soul, gardenin'. But I don't know if that's got somethin' to do with my nails. You think so?
DOCTOR: It could be related. Frequent exposure to soil can sometimes cause nail changes. But we need to rule out other possibilities first. Have you noticed this happening with all of your nails, or just some of them?
PATIENT: Uhm… I think… most of 'em. Maybe not the little ones on my pinky fingers, but the big ones, yeah. They all look kinda… the same funny color now. It's hard to remember exactly when it started on each one. I don’t really look at my nails, if you know what I mean.
DOCTOR: Right, I understand. Okay. And have you had any other symptoms lately?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Like… sick symptoms? No, not really. I'm a little tired, I guess. But who isn’t? Old age, ya know. And my knees ache, but that's just… knees. Is this somethin' bad? Is it somethin' I caught?
DOCTOR: No, let's not jump to conclusions. It's good you're not experiencing other symptoms. Fatigue and aching joints can have many causes. We need to investigate what's going on with your nails specifically. Let me just check your chart here… I see you have Medicare, and you're located in a rural area. Okay. Do you have any allergies to medications, or any existing medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Medicare's good, right? I don’t think I'm allergic to anything. I used to get a rash from poison ivy, but that's not a medicine. And… uh… I had a little bit of high blood pressure a few years back, but the doctor gave me a pill for it. I take it every day. That's all, I think. Do you need to know what the pill is? I don't remember the name. It's a little white one.
DOCTOR: Yes, knowing the name of the medication would be helpful. It's important to have a complete list of everything you're taking. Do you have a pharmacy you usually use?
PATIENT: Uhm… Pharmacy? I get it from… the one in town. The little one? Old Man Hemlock runs it. He's been there forever. He just knows me, ya know? I don't really… tell him what it's for. I just give him the paper from the doctor, and he gives me the pills. I don't think he knows the name of it either. I'm not good with names, never have been. Is it important?
DOCTOR: Okay. It is important, Ms. Thut. We need to know exactly what you're taking to rule out potential interactions or side effects. Would you be comfortable with me calling Old Man Hemlock to get that information?
PATIENT: Uhm… I guess so. If you have to. But he's a bit… grumpy. Don't expect much help from him. Just tell him Dr. Chora sent ya. He might be nicer then. He likes doctors, I think. He always asks about 'em. It's just… he's old. And forgetful, too. So, don't be surprised if he doesn't know.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let me give him a call. Hello?
PATIENT: 
DOCTOR: Okay, that was a bit of a process, but I got it. You are taking Lisinopril, 20 milligrams daily, for high blood pressure. Now, about your nails… Given the thickening, discoloration, and slight pitting, and considering your gardening habits, it could be a fungal infection. It's also possible it's a reaction to something else, but fungal infections are common with prolonged exposure to soil. I'd like to take a nail sample to send to the lab for testing to confirm. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Fungus? Like… dirt fungus? That doesn't sound good. You mean I got somethin’ growin' on my nails? I don’t want nothin’ growin’ on me. But… if you think it’s best… I guess. How do you… get a sample? Does it hurt? I don't like needles.
DOCTOR: No needles, Ms. Thut, don't worry. It’s very simple. I’ll just clip a small piece of the nail from a few different nails. It might feel a little bit of pressure, like getting a manicure, but it shouldn’t hurt. Then we'll send it to the lab, and they’ll tell us exactly what we’re dealing with. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Uhm… A little bit of pressure is okay, I guess. As long as you don’t take off the whole nail! I need these. For gardenin’, ya know? Just… be gentle, okay? And tell me what you're doin' before you do it. I don’t like surprises.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I'll be very gentle. I’ll just trim a small piece from several nails, starting with this one. Just a little bit, see?
PATIENT: Uhm… Okay, that wasn't too bad. But don't take off too much! I need 'em for the tomatoes. They're almost ready, you know. It looks… kinda weird without it. Is it gonna grow back? I need those nails. Really.
DOCTOR: It will grow back, Ms. Thut. Nails grow slowly, but they do grow back. Now I’m just taking a small piece from this one… and then this one… It's a standard procedure, and it doesn't harm the nail bed. Once I have enough samples, I'll send them to the lab. It usually takes about a week or so to get the results. While we're waiting, we can discuss potential treatment options, depending on what the lab finds. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Uhm… Okay, okay. A week ain't so bad, I guess. As long as I can still garden. My tomatoes depend on it. They look a little… stubby now. But I suppose it's better than havin' somethin' growin' on 'em. What kind of treatment are we talkin' about? Pills again? I don't like takin' pills. And I hope it doesn’t cost too much. Medicare only covers so much, ya know?
DOCTOR: Okay. Treatment options vary depending on the type of fungus, if that is indeed the problem. Sometimes it can be managed with a topical medication – a nail polish or cream you apply directly to the nails. Other times, an oral medication is necessary. We'll discuss all the options thoroughly once we have the lab results and determine the best course of action for you. I’ll check your Medicare coverage and give you an estimate of the costs beforehand, so there are no surprises. Now, while we're waiting for the lab results, I’d recommend keeping your nails trimmed short, dry, and clean. Avoid sharing nail clippers and try to avoid prolonged exposure to soil if possible. Any questions so far?
PATIENT: Uhm… No sharin' clippers, I can do that. I wouldn’t share with anyone. But avoidin' the garden? That's askin' a lot. The tomatoes… they need me. Is there a special kind of glove I can get? One that keeps the dirt off, but still lets me dig? And what about the waterin'? I gotta water 'em every day. I just… really like my garden. It keeps me busy, ya know? It's more than just tomatoes.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Thut. Gardening is clearly important to you. We can absolutely work around that. There are gloves specifically designed for gardening that can provide a barrier against soil and moisture. I can recommend a few brands that might work for you. As for watering, try to keep your hands as dry as possible afterward and use a good hand moisturizer. We'll do our best to find a solution that allows you to continue enjoying your garden while still addressing the issue with your nails. Let me write down some recommendations for gardening gloves and a good moisturizer. I also want to schedule a follow-up appointment for about a week from today to discuss the lab results. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Uhm… Gloves, that's good. That's a good idea. As long as they don't make my hands too sweaty. And a follow-up… okay, a week. That's fine. I'm glad you understand about the garden. It's… it's my happy place, ya know? So, you really think it's the dirt? And not somethin' worse? I worry, sometimes. Old age, ya know. Things start breakin' down.
DOCTOR: It's very common for nails to be affected by fungal infections, especially with regular exposure to soil. That’s why I’m leaning towards that as the most likely cause. But we need the lab results to confirm it and rule out any other possibilities. And it’s perfectly normal to worry, Ms. Thut. That’s why we’re here – to investigate and make sure you get the best possible care. Here’s the list of gloves and moisturizer brands. I’ve also included a phone number for the lab, so you can check on the results if you’d like. And I’ll have my nurse schedule that follow-up appointment for you before you leave. Do you have any other questions for me right now?
PATIENT: Uhm… No, I think that's everything for now. Thank you, Doctor. You've been very… helpful. You don't seem to think I'm crazy for worryin' about tomatoes. That's nice. I guess I’ll go get some gloves. And see what the lab says. Thank you again. And tell your nurse to be gentle with my schedule. Old age, ya know. It takes a while to do things. .
DOCTOR: You're welcome, Ms. Thut. Have a good day.
