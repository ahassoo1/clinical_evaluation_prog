DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Ms. Nissenbaum. I'm Dr. Soodeen. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Honestly, it's quite simple. I woke up this morning and I can't hear out of my left ear. And my face… well, it feels droopy on that side. It’s really quite inconvenient, and frankly, a bit alarming. I don’t have time for this.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. A sudden loss of hearing and facial drooping is definitely concerning, and we’ll get to the bottom of this as quickly as possible. To help me understand what’s going on, can you tell me when exactly you first noticed these symptoms?
PATIENT: This morning, as I said. Around… let me think… 7:15 AM, I believe. I was making my tea, and I didn’t hear the kettle whistle. I thought it was broken, then I realised… nothing. And when I looked in the mirror while brushing my teeth, that side of my face just… wasn't right. It’s not subtle, Doctor. I’m not imagining things.
DOCTOR: Thank you. And has anything like this happened before?
PATIENT: Absolutely not. I’ve never experienced anything like this in my life. And I assure you, I have a very good memory. I would remember if it had. I take excellent care of myself, you know. It’s just… perplexing. Are you going to examine me, or are we just going to talk about it all day?
DOCTOR: Yes, of course. A physical examination is the next step. I want to assess the function of your facial nerves and get a better understanding of what’s going on. First, I'm going to take a look in your ears with an otoscope. Then, I'll ask you to perform a few simple movements with your face – things like closing your eyes tightly, raising your eyebrows, smiling, and puffing out your cheeks. This will help me determine where the issue might be. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, get on with it. The sooner we figure this out, the better. I have appointments, you know. And please be gentle. I don’t need any unnecessary discomfort. Honestly, sometimes I wonder if doctors even listen anymore. It's all procedures and no… common sense.
DOCTOR: Alright. I'm looking in your ears now… The ear canal appears clear on both sides, no obvious signs of infection or blockage. Now, could you please close your eyes tightly for me?
PATIENT: There. Is that… what you wanted? It feels a bit strained on this side, you know. Like it’s not working properly. See? I told you. It's quite obvious. Don't waste my time telling me everything is fine.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see. There is noticeable weakness on the left side. Now, could you please raise your eyebrows as high as you can?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, are you even paying attention? It’s barely lifting. It looks ridiculous. Is this going to take much longer? I have a luncheon with… never mind. Just tell me what’s wrong.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Nissenbaum, I understand your frustration. Based on what you've described and what I’m seeing during the examination – the sudden onset of hearing loss and facial weakness, particularly with difficulty closing your left eye and raising your eyebrow – this is concerning for Bell’s palsy. However, we need to rule out other possibilities, such as a stroke, before making a definitive diagnosis. Do you have any other symptoms, like any weakness or numbness in any other part of your body, difficulty speaking, or dizziness?
PATIENT: Weakness? No. Numbness? No. Speaking is fine, though I prefer not to repeat myself. And dizziness? Absolutely not. I have excellent balance, thank you very much. Look, is this Bell’s palsy going to require… extensive treatment? Because I simply don’t have the time for that. I’m a busy woman. And I certainly don’t want to be stuck in a hospital. I haven't got insurance, you know. This is all very inconvenient.
DOCTOR: Okay. Given your symptoms and the fact that you don’t have any other neurological deficits, Bell’s palsy is the most likely diagnosis at this point. However, to be absolutely certain, I would like to order an MRI of your brain just to rule out other potential causes. Because you do not have insurance, I can refer you to the county hospital where they have financial assistance programs available to help cover the cost. Would you be open to that?
PATIENT: An MRI? Honestly. Is that absolutely necessary? I mean, I told you I don’t have any other symptoms. It sounds expensive, and frankly, a waste of time. But... I suppose if you insist. Fine. The county hospital. As long as it doesn't involve a long wait, and the facilities are… acceptable. I have standards, you know. And please, don’t make me fill out a mountain of paperwork. I've had enough inconvenience for one day. Just give me the referral. Let’s get this over with.
DOCTOR: Alright. I'm printing a referral for an MRI at County General Hospital. They do have financial assistance programs, and I’ll have the receptionist provide you with the information on how to apply. They will contact you to schedule the appointment. In the meantime, I’m going to prescribe you a course of oral steroids, Prednisone, to help reduce inflammation of the facial nerve. This is typically very effective if started within 72 hours of symptom onset. It’s important to complete the full course, even if you start feeling better. Here's the prescription. Take it to your local pharmacy. I'm also going to give you some eye drops to lubricate your left eye, as you may not be able to close it fully, which can lead to dryness. I'll have the receptionist provide those as well. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Eye drops… right. And the steroids. Fine. Is that all? Honestly, I’m not sure I want to know all the potential side effects of these drugs. I just want to get better, quickly. No, I don't have any questions. Just… make sure they understand I don’t have a lot of time to wait. And please, tell the hospital to send the results to you directly. I do not want to be burdened with chasing down medical records. Thank you. I suppose. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have a luncheon to attend.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Nissenbaum. We will ensure the hospital sends the results directly to our office. The receptionist will provide you with contact information if you have any questions or concerns. I hope you have a speedy recovery. And please, don't hesitate to contact us if your symptoms worsen. .
PATIENT: Very well. Thank you. Luncheon… honestly, the things one has to endure…
