DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Gedalya. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Pfennig. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. Well, it’s… it’s a bit difficult to explain, honestly. I've been feeling weaker, progressively so, over the last few months. And my eyelids… they’ve started to droop. It’s becoming quite noticeable, and it's a little worrying.
DOCTOR: Okay, Gedalya. It’s good you came in to get it checked out. Progressive weakness and drooping eyelids – we definitely want to figure out what's going on. To start, can you tell me more about this weakness?
PATIENT: Certainly. It started, I think, in my legs. Just feeling a little more tired after walking, needing to sit down more often. Now… it's moved up into my arms too. Lifting things feels harder. It’s not a sudden thing, like I pulled a muscle or anything. It’s just… getting harder and harder to do things I used to do without thinking. And I find myself getting winded more easily.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it started in your legs and has gradually moved up to your arms, with increasing difficulty in everyday tasks and some shortness of breath. And you haven’t noticed any specific injury that triggered this, it just developed over time?
PATIENT: That’s right, exactly. No injury. It just… crept up on me. I didn’t really pay attention at first, thought it was just getting older, maybe not exercising enough. But it's definitely not getting better, and now it’s… concerning. I’m divorced, and I live alone, so there's no one really noticing these things unless I mention them.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s good you’re advocating for yourself and getting it checked out. Living alone can make it harder to notice changes, and it's important to pay attention to those subtle shifts. Let’s talk a little bit more about this shortness of breath. Does it happen with exertion, like walking up stairs, or does it come on even when you're resting?
PATIENT: It’s mostly with exertion, I think. Walking up stairs definitely gets me winded faster than it used to. And even carrying groceries, things like that. I haven’t noticed it just… happening at rest, if that makes sense. I mean, I get tired, of course, but not specifically short of breath when I’m sitting still.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful to know. So, exertion-related shortness of breath, no issues at rest. Now, have you noticed any changes in your vision?
PATIENT: Changes in my vision… hmm. That’s a good question. I wear glasses, for nearsightedness, have since I was a teenager. I’ve had my usual check-ups, and they haven’t changed my prescription recently. But… now that you mention it, sometimes things seem a little blurry, not like I need a stronger prescription, just… a little off. And my eyes feel more tired at the end of the day, if that makes sense. It could just be the screens, I suppose. I work in facilities management, so I spend a lot of time on a computer.
DOCTOR: Okay, so some blurry vision and eye fatigue, potentially related to screen time, but a recent stable glasses prescription. Good information. Let’s move on to some other things. Have you noticed any difficulty with swallowing or speaking?
PATIENT: No, not really. Swallowing is fine, and I haven’t had any trouble speaking. People haven’t commented on my voice sounding different, or anything like that. I… I suppose I've been a bit quieter lately, but that’s probably just because I’m tired all the time. I don't want to bother people with my complaints.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. No difficulty swallowing or speaking. Now, have you had any fever, unexplained weight loss, or night sweats recently?
PATIENT: No fever. And I… I think I might have lost a little weight, but I haven’t been weighing myself regularly. Honestly, I've just been eating less because I don’t have much appetite when I'm tired. And no night sweats, no. I sleep pretty normally, actually, when I can get to sleep. It just takes me a while to fall asleep sometimes, I think. I don’t usually remember having bad dreams or anything.
DOCTOR: Okay, no fever, no night sweats, possible slight weight loss related to decreased appetite, and some difficulty falling asleep. Let's talk a little about your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions that you are aware of?
PATIENT: Well, not really. I had chickenpox as a child, and I’ve had the usual colds and flu. My blood pressure is usually a little on the high side, but my doctor hasn’t put me on medication for it yet. He just tells me to watch my salt intake and try to relax more. I had my appendix out when I was a teenager, but that was years ago and I’ve had no problems since. Otherwise… no, I don’t think so. I've never been a particularly sickly person.
DOCTOR: Okay, a history of chickenpox, appendectomy as a teenager, and slightly elevated blood pressure, but currently unmedicated. Good to know. Any surgeries besides the appendectomy?
PATIENT: No, nothing else. Just the appendix. And… I’ve broken a bone or two as a kid, nothing major. A wrist, an arm… typical childhood stuff. But no surgeries besides the appendectomy. I avoid hospitals if I can, to be honest. They always make me anxious.
DOCTOR: Okay, no other surgeries, just childhood fractures. Now, what about your family history?
PATIENT: Hmm. My mother had… arthritis, I think. Badly, towards the end of her life. And my father had heart problems, he died of a heart attack when he was in his sixties. I don’t really know much about my grandparents’ medical history. They both died when I was very young. My siblings are healthy, as far as I know. We don’t really talk much about health. It's a Swedish thing, I suppose, to not bother others with complaints.
DOCTOR: Okay, a family history of arthritis in your mother and heart problems in your father. Good to know. And what about your social history?
PATIENT: Social history? Oh. Well, I’m divorced, as I mentioned. I live alone. I work in facilities management, so I’m mostly around buildings and computers. I don’t smoke, never have. I drink… occasionally. A glass of wine with dinner sometimes, but not every day. I used to be more active, played soccer when I was younger, but I haven't really had the energy lately. I suppose I mostly just… watch television in the evenings. It’s not a very exciting life, I admit.
DOCTOR: Okay, divorced, living alone, working in facilities management, non-smoker, occasional alcohol use, and decreased physical activity. Good to know. One last thing – are you currently taking any medications, and do you have any allergies?
PATIENT: No medications. Just the occasional ibuprofen for a headache, but that’s it. And… no allergies that I’m aware of. I've never had a reaction to anything. I can eat shellfish, I’ve tried all sorts of things. I don't think I'm allergic to anything.
DOCTOR: Okay, no current medications, occasional ibuprofen use, and no known allergies. Thank you, Gedalya. That's a lot of helpful information. Based on what you've told me – the progressive weakness, drooping eyelids, shortness of breath with exertion, fatigue – it sounds like we need to investigate this further. There are a few possibilities that come to mind, and we'll need some tests to narrow it down. I'm thinking we should start with some bloodwork, and I'd like to do a neurological exam to check your reflexes, muscle strength, and coordination. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, absolutely. That sounds… sensible. Bloodwork and an exam, yes. I just want to know what's going on, honestly. I don't like feeling like this. So, whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgment. What do we need to do first?
DOCTOR: Good. I understand. It’s good you’re being proactive. The bloodwork will help rule out some common causes of muscle weakness and fatigue. It's a standard panel, nothing too invasive. And the neurological exam is just a way for me to assess how your nervous system is functioning. It won't take long, and it won't be painful. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, and then I’ll do the neurological exam. After that, I’ll draw some blood. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly fine. Heart and lungs, then the exam, then bloodwork. I’m ready whenever you are, Doctor. Honestly, I'm just glad we're doing something about this. It’s been… unsettling, not knowing what's happening.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. It’s always best to get things checked out, and you're doing the right thing. Alright, let’s start with your heart and lungs. Please lie back on the exam table if you don’t mind. I’ll need you to take a few deep breaths while I listen. Heart sounds are regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops noted. Lung sounds are clear to auscultation bilaterally, no wheezes, crackles, or rhonchi appreciated. Normal effort of breathing.
PATIENT: Okay. Yes, that's… good to hear, I suppose. Everything sounds normal? I always worry about my blood pressure, but you didn't mention anything about that. Is that alright?
DOCTOR: Everything does sound normal, Gedalya. And your blood pressure is slightly elevated, as you suspected—138/82—but not alarmingly so. We can monitor it over time, and discuss lifestyle modifications if needed. For now, it's not a major concern. Now, let's move on to the neurological exam. I'm going to assess your reflexes, muscle strength, and coordination. This will involve a few simple tests. Please relax, and just follow my instructions. Let's start with your reflexes. I'm going to tap on your tendons with this small hammer. This is normal and shouldn’t be painful. Patellar and Achilles reflexes are 2+ bilaterally, which is normal. Biceps and triceps reflexes are also 2+ bilaterally. No clonus noted.
PATIENT: Okay. 2+… is that good? I don’t really understand all the numbers. As long as it's not bad, that's what matters, right? I always feel a bit foolish when doctors use all these technical terms. I just want to know if something is wrong.
DOCTOR: You're absolutely right to ask. 2+ reflexes are perfectly normal – it means they're present and within the expected range. It’s just a way we document our findings. It’s good that they’re normal. Now, let's check your muscle strength. I'm going to ask you to resist my strength as I try to move your arms and legs. Please push back against me as hard as you can. Strength is 5/5 in all extremities. That means you have full strength in your arms and legs. Good. Now, let’s move onto coordination. I’m going to ask you to touch your finger to your nose, and then touch my finger with yours.
PATIENT: Okay. Touching my nose, then your finger. Is that alright? I'm a bit shaky, but I haven't done this in years. I suppose I'm just nervous. I used to play a lot of soccer when I was younger, so I'm used to using my hands for something else.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s alright. There's a very slight tremor noted in both hands, but it’s not significant at this point. It could be related to anxiety, as you mentioned. Now, let's check your gait. I'm going to ask you to walk a few steps normally, and then I’ll ask you to walk on your heels and then on your toes. Gait is stable, but slightly wider than normal. Balance is intact. No significant ataxia noted. Okay, Gedalya. That completes the neurological exam. Everything seems relatively normal, although there is some slight tremor in your hands and a slightly wider gait. Given your symptoms and the exam findings, I’d like to order some bloodwork. It will include a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, thyroid function tests, and vitamin D levels. I'm also going to add creatine kinase to check for muscle damage and acetylcholine receptor antibodies to rule out Myasthenia Gravis. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… thorough. Bloodwork, all those tests… yes, please. Whatever you think is necessary to find out what's wrong. Myasthenia Gravis… is that serious? I don’t even know what that is. I just want to know what’s going on and hopefully get some relief. Please, go ahead with everything you recommend.
DOCTOR: It is good that we are being thorough. Myasthenia Gravis is an autoimmune disorder that causes muscle weakness. It can be serious, but it's often treatable with medication. However, it's just one possibility, and we need to rule it out or confirm it with the bloodwork. I’ll write up the lab orders now. The lab is just down the hall, and they’ll draw the blood for you. It usually takes a few days to get the results back. Once we have them, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and determine the best course of action. In the meantime, if your symptoms worsen, especially if you experience difficulty breathing or swallowing, please go to the emergency room immediately. Don’t hesitate. Is there anything else I can answer for you right now?
PATIENT: Difficulty breathing or swallowing… okay, I’ll remember that. No, I don’t think so. Just… thank you, Doctor. Thank you for taking the time to listen and for being so thorough. I feel a little better knowing that we’re doing something about this. I’ll go down to the lab and get the bloodwork done.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Gedalya. I’m glad I could help. Don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. Take care, and I'll see you at your follow-up appointment.
