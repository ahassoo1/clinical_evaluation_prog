DOCTOR: Alright, Zelina Ambris, 18 years old. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Ugh, finally. Look, it’s my breath. It smells bad. Really bad. I need something for it, and I don’t have all day.
DOCTOR: “Something for it,” right. Well, “something” isn’t a medical term, Zelina. We need to figure out why it smells bad. Has this been a recent thing, or has it been going on for a while?
PATIENT: Honestly? I don’t keep track of these things. Probably a while. I mean, it’s not like I’m sniffing my own breath all day, okay? It just…is. And it’s embarrassing. Is that enough for you? It’s probably just…stuff. You know? From eating.
DOCTOR: “Stuff from eating.” Okay. Look, even “stuff from eating” can point to things. Do you brush your teeth regularly?
PATIENT: Do I look like someone who doesn’t brush their teeth? Of course I do. It’s not like I’m walking around with…plaque. I just…it doesn’t help. I brush, I floss… sometimes. It’s still bad. Look, can we just skip to the part where you give me a mint or something? Or a spray? Anything?
DOCTOR: A mint isn’t going to solve the underlying problem, Zelina. We need to rule out some things. Let’s start with this: have you had any recent dental work?
PATIENT: Dental work? No. Why would I go to the dentist if I can just…deal with it? It’s expensive and time-consuming. Look, I work on the highway, okay? I don’t have time for appointments. Is this going somewhere, or are we just going to ask me about my personal life all day?
DOCTOR: Well, “dealing with it” can lead to bigger problems. And frankly, highway work or not, ignoring something like this isn't smart. Alright. Let's try this. Any nausea, vomiting, or changes in your taste?
PATIENT: Ugh, no. Look, I eat normal food. Sometimes it’s fast food, sometimes it’s…whatever’s quick. I'm not sick or anything. I just want this fixed. This is ridiculous. Are you even a real doctor?
DOCTOR: Let's not get accusatory, Zelina. I am a real doctor, and I'm trying to get to the bottom of this. Have you noticed any white coating on your tongue?
PATIENT: White coating? I don’t… I haven't looked, okay? I don't spend my evenings examining my tongue. Honestly, this is a waste of my time. I’m a grown woman. I can tell you my breath smells bad. Just give me something for it! Is that so hard?
DOCTOR: Look, I’m going to need to look at your mouth, Zelina. It's part of the exam. And I need you to answer my questions honestly. Now, open wide, please. And please, try to be cooperative. This will be much faster if you just work with me.
PATIENT: Fine. But hurry up. And don’t judge me, okay? Just get it over with.
DOCTOR: Hmm. There is a significant amount of debris on your teeth and gums. And yes, some white coating on the back of your tongue. Your gums are also slightly inflamed, and there's some bleeding when I gently probe. Alright. I’m going to document this as gingivitis, likely with some degree of periodontitis starting. Not a surprise, given the…lack of consistent oral hygiene. You need to brush at least twice a day, floss daily, and consider an antibacterial mouthwash. But honestly, Zelina, you really need to see a dentist. This is beyond what I can treat here.
PATIENT: A dentist?! Seriously? I thought you could just…give me something. Look, I don't have the money for a dentist. And I’m not going to spend hours in a chair getting poked and prodded. Is there anything else? Like…a really strong mouthwash? Or something? This is just great. Now I have to deal with another appointment. .
DOCTOR: Look, I understand money is tight, but neglecting your dental health will only lead to more expensive problems down the line. I can recommend a few low-cost dental clinics in the area, if you'd like. For now, I can prescribe a chlorhexidine mouthwash, which will help reduce the bacteria causing the odor. But this is temporary. Use it twice daily, as directed, and understand it can stain your teeth a bit. And seriously, Zelina, I strongly urge you to schedule a dental appointment. Here. This will help with the smell, but it's not a solution. It’s a band-aid. Do you have any questions about the mouthwash?
