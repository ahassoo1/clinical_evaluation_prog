DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Sugino. I am Dr. Eaddy. It is a pleasure to meet you. Now, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, I've been thinking… I'm interested in learning about mindfulness or meditation. I hear it can be really helpful, and honestly, life feels a little… much sometimes. I thought maybe you could point me in the right direction, or tell me if it’s even a good idea for someone like me.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Mindfulness. I see. While I am a physician specializing in Internal Medicine, and certainly appreciate a holistic approach to wellness, I must admit this isn’t a typical consultation request. However, I suppose we can discuss it briefly. To better understand your situation, could you elaborate on what makes life feel "much," as you put it?
PATIENT: Oh, I didn’t mean to be strange! I just figured it wouldn’t hurt to ask. You're right, it's not a cough or a broken bone. Well… it’s my job, mostly. Being a signal and track repairer… it’s very detail-oriented, you know? High pressure. One small mistake… well, you can imagine. And then, outside of work… I just feel… scattered. I worry a lot. I don’t sleep particularly well, either. It’s just a general feeling of being… overwhelmed. It's not debilitating, just… persistent. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that clarifies things somewhat. A demanding profession, coupled with anxiety… It's not uncommon, certainly. Though, as I stated, outside of my specific expertise, I am hesitant to offer guidance on practices like mindfulness without a proper psychological assessment. Have you ever considered speaking with a therapist or counselor, Ms. Sugino?
PATIENT: That's perfectly reasonable, Doctor. I hadn't really thought about a therapist, to be honest. I thought maybe mindfulness was something I could just… start doing. I suppose it wouldn't hurt. Do you have any recommendations? Perhaps someone who understands… well, someone who understands the kind of stress that comes with a job where things have to be right? Because if a signal switch is off by a millimeter… well. It’s not like a bad haircut, you know?
DOCTOR: Indeed, a rather different situation than a cosmetic issue. Fortunately, our clinic does maintain a list of qualified mental health professionals in the area. I can have the receptionist provide you with several names and contact numbers. They specialize in various modalities, and I’m certain you can find someone suitable. Before we proceed with that, however, I believe it prudent to rule out any underlying medical contributions to your anxiety and sleep disturbances. While psychological factors are often paramount, we must address potential physiological causes as well. Have you noticed any other symptoms – perhaps palpitations, dizziness, unexplained fatigue, or changes in appetite?
PATIENT: That sounds like a good idea, Doctor. It’s best to be thorough. And yes, actually… now that you mention it, I have been feeling a little more tired than usual lately. Not all the time, but… a kind of bone-deep exhaustion. And sometimes, my heart feels like it’s fluttering, especially if I’ve had a particularly stressful day at work. It doesn’t last long, just a few seconds, but it’s… unsettling. My appetite hasn't really changed, though. I still eat pretty well, I think. Though I do drink a lot of coffee to get through the day. Probably too much, if I'm honest.
DOCTOR: Palpitations and fatigue… and a significant caffeine intake. Very well. We should investigate this further. I’d like to order a complete blood count, a basic metabolic panel, and an electrocardiogram – an ECG – to assess your heart function. These tests will help us determine if there’s an underlying medical cause for your symptoms. In the meantime, I would advise you to gradually reduce your coffee consumption. It may be contributing to your anxiety and palpitations. Perhaps switch to decaffeinated alternatives or herbal teas. Do you have any allergies to medications or contrast dyes?
PATIENT: No allergies, Doctor. Nothing at all. And okay, I can definitely try to cut back on the coffee. It’s going to be hard, but… you’re right, probably a good idea. So, blood tests and an ECG… and then we see what those say? Is that right? How long does all that take? I have a fairly busy schedule with work, so I’d like to plan around it if possible. And do I need to do anything to prepare for the ECG? Like, avoid caffeine for a certain amount of time?
DOCTOR: Yes, that is correct. Blood tests and an ECG. The blood tests can be completed at the lab directly across the hall; they generally take about fifteen minutes, and you do not need to fast beforehand. As for the ECG, yes, it is best to avoid caffeine for at least six hours prior to the test. It can affect the results, as you correctly surmise. Our scheduling department can arrange a time that accommodates your work schedule. They are quite efficient, and I’m confident they can find a suitable appointment. While we await the results, I would also like you to keep a brief log of your symptoms – when they occur, how severe they are, and any potential triggers you can identify. This information will be valuable in formulating a treatment plan. Do you have any questions for me at this point, Ms. Sugino?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s all pretty clear, Doctor. Thank you for explaining everything so thoroughly. A symptom log… okay, I can do that. And yes, scheduling can definitely find a time. I’m usually free after five on weekdays, or pretty much any time on the weekend. I really appreciate you taking the time to listen to me, even though it’s not… a typical problem. It's nice to just feel like someone is taking it seriously. So, I’ll head across the hall for the blood work, and then call to schedule the ECG?
DOCTOR: Precisely. Head across the hall for the blood work, and then contact the scheduling department to arrange your ECG appointment. They are located just past the reception desk. And please, do not hesitate to contact the clinic if you experience any new or worsening symptoms while you await your results. We are here to assist you. Thank you for coming in today, Ms. Sugino. I look forward to reviewing your test results and developing a plan to address your concerns. .
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor Eaddy. I appreciate it very much. .
