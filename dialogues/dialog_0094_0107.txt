DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Puder. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Gegan. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Umm... my heart. It feels... funny sometimes. Like it's beating too fast, but not always. It’s been happening for a little while now.
DOCTOR: Okay, “funny” – can you describe that feeling a little more specifically?
PATIENT: Like... a flapping? Not pain, not really. Just... a quick, strong beat. And then it goes back to normal. It doesn't last long, maybe a few seconds. Sometimes I feel a little dizzy when it happens. It scares my wife.
DOCTOR: I understand. A flapping sensation, quick and strong beats, and sometimes dizziness. That does sound concerning, and it’s good you’re getting it checked out, and that your wife is supportive. How long has this been going on for, roughly?
PATIENT: Hmm... maybe three months now? It started not very often, just once or twice a week. Now it's... maybe three or four times a week? Sometimes more if I walk a lot. Like, up a hill. It doesn't happen when I'm resting.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it's been progressively getting more frequent over the last three months, and it seems to be related to exertion. That's helpful to know. Have you noticed anything else that seems to trigger it, besides walking or physical activity?
PATIENT: Umm... no, not really. I tried to think. Maybe if I drink too much tea? But I drink tea every day. It's hard to say. I don't think so. No, I don't think anything else. Just walking. And maybe a little with the tea.
DOCTOR: Alright. And how much tea would you say you drink in a day, roughly?
PATIENT: Oh, maybe four or five cups? Small cups. Not big mugs. Yemeni tea, you know? Strong tea. We drink it a lot. Everyone drinks it.
DOCTOR: Yes, I’m familiar with Yemeni tea; it is quite strong. Four or five cups a day is good to know. Now, let's talk about other symptoms. Have you noticed any shortness of breath, chest pain—separate from the palpitations—lightheadedness, or unexplained sweating when this happens?
PATIENT: No pain, definitely not. Shortness of breath, sometimes a little, but only when I'm walking and my heart is doing the flapping. Like, I have to stop for a second. Lightheadedness... maybe. A little dizzy, I said before. Sweating... no, not really. Just a little warm, maybe. Not a lot of sweating.
DOCTOR: Okay, so some shortness of breath with exertion and palpitations, and a little lightheadedness. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions before – like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: No, never. Nothing. I've been pretty healthy, I think. I go to the market every day, walk a lot. My wife worries too much. She says I should rest more. I don’t have insurance, so I don't go to the doctor unless I really need to.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's good you've generally been healthy. And I appreciate you being upfront about not having insurance; that's important for me to know as we discuss options. Now, have you ever had any surgeries, or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No surgeries. Never been in the hospital. I broke my arm when I was a little boy, but that's it. My mother fixed it with herbs. It healed good, she was a very good healer. But no hospital, no surgeries.
DOCTOR: Okay, no surgeries or hospitalizations. And how about your family?
PATIENT: Family? Umm… my father, he had problems with his legs when he got old. Swelling. But nothing with his heart, I don't think. My mother, she lived to be very old, very healthy. My brother, he has high blood pressure, I think. He takes pills for it. That's all I know. We don't talk much.
DOCTOR: Okay, so some leg swelling in your father and high blood pressure in your brother. That's helpful to know. Now, just a few more quick questions. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No smoking. No alcohol. Never. And definitely no drugs. I drink tea, that's it. My wife would be very angry if I did.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. And are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or herbal supplements?
PATIENT: No. Just tea. Nothing else. My wife gives me some honey sometimes when I have a cold, but that's it. She takes care of me.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Puder. Thank you for providing me with all of that information. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure and pulse, and take a look at your overall health. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s okay. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust you.
DOCTOR: Okay. If you could please lie back on the examination table, that would be great. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs first. Please let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. Your heart rate is a bit fast, 98 beats per minute, and the rhythm is regular. I am hearing no murmurs or extra sounds. Your lungs are clear, I'm not detecting any wheezing or crackles. Your blood pressure is 140/90. That's a little elevated. Your pulse is strong and regular. Now, I'm just going to quickly check your thyroid gland. Your thyroid feels normal. Everything else appears to be within normal limits. Now, based on your symptoms and this exam, it sounds like you are experiencing palpitations, possibly related to your caffeine intake and slightly elevated blood pressure. However, we need to rule out other potential causes. I recommend we get an EKG – an electrocardiogram – to assess your heart's electrical activity. We should also do some blood work to check your electrolytes, thyroid function, and overall health. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Okay... EKG and blood work. Sounds… okay. I don’t know what those things are, but if you think it’s best… yes. Will it cost a lot of money? Because… I don’t have insurance.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern about the cost, Mr. Puder. That's a very valid question. The EKG itself is relatively inexpensive, usually around $50-$100. The blood work will be a bit more, perhaps $75 - $150, depending on what we test for. I will work with the lab to see if we can get a discounted rate for you, given your lack of insurance. We can also prioritize the tests to only include the most essential ones initially, and add more if needed. I want to assure you that we'll do our best to keep the costs as low as possible. This EKG and blood work will help us determine if there's a more serious underlying cause for your palpitations, or if it's simply related to caffeine intake and stress. Would you like me to proceed with ordering those tests?
PATIENT: Yes, please. Do the most important ones first, if that’s okay. And try to get the best price you can. Thank you, Doctor. You’re very kind. I worry about my wife. She works very hard. I don't want anything to happen to me.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Puder. I understand your concern for your wife, and we will absolutely prioritize the most essential tests and work towards the best possible price. Okay, I'll write the orders for an EKG, a Complete Blood Count , a Basic Metabolic Panel , and a Thyroid Stimulating Hormone test. The lab is just down the hall, and the technician will be expecting you. Once they're done, they'll send the results directly to me. I’ll review them as soon as they’re available and contact you with the findings. In the meantime, I recommend reducing your caffeine intake – perhaps switching to decaffeinated tea, or limiting yourself to one cup a day. Also, try to manage your stress levels as much as possible. Do you have any questions for me before you head to the lab?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. Decaf tea... okay. And try to relax. It’s hard to relax when you worry, but I’ll try. Thank you very much, Doctor. I appreciate your help.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Puder. It’s completely understandable to feel anxious, and I’m here to help in any way I can. Please don’t hesitate to call the clinic if you have any concerns before I get back to you with the results. The lab technician will take good care of you. Have a good day, and I’ll be in touch soon.
