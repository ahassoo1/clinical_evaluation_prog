DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Brege. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Giganti. It’s nice to meet you. To start, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doc. Just call me Clide. Been havin' this fever come and go, see? It's been botherin' me for a little while now. Not sure what's causin' it, honestly. Just wanna get it checked out.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Clide. It’s good to meet you as well. A fever that comes and goes is definitely something we should look into. When you say “a little while,” could you give me a more specific timeframe?
PATIENT: Hmm... let me think. It started... oh, around the end of June, I reckon. Maybe the first week of July? It'll come on strong for a day or two, then disappear for a bit, then pop back up. It's kinda random, really. Not every week, not every few days... just when it feels like it, I guess.
DOCTOR: Okay, so roughly a month or so. And you mentioned it comes on “strong” – can you describe what that feels like?
PATIENT: Well, I get real chills, you know? Like, shiverin' even under a blanket. Then I get hot, forehead feels like a fire. Usually a headache with it too, right behind my eyes. Makes me just wanna lie down. And tired, Doc. Real tired. Just wiped out. Not like normal tired, like really drained.
DOCTOR: I understand. Chills, fever, headache, and significant fatigue – those are all important symptoms. Have you been taking your temperature when you feel the fever coming on?
PATIENT: Yeah, my wife, Elena, she makes me. She's a worrier, bless her heart. I got one of those digital ones. Usually around 101, 102 when it's bad. Sometimes a little higher, but not too much. She writes it all down, too. Everything.
DOCTOR: That’s good of Elena to monitor that for you, and helpful that she's keeping a record. Do you know if she brought that record with her today?
PATIENT: Oh, yeah, she always does. She's got a little notebook, all neat and organized. It's in her purse, I think. She'll probably pull it out any second now, actually. She's very thorough, that woman.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you could hand it to me when you have a moment, that would be great. While we’re waiting for that, let's talk a bit more about what’s been going on besides the fever. Have you noticed any other symptoms – cough, body aches, sore throat, nausea, diarrhea, anything like that?
PATIENT: Let me see... no cough, thankfully. No sore throat either. Sometimes my muscles feel a little achy, but that's just my age, I figure. I had a little bit of nausea one time, but that could've been somethin' I ate. No diarrhea, no… nothin’ else, really. Just the fever and feelin' wiped out. Honestly, Doc, I just want to know why I keep gettin' this thing. It's makin' me nervous.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Clide. It’s good we’re narrowing down the possibilities. Now, let’s talk a little about your medical history. Do you have any ongoing medical conditions, like diabetes, heart problems, or anything else I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Nah, nothin' like that. I've been pretty lucky, health-wise. High blood pressure, the doctor told me a few years back, but I watch my salt and it's usually okay. I take a little somethin' for it sometimes, but nothin' regular. Other than that… no, Doc. Just the usual aches and pains of gettin' old. And this fever, of course. Elena keeps tellin' me to go see a specialist, but I don't like runnin' around to a bunch of doctors. Just want this fixed.
DOCTOR: Okay, so managed hypertension. And you only take medication for it occasionally. That's good to know. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Nope. Never had surgery. Never been in the hospital, knock on wood. I broke my arm when I was a kid, playin' ball, but that was it. Just a cast, healed right up. No serious illnesses, nothin’ like that. I've always been a pretty strong guy. This fever… it's just weird. It doesn't feel like somethin' I can shake off.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s helpful. Now, let’s talk about your family. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family – heart disease, diabetes, cancer, anything like that?
PATIENT: Hmm... my father, he had heart trouble when he got older. Had to watch his diet, you know? My mother, she had arthritis, real bad in her hands. And my sister, she had… oh, what was it? Not diabetes, somethin’ with her sugar… she's gone now, can't remember exactly. But yeah, heart trouble and arthritis mostly. Not much else that I can recall, honestly. We weren't a family that talked about health much.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a family history of heart disease and arthritis. That's good to know. And now, just a few more questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Nope, nothin' like that. Never smoked a day in my life. Elena doesn’t allow it. I might have a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, on a special occasion, but not much. And definitely no drugs. I'm an old man, Doc. I just wanna relax and watch my baseball. This fever is makin' it hard to enjoy even that.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s good to know. And finally, do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope. Not that I know of. Elena always asks me that when she makes me take somethin', and I always tell her no. Never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. Just a regular guy, Doc. This fever... it's the only thing botherin' me. I'm startin' to think it's somethin' serious.
DOCTOR: Okay, Clide. Thank you for sharing all of that information with me. It’s very helpful. Now, if you don’t mind, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your temperature and blood pressure, and feel your abdomen. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, sure, Doc. Whatever you need to do. I just wanna figure out what's goin' on. Go ahead. I'm ready when you are. Just try not to poke too much, my back's been achin' a little lately.
DOCTOR: Alright, I’ll be gentle. First, let's take your temperature. 101.2 Fahrenheit. And let me listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear, no wheezing or crackles. Abdomen is soft, no tenderness. Blood pressure is 140/90. A bit elevated, but consistent with his history. Do you feel any pain anywhere specifically when I press here?
PATIENT: Nope, not really. A little uncomfortable, maybe, but no sharp pain. Like I said, my back's been botherin' me, but that's just old age, I reckon. Is somethin' wrong, Doc? Is it somethin' serious? Elena's gonna be worried if you say somethin' bad. She worries about everything.
DOCTOR: Alright, Clide. The exam findings aren’t immediately alarming, but your blood pressure is a little high, and the recurring fever is concerning. Given your symptoms – the intermittent fever, chills, headache, and fatigue – and considering your family history, there are a few possibilities we need to investigate. It could be a viral infection, but we need to rule out other things. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order some blood work. A complete blood count will tell us if there’s an infection, and we can also check your electrolytes and kidney function. I’d also like to do a basic metabolic panel. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Blood work, huh? Elena's gonna say I told you so. She always says I should get more tests. Alright, Doc. If you think it's necessary, go ahead. Just try to make it quick, okay? I hate needles. And tell me what it means, everything. I don't want to be left in the dark. Is it gonna be expensive? I ain't got insurance, you know.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Clide. We’ll try to make it as quick and comfortable as possible. As for the cost, I’ll have the billing department give you a breakdown of the charges. We can also discuss potential financial assistance options if needed. The blood work will help us rule out some of the more serious possibilities and get a better understanding of what’s going on. I’ll explain the results to you in detail once they are available. It usually takes a couple of days to get them back. In the meantime, I recommend you drink plenty of fluids, get plenty of rest, and avoid strenuous activity. If your fever gets significantly higher or you develop any new symptoms like shortness of breath or chest pain, please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers it, Doc. Just get it over with, and hopefully it's nothin' too serious. I just wanna get back to watchin' baseball. And tell Elena I said hello. She's probably already callin' the office. Where do we go for the blood work?
DOCTOR: Alright, Clide. I understand. The lab is just down the hall, room 203. The phlebotomist, Maria, is very good, and she'll take good care of you. She'll draw a few vials of blood, and it should only take about 15-20 minutes. Once you’ve had the blood work done, let the receptionist know, and they’ll schedule a follow-up appointment with me to discuss the results. In the meantime, if anything changes or you become concerned, don’t hesitate to call the office. I’ll have the nurse give you a printed summary of today's visit and instructions for the blood work. Thank you for coming in today. We’ll do our best to get to the bottom of this.
PATIENT: Alright, Doc. Thanks for your help. I'll go get it done. Tell Elena to stop worryin' so much, will ya? She's a good woman, but she drives me crazy sometimes. .
