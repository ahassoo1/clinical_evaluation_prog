DOCTOR: Good morning, Nadene. It's lovely to meet you. My name is Dr. Lahn. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you as well. Well, it’s this cough. It just won't go away, and my heart… it hasn’t been feeling the best lately either. It feels a little weaker than usual, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, a cough and some heart palpitations, or a feeling of weakness. Thank you for letting me know. Let's start with the cough. How long have you had it?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… it started, I believe, sometime in late June. Maybe the first week? It’s been… close to six weeks now, maybe a little longer. At first, it wasn’t so bad, just a tickle, really. But now it's… more persistent. Especially when I lie down.
DOCTOR: Okay, so about six weeks, starting in late June and worsening over time, especially when lying down. Do you notice anything that specifically makes it worse, besides lying down?
PATIENT: Hmm… well, if I eat too much salt, it seems to bother it. And sometimes, if it's very cold outside and I breathe in that cold air, it really sets it off. But mostly lying down, yes. And it’s… a dry cough, not much mucus, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. A dry cough, worsened by salt intake and cold air, and particularly when lying down. That’s helpful information. And regarding the heart – you mentioned it hasn’t been feeling the best. Can you describe that feeling a little more?
PATIENT: Well, it's not a pain, exactly. It’s more like… a tiredness. Like it has to work harder to do its job. And sometimes, I feel a little… fluttery, you know? Like a bird flapping around in my chest. It doesn't happen all the time, but it’s enough to worry me. I used to walk to the market every day, but now I get winded just going up the stairs.
DOCTOR: Okay, a tiredness and a fluttering sensation, and shortness of breath with exertion – like climbing stairs. Has this shortness of breath been getting progressively worse?
PATIENT: Yes, it definitely has. A year ago, I could walk a mile no problem. Now… just a block feels like too much. And it’s not just the stairs, it’s… even talking sometimes. If I get a little excited, or try to say too many words at once, I have to stop and catch my breath. It’s… frustrating.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Nadene. It sounds concerning to have that level of shortness of breath developing over time. Before we move on, do you have any swelling in your ankles or feet?
PATIENT: Oh, yes! That's been happening too, actually. Not all the time, but at the end of the day, especially if it's warm, my ankles get quite puffy. I thought it was just the heat at first, but it’s been happening more and more often lately. My shoes feel a little tighter, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, ankle swelling that's worse at the end of the day and with warmer temperatures. Thank you for telling me. Now, let’s talk a bit about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past, like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, plenty. Let's see... Years ago, the doctor told me I had high blood pressure, and I take pills for that. And I was diagnosed with something with my heart, a long time ago now... congestive heart failure, I think that's what they called it. I’ve been seeing a cardiologist for years, but I haven’t been to him in… well, probably too long. About a year. I also had a bit of trouble with my sugar levels a few years back, but the doctor said it was pre-diabetes and I managed to get it under control with diet.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of high blood pressure, congestive heart failure, and pre-diabetes, which was managed with diet. Do you remember what medications you're currently taking for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Let me think... Oh, yes, I have it right here. I take lisinopril, 20 milligrams every day. And hydrochlorothiazide, 25 milligrams, also every day. And a little white pill... furosemide, 40 milligrams, for the swelling. That one’s important, I think, because of the fluid.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Nadene. That's very helpful. And do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else, like food or environmental allergens?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything. I eat everything! And I haven’t been around any bees or anything like that in years. I used to be a little sensitive to dust, but that was when I was a young girl, and it doesn’t bother me anymore.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. And just to complete the picture, have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Let me see... Hmm. I had my gallbladder out a long time ago. And… oh, yes! When I broke my wrist a few years back, I had surgery to fix it. That was a bit of a bother, but it healed up alright. Nothing else that I can remember. It was a long time ago, you know.
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder removal and surgery for a broken wrist. Finally, let's talk a little bit about your family. Is there a family history of heart disease, high blood pressure, diabetes, or any other significant medical conditions?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, quite a bit. My mother had high blood pressure, and she passed away from a stroke. My father had diabetes, and his brother… he had a bad heart. He died young, I think. And my sister, she has high cholesterol. So, yes, there's a lot of heart trouble on both sides of the family, I'm afraid.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Nadene. That’s a lot of helpful information. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if you don’t mind. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your ankles to see about that swelling. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds just fine, Doctor. Go right ahead. I'm used to doctors, you know. Always something or other needing looking at.
DOCTOR: Okay, Nadene. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, 160/90. I hear some crackling sounds in your lungs, which could indicate fluid buildup. Your heart sounds a little irregular, and I can definitely see some swelling in your ankles. I’ll also feel your pulse. It feels a bit weak. Overall, these findings are consistent with worsening heart failure, and potentially some fluid overload. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to order some blood tests, including a complete blood count, a basic metabolic panel, and a BNP level, which helps assess heart failure. I also recommend an EKG to look at the electrical activity of your heart. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That doesn't sound very good, does it? Weak heart and fluid… It’s probably been getting worse, I just didn’t want to admit it. Yes, yes, of course, do whatever you think is best, Doctor. Blood tests and… whatever that EKG is. If it will help me feel better, I’m happy to have them done. Do I need to fast for the blood tests?
DOCTOR: Yes, you will need to fast for at least 8 hours before the blood tests – that means no food or drink except water. We can get those scheduled for tomorrow morning. And the EKG is quick and painless – it just involves placing some stickers on your chest. We can do that right away after the blood work. In the meantime, I want you to limit your salt intake as much as possible and monitor your weight daily. If you notice a sudden weight gain, or if your shortness of breath gets significantly worse, please call the office immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No salt… that’s going to be hard, I love my cooking. But I understand, Doctor. Limit salt, watch my weight, call if it gets worse. Yes, I can do that. One question… will I have to come back to see the cardiologist again? I haven’t seen him in a while and… well, I don't enjoy those visits.
DOCTOR: That's a valid concern, Nadene. Given your history and these recent findings, I do recommend a follow-up with your cardiologist. They can provide more specialized care and potentially adjust your medications if needed. I can help facilitate that referral, and we can discuss any concerns you have about the appointment beforehand. Would you like me to go ahead and schedule that for you?
PATIENT: Yes, please, that would be wonderful. If you can help with that, I'd appreciate it very much. I just… I get a little nervous going to specialists. They always seem so… serious. But if you think it's important, I'll do it. And thank you, Doctor, for explaining everything so clearly. I feel a little better knowing what's going on, even if it's not good news.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Nadene. It's completely understandable to feel nervous about specialist appointments. I will go ahead and get that referral scheduled for you, and I’ll make a note for the cardiologist to reach out to you directly to schedule an appointment. In the meantime, remember to focus on limiting your salt intake and monitoring your weight. We’ll get these tests done tomorrow, and we can discuss the results and a more comprehensive plan when they come back. Do you have any other concerns or questions before we finish up?
PATIENT: No, I think that's everything for now, Doctor. You've been very helpful and kind. I really appreciate you taking the time to listen to me. I'll try my best to follow your instructions. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Nadene. I’m glad I could help. Please don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your appointment tomorrow. We’re here to support you. I’ll see you then.
