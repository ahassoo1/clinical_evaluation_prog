DOCTOR: Good morning, Leander. Welcome. I'm Dr. Renzi. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Uh… right. My ear. It feels… full. Like it’s blocked, you know? Honestly, I don’t remember exactly when it started. Things haven’t been… clear lately. It’s just… annoying, mostly.
DOCTOR: Okay, “fullness” in the ear, and you’re having trouble pinpointing when it began. That’s alright, we’ll figure it out. It sounds frustrating. Is it just one ear, or both?
PATIENT: Just the left one, I think. Yes, definitely the left. Though… sometimes they both feel a little funny. It comes and goes, you see? It's hard to say for sure what's going on. I really just want it gone, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Alright, primarily the left ear, with occasional feelings in the right. And it’s intermittent – comes and goes. Okay. Have you noticed any pain with it?
PATIENT: Pain? Not really. Not like a sharp pain, no. More… a pressure. Like when you’re flying on an airplane, maybe? But not as bad. Just… uncomfortable. And sometimes a little bit of… ringing, I guess. Not all the time, though. Sorry, I'm not very good at explaining.
DOCTOR: No, that’s perfectly alright! You’re doing great. Pressure, like with airplane descent, and some intermittent ringing… that gives me a bit more to work with. Have you noticed any dizziness, or any change in your hearing at all?
PATIENT: Dizziness… hmm. Maybe a little bit off balance sometimes, but I put that down to… well, getting older, you know? And my hearing… I wouldn’t say it’s worse, exactly. Just… quieter, generally. It's been like that for a while though, not new. My wife used to complain I didn’t listen… Sorry. What were we talking about?
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all, Leander. It sounds like you've noticed a gradual decline in your hearing, which is fairly common as we age. And a bit of imbalance is good to know. Let’s focus on this ear fullness for now. Have you had any recent colds, sinus infections, or allergies that you're aware of?
PATIENT: Colds… allergies… It’s all a bit of a blur, to be honest. I think I had a sniffle a few months back, but nothing serious. The doctor gave me something for it, I think. I really can’t recall. Everything’s just… hazy. I apologize. Is it important?
DOCTOR: It’s alright, truly. We’ll piece things together. Knowing about a recent cold is helpful. Alright. I'd like to take a quick look in your ears. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that's fine. Just… try to be quick, if you wouldn’t mind? I have a few things I need to get to later. And… well, I don’t really like things poking around in my ears, if I'm honest.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I’ll be as quick and gentle as possible. It shouldn’t be uncomfortable, just a quick peek. Okay… I see some slight redness inside the ear canal, and a little bit of wax buildup. The eardrum itself looks intact, but a little… dull. And the right ear looks pretty normal. Some wax, but nothing concerning. It sounds like you might have a bit of fluid buildup in your middle ear, possibly due to some congestion. The wax buildup could also be contributing to the fullness. We can try to remove some of the wax and see if that helps relieve the pressure. Would you be okay with me doing that now?
PATIENT: Fluid… wax… Yes, alright. If you think it will help, please do. I just want this gone. Do what you need to do. Quickly, if you can. I have appointments, you see. .
DOCTOR: Alright, Leander. Just relax, and I'll be as efficient as possible. This might feel a little cool or strange, but it shouldn't be painful. Okay, I'm gently loosening some of the wax now… there's a good amount in here. And… there we go. I'm removing it gradually. Okay, a little more… Alright, I've removed the bulk of the wax. Let's see if that provides any relief. I'm going to check your hearing briefly now with some simple tests. Okay, your hearing seems a little reduced in the left ear, but not significantly. The tuning fork test also suggests some fluid behind the eardrum. So, it seems likely you have a mild fluid buildup in your middle ear, potentially from a recent cold or some minor congestion, and the wax buildup was certainly contributing to the problem. I’m going to prescribe some nasal decongestant spray and recommend some over-the-counter pain relief if you feel any discomfort. We can re-evaluate in two weeks if it doesn’t improve. Does that sound alright to you?
