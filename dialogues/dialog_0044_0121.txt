DOCTOR: Good morning, Andrew. It’s a pleasure to meet you. I’m Dr. Asami. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doc. Just… my eyes. They feel real dry. Been that way a while now, I guess. Don't feel good. I just want somethin’ for ‘em, if you got somethin’.
DOCTOR: Okay, dry eyes. I understand. It’s good you came in to get it checked out – it’s a common problem, and we definitely have options. “Been that way a while now” is helpful – can you tell me a bit more about how long exactly?
PATIENT: Hmm… a while. Maybe… six months? Longer? Hard to say, really. Things kinda blend together when you get old, ya know? Not gettin’ any younger. It just… slowly got worse. Not sudden.
DOCTOR: I absolutely understand that, Andrew. Time does have a way of blending together. Six months, or longer… that gives us a good starting point. And you said it slowly got worse. Is it constant dryness, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Pretty constant, I think. Worse when I’m workin’, though. All that dust and stuff… cement dust ain’t good for nothin’. Makes it scratchy. Just feel like there’s somethin’ in ‘em all the time.
DOCTOR: Okay, so constant dryness, exacerbated by work and cement dust. That's very helpful information. You mentioned scratching – is there any redness, blurry vision, or discharge associated with it?
PATIENT: Blurry vision sometimes, yeah. Mostly when I'm tired. Redness… not much. Not that I noticed, anyway. And no… nothin’ comin’ out of ‘em. Just… dry. Really dry.
DOCTOR: Alright, Andrew. So, constant dryness, worsening with work, occasional blurry vision when tired, no significant redness or discharge. Have you tried anything already for it – like artificial tears, or any other eye drops?
PATIENT: Nope. Never used nothin’. Always figured it'd just go away. Or maybe I just… put up with it. Didn’t seem worth botherin’ a doc over dry eyes, to be honest.
DOCTOR: I understand that sentiment, Andrew. But sometimes, even seemingly minor things can benefit from a little attention. Let’s take a quick look at your eyes, if you don't mind. I just want to check a few things, and then we can discuss some options. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, alright. Sounds good. Get it over with, I guess. Don't take too long, though. Got things to do.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, we’ll keep it quick. Just going to have you look straight ahead. I'm just checking the surface of your eyes, and then I'll have you follow my finger as I move it around. Okay, Andrew. I'm seeing a bit of dryness on the surface of your eyes, and your tear film seems a little thin. That would certainly explain the discomfort you're feeling. No significant inflammation or other concerning findings. It looks like we're dealing with a case of dry eye disease. Have you ever had any issues with allergies, or any autoimmune conditions?
PATIENT: Auto… what now? Never had nothin’ like that. Allergies… maybe a little hay fever when I was a kid. Nothin' serious. Just sniffled a bit in the spring. Haven't had it in years, though.
DOCTOR: Okay, no significant allergy history or autoimmune conditions. That's good to know. “Hay fever” when you were younger is helpful. Sometimes allergies can contribute to dry eyes. Now, regarding your medications – are you currently taking any prescription or over-the-counter medications, or any supplements?
PATIENT: Nope. Don't take nothin’. Never really been one for pills. Just try to stay active, that's all. Old habits, I guess. Used to work hard all the time.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent, Andrew. Staying active is fantastic. So, no medications or supplements at all. Just to be thorough, do you wear glasses or contacts?
PATIENT: Nope. Eyes are still good enough, I guess. Never needed ‘em. Used to see pretty good. Not as good as I used to, but good enough.
DOCTOR: Okay, no glasses or contacts. Alright, Andrew, we’ve covered a lot of ground. So, to recap: you’ve been experiencing dry eyes for at least six months, worsening with work, occasional blurry vision when tired, no medications, allergies, or significant medical history. Given your symptoms and the examination findings, it sounds like you have dry eye disease, likely related to reduced tear production. We can try a few things to manage it. Have you ever heard of artificial tears?
PATIENT: Artificial… tears? Sounds kinda silly. But… no, I don’t think so. What are they?
DOCTOR: They’re not silly at all, Andrew! They're basically eye drops that add moisture to your eyes, like adding lubricant. Think of them as a little boost for your natural tears. There are many different kinds available, some thicker than others, some with preservatives, some without. We can start with a preservative-free option since you're only using them for dryness. Would you be willing to try those and see if they help?
PATIENT: Preservative-free… sounds better. Don’t need any extra chemicals in my eyes. Yeah, alright. I’ll try ‘em. How often do I… put ‘em in?
DOCTOR: Excellent. Preservative-free is a good choice. You can start by using them as often as you need – typically, 1 to 2 drops in each eye 2 to 4 times a day, or as directed on the bottle. If your eyes feel dry between doses, you can use them more frequently. We'll start with that and see how you respond over the next week or two. If they're not providing enough relief, we can consider other options, like a thicker gel for nighttime use, or potentially a prescription medication. Does that sound like a reasonable plan?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds alright. Just… don’t want to be puttin’ drops in all day, ya know? Got work to do. Just… hope they work.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Andrew. We’ll start conservatively and see what works best for you. We want to minimize disruption to your daily routine. I'll write you a prescription for the preservative-free artificial tears. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Nope. I think that’s it. Just… where do I pick these up?
DOCTOR: You can pick them up at any pharmacy – Walgreens, CVS, even your local grocery store pharmacy should carry them. I'll send the prescription electronically to your preferred pharmacy, so it should be ready within a few hours. I'll also give you a handout with information about dry eye disease and tips for managing your symptoms, like avoiding dry environments and blinking frequently. If your symptoms don’t improve after a week or two, or if they worsen, please don't hesitate to give us a call to schedule a follow-up appointment. Is there anything else I can help you with today, Andrew?
PATIENT: Nope. I think that’s everything. Thanks, Doc. I appreciate it. Hope these drops work.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Andrew. I hope they provide some relief as well. And don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. Take care, and have a good day.
