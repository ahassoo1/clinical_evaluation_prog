DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Miner. I'm Dr. Murtic. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Well, it’s… my face and legs, mostly. They’ve been puffin’ up. Not like, all of a sudden, but… over time, you know? It’s just… bothersome. I can’t really say why it started, though. Old age, probably.
DOCTOR: “Old age,” you say. Right. Well, we don’t just accept “old age” as a diagnosis around here, Mr. Miner. Let’s try to be a bit more specific, shall we?
PATIENT: Specific? What do you want me to tell ya? I wake up, and my face looks… wider. And my ankles? Like sausages. I ain’t a doctor, I weld things. How specific can I get? It just… happened. It’s not like I can pinpoint a day or nothin’. Honestly, seems like a waste of time, if you ask me. Probably just fluid.
DOCTOR: “Just fluid” can be many things, Mr. Miner, and some of them are quite serious. It's good you came in. Now, has this swelling been worse at certain times of the day?
PATIENT: Hmm… Now that you mention it… yeah, I guess it's a bit worse in the evenings. After I've been on my feet all day. Though, to be fair, I’m always on my feet all day. Welding, you know? Not much sittin' around. Don't see how that helps ya figure it out, though. It's just… legs and face. Swollen. Simple as that.
DOCTOR: Worse in the evenings after being on your feet all day… Alright. And do you notice any pain with the swelling?
PATIENT: Pain? Not really pain, no. More… heavy. Like my shoes are too tight, even when they ain’t. And my face… just feels… stretched. Uncomfortable, I suppose. But not like a throbbing pain or anything. It's just… there. Annoying, mostly. You know? I’ve put up with worse from burnin’ myself with the torch, let me tell ya.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's move on to some other things. Do you have any shortness of breath, or have you noticed any changes in how much energy you have lately?
PATIENT: Shortness of breath? No… I mean, I get winded after climbin’ a few stairs, but that’s just… bein’ my age, I reckon. And energy… well, I work long hours. I’m always tired. Can’t say I’ve noticed any difference, really. Always feel beat. Is this gonna take long? I got things to do.
DOCTOR: “Things to do,” of course. Very well. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: High blood pressure… maybe? The doctor back in the city used to fuss about somethin’ like that, years ago. But I don't take nothin’ for it. Didn’t see the point. Diabetes? No, never. Heart… well, it still beats, doesn’t it? I’ve never been a sickly man. Just… tired. Honestly, doctors always worryin’ about somethin’. I just want to know what’s makin’ my face look like a balloon.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… Let me see… Had my appendix out when I was a kid, I think. And… oh, and a few skin tags removed off my back a while back. Nothin’ major. That’s about it. Look, I’m tellin’ ya, I’m a simple man. I work hard, eat my dinner, and now my face is puffy. Is this gettin’ anywhere?
DOCTOR: We’re getting somewhere, Mr. Miner, though perhaps not as quickly as you’d like. Now, family history. Do you have any family members – parents, siblings – who have had heart problems, kidney problems, or swelling in their legs or face?
PATIENT: Family history? You kiddin’ me? My family came over from Sweden generations ago. I barely knew ‘em. My mother… she died young, somethin’ with her lungs, I think. And my father… worked on a boat, never saw him much. No, I don't know nothin’ about their health. They weren’t sittin’ around keepin’ track of that kinda thing, I can tell ya that much. They were workin’. Like I said, simple people. This is a waste of time. Honestly.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? Not that I know of. I don't take medications. Never have. Why would I? I just… tough it out. A little pain never hurt nobody. Look, are you gonna tell me what’s wrong with my face or what? I got a job to do, you know. This whole thing is a bit ridiculous. I’ve been perfectly fine for fifty-nine years, and now suddenly I need to know my family history? It’s absurd.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Miner. I think it’s time we do a quick physical exam. I need to listen to your heart and lungs, and I’ll take a look at your legs and face. Then we’ll talk about what might be going on. Please sit up on the examination table. And, with all due respect, this isn't about wasting your time, it’s about trying to understand what's happening with your body.
PATIENT: Fine. But don't expect much. It’s probably just… old age. I’m tellin’ ya. Just… get it over with.
DOCTOR: Alright, take a deep breath for me, please… and again… Now, I'm going to listen to your lungs. Deep breath… and again… Okay. Your heart sounds… slightly irregular. And I do hear some congestion in your lungs. Your ankles are significantly swollen. And the skin is… pitting edema. Your face also shows noticeable swelling, particularly around the eyes. Alright, Mr. Miner, based on what you’ve told me and what I’m seeing here, it’s likely we're dealing with fluid retention, possibly due to heart failure, though we need further testing to confirm. The congestion in your lungs and irregular heartbeat are concerning.
PATIENT: Heart failure? Now you're just tryin’ to scare me. I feel fine! A little tired, maybe. But heart failure? I weld things, Doctor, I don't have heart failure! It’s just… water weight. Probably from the heat. I work hard, okay? That's all. What kind of “further testing” are we talkin' about? And how much is this gonna cost me? I ain't insured, you know.
DOCTOR: Mr. Miner, I understand your concerns, and I assure you, I'm not trying to scare you. However, dismissing these symptoms as simply "water weight" could be dangerous. We need to rule out serious causes. The testing I recommend is a blood test to check your kidney function and electrolytes, and an EKG to assess your heart rhythm. We'll also need a chest X-ray to evaluate the congestion in your lungs. As for the cost, I'll have the billing department provide you with an estimate of the cash price for each test. It's important to address this now to prevent potential complications. Would you like me to have the billing department reach out to you with that information?
