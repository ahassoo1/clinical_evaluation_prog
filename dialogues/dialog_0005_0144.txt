DOCTOR: Alright, Mrs. Calvery, have a seat. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello, Doctor… Donate, is it? Yes, yes. Well, my daughter insisted. Said I should just… get checked out. Honestly, I feel perfectly fine. Just a little… curious, I suppose. She worries too much, that girl. Always has.
DOCTOR: Right. “Just curious.” Well, it’s always good to be proactive, even if you feel fine. Sometimes things are developing that you don’t notice. Still, let's start with what’s been going on, even if it’s not much. Any changes in your energy levels lately?
PATIENT: Changes? Hmm… well, I do nap more than I used to. But that’s because the afternoons are warm, dear. And the television is so… relaxing. I used to be able to garden all day, but these days… well, a little sit-down after lunch is nice. Is that what you mean? Honestly, I don't see what all the fuss is about.
DOCTOR: Okay, so more afternoon rest. And you used to be able to garden for longer periods. Anything else different?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think. My hands… they get a little stiff sometimes. Not painful, just… not as nimble as they used to be. Makes it hard to, well, to do the little embroidery I enjoy. Though honestly, I haven’t done much of that lately either. It’s just… things aren’t as easy as they were. Is that helpful? I’m terrible at remembering details, you know.
DOCTOR: Alright. Stiff hands, difficulty with embroidery. And when did you first notice this stiffness?
PATIENT: Oh, my goodness. When… let me see. It wasn’t sudden, that’s for sure. It’s been… creeping up on me, I suppose. Months, maybe? A year? Honestly, Doctor, time just… blurs. It feels like just yesterday my husband was still here, and that was… well, a long time ago now. I wouldn’t know the exact timing, I just know it’s not new.
DOCTOR: Okay. Months to a year of gradual hand stiffness. And is this stiffness worse at certain times of the day?
PATIENT: Oh, now, that’s a good question. Let me think… it’s usually worse in the mornings. First thing, you know? Everything feels a bit… creaky. Then it loosens up a little as I get going. Though honestly, getting going isn't what it used to be. Is that what you meant? It’s just… old age, I suppose. You know how it is.
DOCTOR: Alright, worse in the mornings. Any pain associated with the stiffness?
PATIENT: Pain? Not exactly pain. It’s more of an ache, a discomfort. Not sharp, you understand. Just… a general feeling of… well, everything being a little bit sore. It doesn’t keep me up at night or anything. Honestly, I've had worse aches from gardening, and I used to do a lot of gardening. I don’t think it’s worth making a fuss over, really.
DOCTOR: Okay. No sharp pain, just a general ache. Now, besides your hands, have you noticed any stiffness or discomfort in other joints?
PATIENT: Oh… now you mention it… my knees sometimes bother me, getting up from a chair. But that’s just… I’m a bit heavier than I used to be, isn’t it? It’s just the weight, I expect. Honestly, I wouldn't have even thought to mention it. It’s just… part of getting older. You know. Everything gets a bit… wobbly. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Alright, knees bothering you when getting up. And have you noticed any swelling in any of your joints – hands, knees, anywhere else?
PATIENT: Swelling… hmmm. Now, that’s a thought. I don’t think so. My ankles sometimes look a little puffy at the end of the day, but that’s just from being on my feet, isn’t it? Honestly, I wear sensible shoes. I don’t think it’s swelling, more like… fullness. Is that a thing? I wouldn't know what proper swelling looks like. I just know I don’t look like I’ve got balloons for hands and feet.
DOCTOR: Okay. No noticeable joint swelling. Now, let’s talk about your overall health. Do you have any medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Well, the doctor before… Dr. Hemlock, was it? He said my blood pressure was a little high, years ago. He put me on a little pill, but I stopped taking it. Honestly, it just made me feel tired. And my hips… I had a bit of trouble with them a long time ago, but I never needed surgery or anything. Honestly, I’ve always been a fairly healthy person. Just… getting old is taking its toll, I expect. Is that what you want to know? I can't recall specifics, you see. It was all so long ago.
DOCTOR: Alright. High blood pressure in the past, stopped medication due to fatigue. Hip trouble in the past. And are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter ones?
PATIENT: Oh, just the occasional ibuprofen for a headache. And a little vitamin D in the winter, because my daughter says I don't get enough sunshine. Honestly, that's all. I don't like taking pills, you see. They always make me feel… strange. I prefer to just tough things out, if I can. Is that alright? I’m not one for a lot of medication. It's just not my style.
DOCTOR: Alright. Ibuprofen as needed, vitamin D in winter. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmmm. Now that’s a tricky one. I don’t think so. I used to get a little itchy when I was a child around cats, but I haven’t been around a cat in years. Honestly, I can't recall anything serious. I've never had a bad reaction to anything, as far as I know. My daughter is always warning me about allergies, but I haven't had any issues. Is that helpful? It’s just… I don’t think I’m allergic to much of anything. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Alright. No known allergies. Now, let’s talk about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Well, my mother had… something with her heart, I think. She was very frail in her later years. And my brother… he had trouble with his joints, a lot of aches and pains. Honestly, I don't recall the specifics. It was so long ago, and we didn't talk about these things much back then. It's just… old age, I suppose. It runs in the family. Is that what you mean? It’s difficult to remember details, you see. It was a long time ago now.
DOCTOR: Alright. History of heart issues and joint problems in the family. Now, can you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Well, I try to stay busy. I enjoy watching television, of course. And I like to keep up with my friends, though we don’t get together as much as we used to. Honestly, I don't do much strenuous activity these days. It's just… getting old, you see. I take things easy. Is that what you mean? I try to be comfortable. That's the most important thing.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s do a quick physical exam, just to get a better picture of things. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Oh… well. I suppose so. I’m not one for poking and prodding, but if you think it’s necessary. Honestly, I’m a bit worried about falling. I’m not as steady on my feet as I used to be. Just… take it easy, alright? And don't be too rough. Is that alright? I bruise easily, you know.
DOCTOR: Of course. We'll take it very slow and gentle. If you feel unsteady at any point, just let me know. First, let's check your blood pressure and pulse. Could you please roll up your sleeve?
PATIENT: Oh, alright dear. Honestly, I always get nervous when the doctor takes my blood pressure. It always seems to be a little high when I’m at the doctor’s office. Is that normal? I don't know why that is. Perhaps it's just the anticipation. It makes my heart flutter, you know.
DOCTOR: It’s quite common for blood pressure to be slightly elevated in a clinical setting – what we call “white coat hypertension”. Let’s just see what it is today. 148 over 82. A little high, as you suspected. Pulse is 78, regular. Now, let's listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath in… and out… again…
PATIENT: Honestly, my lungs have always been a bit… wheezy. I never smoked, but my mother did, and I think it might have affected me. Is that possible? It’s just a little rattle sometimes, nothing serious. I've never had any trouble breathing, as far as I know. It's just… a little noise. Is that what you’re hearing? Is it bad? I get worried easily, you know.
DOCTOR: I do hear some mild wheezing, as you mentioned. It's not alarming, but it's something to keep an eye on. Now, let's check your joints. Can you bend your fingers for me?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s a little stiff. See? That’s what I was telling you about. It’s not painful, just… not as smooth as it used to be. Especially in the mornings. It takes a little while to loosen up. Honestly, I used to be able to knit for hours without any trouble. Now… it’s just a little difficult. Is that what you want to see? Is it bad? I get worried easily, you know. It feels like something's stuck.
DOCTOR: I notice some mild tenderness and decreased range of motion in your knuckles. No visible swelling at this time. Now, let’s check your knees. Can you bend them for me?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s a little uncomfortable. See? That’s what I was telling you. It’s not sharp pain, just… a dull ache. Especially when I get up from a chair. Honestly, I used to be able to garden all day without any trouble. Now… it takes a little while to get going. And I have to be careful not to fall. Is that what you want to see? Is it bad? I worry about my balance, you know. It’s not what it used to be.
DOCTOR: There’s some mild tenderness to palpation on both knees. No significant swelling. Okay, let’s check your reflexes. Please relax your legs. Reflexes are a little diminished, but within normal limits for your age. Now, one more thing. Let's stand up slowly. How is your balance?
PATIENT: Oh, a little wobbly. See? That’s what I was telling you. It’s not a sudden fall risk, just… a little unsteady. It’s better after I’ve been walking for a few minutes, but it takes a little while to get going. Honestly, I used to be able to walk for miles without any trouble. Now… I have to take it slow. Is that what you want to see? I don't want to make a fuss, but I worry about falling, you know. It's just… a little bit frightening.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mrs. Calvery. Thank you. That was helpful. Based on what you've told me and the physical exam, it sounds like you're experiencing some age-related changes – likely osteoarthritis in your hands and knees, and some mild balance issues. The wheezing is something we’ll want to keep an eye on as well. Now, I'd like to order some blood work, including a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a rheumatoid factor test to rule out any inflammatory conditions. I’d also like to get an X-ray of your hands and knees to assess the extent of the arthritis. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Oh… blood work and X-rays? Honestly, that sounds like a lot. I don't like needles, you know. And I worry about radiation. Is it safe? And what if something is wrong? I don't want to know if I'm… sick, you know? I just wanted to get checked out, not… diagnosed with something. Honestly, I’m a bit overwhelmed. Is all of that really necessary? Perhaps just a little something for my balance would be enough? I don't want to make a fuss, but I do get anxious about these things.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mrs. Calvery. The blood work and X-rays are primarily to get a clearer picture of what’s going on, and to rule out any other potential causes for your symptoms. The blood work is a simple procedure, and the radiation from the X-rays is minimal – it's less than what you're exposed to on a cross-country flight. We’re taking precautions to minimize your exposure. As for your balance, we can certainly discuss options for that, but it's important to understand why your balance is affected before we start any treatment. Knowing the underlying cause will help us choose the most effective course of action. We can start with the blood work and X-rays, and then we can discuss the results and formulate a plan. If you’re really uncomfortable, we can postpone the X-rays for now, but I do recommend them for a more accurate diagnosis. What do you think?
PATIENT: Oh… well. If you really think it’s necessary, I suppose I can do the blood work. But I don't want to know the results right away, you understand? I don't want to worry myself sick. And I’m still hesitant about the X-rays. Perhaps we can talk about it later? After I’ve had a chance to think about it? Honestly, I get anxious about these things. And I don't want to make a fuss. But what about something for my balance right away? Perhaps a little physical therapy or something? I'm just worried about falling, you know. It's just… a little frightening.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mrs. Calvery. We can certainly start with the blood work and hold off on the X-rays for now. We can discuss them again after we have the blood results. As for your balance, I agree that physical therapy would be a good starting point. I’m going to write you a referral to a physical therapist who specializes in geriatric care. They can assess your balance, strength, and gait, and develop a personalized exercise program to improve your stability and reduce your risk of falls. They'll also give you some strategies to prevent falls at home. Does that sound like a good plan?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, that sounds lovely, dear. Physical therapy. That sounds much better than needles and X-rays. A nice young person to help me with my balance. That sounds just right. And you’ll give me the referral? And you’ll tell me what the blood work is for, so I don’t worry too much? Honestly, I appreciate you being so patient with me. I’m just… a bit of a worrier, you know. Is that alright? Can I ask one more question? What about my hands? Can anything be done for the stiffness? It’s just… painful sometimes.
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely. I’ll write you a referral to a physical therapist specializing in geriatric care and will include information about your balance concerns and hand stiffness. We'll discuss the blood work again later. For your hands, the physical therapist can teach you some exercises to improve your range of motion and strengthen your hand muscles. They may also recommend some assistive devices, like splints or compression gloves, to reduce pain and swelling. Over-the-counter pain relievers, like ibuprofen, can also help manage your discomfort. In some cases, corticosteroid injections can provide temporary relief, but we'll discuss that with the physical therapist if necessary. It’s important to stay active and avoid activities that aggravate your symptoms. Does that sound like a reasonable approach?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. That sounds lovely. Exercises and splints… and maybe a little ibuprofen. That sounds much better than needles and X-rays. And you’ll write everything down for me? So I don’t forget? Honestly, my memory isn’t what it used to be. And you’ll tell me what to expect at the physical therapy appointment? I get anxious about meeting new people. Is that alright? I just want to be prepared. Thank you, dear. You’ve been very kind. I think that’s all my questions for now.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mrs. Calvery. I’m happy to help. I'm writing down the referral to the physical therapist, the instructions for the blood work, and a note about over-the-counter pain relief. I'll also include a brief explanation of what to expect at your physical therapy appointment. They will assess your condition, develop a personalized exercise program, and teach you some strategies to manage your symptoms. They'll also answer any questions you have. Here you go. Please call the physical therapy office to schedule an appointment at your convenience. If you have any questions or concerns, don't hesitate to call my office. We're here to help. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: Oh, thank you, dear. That’s very kind. Yes, I think that’s all. I appreciate your patience with me. Honestly, I do worry about things. But you’ve put my mind at ease. I’ll call the physical therapy office and schedule an appointment right away. Thank you again, dear. You’ve been very helpful. Goodbye.
