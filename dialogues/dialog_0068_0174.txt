DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Derasmo. I'm Dr. Sham. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, to be frank, I haven’t been…myself, lately. It’s a bit difficult to explain, truthfully. I just feel…down. And tired. Very tired. I suppose that’s a start. I’d like to get this sorted, if possible. I haven’t got all day, you understand.
DOCTOR: Okay, “feeling down and tired.” I understand. And how long has this been going on?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… It’s been… several months now, I’d say. At least six. Maybe longer. It’s hard to pinpoint exactly when it started, you know? It wasn’t a sudden thing. Just…gradual. It's been interfering with things, and I don't like that.
DOCTOR: Several months... gradual onset. Interfering with things. Can you tell me a little more about what's being interfered with?
PATIENT: Well, my work, for one. I'm a lifeguard, you see. And ski patrol in the winter. Keeps me active, usually. But I’ve been…less enthusiastic. Calling in sick more often. I just don’t have the energy, or the…drive, to do it like I used to. And even things at home… I used to enjoy gardening, but now… it just feels like a chore. My daughter keeps calling to check on me, too. She's worried. It's… upsetting, really.
DOCTOR: Alright. Less energy, decreased enthusiasm for work and hobbies, and concern from your daughter. Have you noticed any changes in your sleep?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. My sleep is… fitful, at best. I used to sleep like a log. Now, I wake up several times a night. Sometimes I can’t get back to sleep at all. And when I do sleep, I don’t feel rested when I wake up. It’s… frustrating. I've tried warm milk, and those herbal teas… nothing seems to really help. It’s been like this for a while now, too. Not just recently.
DOCTOR: Trouble sleeping, waking frequently, not feeling rested. Okay. And have you noticed any changes in your appetite?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. I… I haven’t been eating as much as I used to, no. Not because I’m trying to, but… food just doesn’t appeal to me like it once did. I used to love cooking, Nigerian food especially, you know? But now… it feels like an effort. I mostly just pick at things. My daughter brought over some stew the other day, and I barely touched it. She was quite concerned, naturally. It's all rather… discouraging.
DOCTOR: Decreased appetite, loss of interest in enjoyable foods. Okay. Have you been experiencing any difficulty with your concentration, or perhaps feeling more irritable than usual?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, definitely. I find it hard to focus on anything these days. Reading, which I used to enjoy immensely, is a struggle. My mind just wanders. And… yes, I suppose I’ve been a bit more… short-tempered than usual. I snap at people for no reason, then feel terrible about it afterwards. It’s… not like me, you know? I used to be very patient. This is all very unlike me, honestly. It's making me quite anxious.
DOCTOR: Difficulty concentrating, irritability... anxiety. Alright. And have you noticed any physical symptoms – perhaps any unexplained aches, pains, or weight loss?
PATIENT: Hmm… well, I have been feeling a bit more… achy, I suppose. My joints, mostly. I put it down to getting older, truthfully. But it's more persistent than usual. And yes, I think I have lost a bit of weight. Not a significant amount, but my clothes are a little looser than they used to be. I haven't been weighing myself regularly, but I would say… a few kilograms, perhaps? It's just… everything feels off, you know? I just want to feel normal again. It's exhausting constantly feeling… this way.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Derasmo. Several months of feeling down and tired, trouble sleeping, decreased appetite, difficulty concentrating, irritability, and some joint aches and weight loss. Before we proceed, are you currently taking any medications, or do you have any allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I'm not taking any regular medications. Never have been, truthfully. Just the occasional pain reliever for a headache, if needed. And no allergies, not that I’m aware of. I’ve always been quite healthy, normally. This is all very… new to me. I hope it isn't anything serious. I really just want to feel like myself again, if that makes any sense. It's interfering with everything, and frankly, I haven't got time for this.
DOCTOR: Okay. No medications, no known allergies. Alright. Now, have you had any significant illnesses or surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Let me think… Nothing major, no. I had my appendix out when I was a young woman, many years ago. And I broke my arm once, skiing, ironically enough. But that was decades ago, and I recovered fully. Nothing else comes to mind. I’ve always been fairly robust, normally. Just the usual colds and flu, nothing serious. I’m not one for spending time in hospitals, if I can avoid it. I’ve always been a very active person, and I’d like to keep it that way.
DOCTOR: Okay, appendectomy in the past, a broken arm. No other significant medical history. And finally, is there any family history of depression, anxiety, or other mental health conditions?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a difficult question. My mother… she was always a bit… melancholic, I suppose. Quiet, withdrawn. She never really spoke about her feelings. And my aunt… she was hospitalized for a while when she was younger, though I don’t know the specifics. It was never really discussed openly. So, perhaps… a bit of a history, yes. But nothing definitive, truthfully. It wasn't something we talked about much in my family. It was considered a… private matter, you see.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Derasmo. Thank you for that information. Based on what you've told me, and considering your symptoms, we need to rule out a few things. It sounds like you may be experiencing symptoms of depression, but it's important to ensure there isn't an underlying physical cause. We'll start with a physical exam, and then I’d like to order some blood work. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds… sensible. Anything that will help me get back to normal, truthfully. A physical exam and blood work… yes, that’s fine. Just… please don’t keep me waiting too long. I have things to do, you understand. I appreciate you taking the time to listen, truthfully. I just want to feel like myself again. Is there anything I need to do to prepare for these tests?
DOCTOR: No preparation needed for the exam, just relax. The blood work will require you to fast for eight hours beforehand – no food or drinks other than water. We'll get that scheduled now. Let's start with the exam. Could you please step onto the scale for me?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Eight hours fasting… I suppose I can manage that. It’s… inconvenient, but I’ll do what I need to. There you are. Let’s get this over with, shall we? I haven't got all day, you understand.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Derasmo, your weight is 78 kilograms. And your height is 180 centimeters. That gives you a BMI of 25.6, which is in the overweight range. Now, let’s check your blood pressure. Could you please extend your arm?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Alright, there you go. Overweight, you say? Well, I've always been a solid woman, truthfully. I'm more concerned about feeling constantly tired and…down. But yes, go ahead. The sooner this is done, the better. I have things to do, you understand. Just let me know if you need anything.
DOCTOR: Alright, your blood pressure is 142/90. That's slightly elevated. Now, let’s listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath for me… and again… Okay, your heart sounds regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear, but a bit of diminished breath sounds bilaterally. Could you please open your mouth for me?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. There you go. Elevated blood pressure, you say? Well, I've been a bit stressed lately, truthfully. I’m not surprised. Diminished breath sounds… is that something to worry about? I haven't been coughing or anything, truthfully. Just… tired. Please hurry, Doctor. I really haven’t got all day, you understand. And frankly, this is rather…uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Throat looks clear, no redness. Your thyroid feels normal, no enlargement. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes. Please relax your legs. Reflexes are normal. Finally, I’m going to briefly assess your range of motion in your joints. Can you raise both arms above your head?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. There you go. A bit stiff, truthfully. My joints haven’t been the same lately. I’m not surprised they’re a bit stiff, truthfully. I've been less active, you understand. Is something wrong, Doctor? I really haven’t got all day, you understand. And frankly, this is getting rather tiresome. Just tell me what you think.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Derasmo. Your range of motion is slightly limited in both shoulders, with some discomfort. Overall, the physical exam doesn’t reveal anything acutely concerning, but your slightly elevated blood pressure, diminished breath sounds, and joint discomfort warrant further investigation. Based on your symptoms and the exam, I suspect you may be experiencing a combination of factors – possibly a mood disorder like depression, coupled with some underlying physical issues that need to be addressed. I’m ordering a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, a thyroid stimulating hormone test, and a vitamin D level. We’ll also want to rule out any inflammatory conditions, so I'm ordering an erythrocyte sedimentation rate and a C-reactive protein. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds… thorough. Complete blood count, metabolic panel, thyroid, vitamin D, inflammatory markers… yes, that’s fine. Anything that will help me get to the bottom of this. Honestly, I just want to feel normal again. The sooner we have the results, the better. Just… please let me know as soon as they’re available. I really haven’t got all day, you understand. Can I go now? I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Derasmo. I’ve ordered the blood work. The lab results typically take 2-3 business days. My office will call you as soon as they're available to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, I recommend trying to maintain a regular sleep schedule, even on weekends. Avoid caffeine and alcohol, especially before bedtime. And if you’re feeling overwhelmed, please don’t hesitate to reach out to a family member or friend for support. If you find yourself having thoughts of harming yourself, please go to the nearest emergency room or call 911. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don't think so. Regular sleep schedule, no caffeine, reach out for support… yes, I understand. Honestly, I just want to feel like myself again. And I haven’t got time for all this, truthfully. Thank you for your time. I’ll be going now. Please do call as soon as you have the results. Thank you.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Derasmo. We'll be in touch. Have a good day.
