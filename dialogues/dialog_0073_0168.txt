DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Pandolfi. I'm Dr. Korrell. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s…well, it’s a delicate situation, really. I’m dating someone, and I just want to be certain everything is as it should be, you understand. A woman of my…experience…needs to be thorough.
DOCTOR: I understand. You’re wanting a general check-up, ensuring everything is healthy, particularly given a new relationship. Is that correct?
PATIENT: Precisely. And not just healthy, Doctor. Competent. I’ve…encountered certain disappointments in the past. One simply doesn’t want unpleasant surprises cropping up now, does one? It’s about peace of mind, truly. And discretion, of course.
DOCTOR: Certainly. Discretion is paramount, Ms. Pandolfi. Let's start with a comprehensive history. Perhaps we can begin with any current symptoms you may be experiencing?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Oh, goodness, no. Nothing…noticeable. I assure you, I maintain myself. It’s more about preventative measures, Doctor. Making certain there aren’t…latent issues, shall we say? Things one might not even feel until it’s far too late. Though, now that you mention it, I have been a bit more… fatigued lately. But I attribute that to the social engagements, honestly. One does tire of making conversation.
DOCTOR: Alright. Fatigue is good to note. Can you describe the fatigue a bit more?
PATIENT: Well, it's not…debilitating, Doctor. It’s simply that after a dinner party, or a charity luncheon, I find myself needing a rather substantial nap. And then, perhaps another short rest later in the afternoon. It’s not like I’m unable to fulfill my obligations, mind you. I still manage my…commitments. It’s just…it wasn't always this way. I used to have such energy. Though, one does get older, doesn’t one? It’s simply…less convenient now.
DOCTOR: I understand. And how long has this increased fatigue been occurring?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see…it’s been…well, it started sometime after the spring gala, I believe. Perhaps three months ago? Yes, definitely after the gala. That was such a lovely event, though rather crowded. One feels quite drained after being in such close proximity to so many…people. It’s a taxing experience, really. The small talk, the polite smiles…it exhausts me simply recounting it.
DOCTOR: Alright. And aside from the fatigue, are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think…well, my digestion hasn't been quite as reliable as it once was. A bit of…discomfort, you understand. Nothing alarming, just…a lack of regularity. And I've noticed a slight…sensitivity to light. But truthfully, Doctor, I spend a good deal of time indoors, so it could simply be the lighting in my home. I do have a rather…dramatic aesthetic, you see. Everything is quite…moody.
DOCTOR: Okay. Digestive discomfort and possible photosensitivity. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: Oh, my appetite is perfectly normal, Doctor. I do enjoy a good meal, and I maintain a very…balanced diet. And my weight…well, it fluctuates a bit, as it does with all women, doesn't it? I wouldn’t say it’s anything significant. Perhaps a pound or two, but nothing that concerns me. I assure you, I watch my figure. It's important to make a good impression, you understand. Especially in my…social circles.
DOCTOR: Alright. Do you have any past medical history?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. I had a rather unpleasant bout of pneumonia when I was younger, perhaps thirty years ago. And I’ve always been prone to migraines, though they are well-controlled now with…certain remedies. Nothing serious, truly. And I had my gallbladder removed some years ago, but it caused me no lasting trouble. Other than that, I've always been quite robust, if I do say so myself. I attribute it to good genes, and a very…disciplined lifestyle. Though, I do occasionally indulge in a glass of champagne. It’s simply…necessary, you understand.
DOCTOR: Okay. And have you had any surgeries besides your gallbladder removal?
PATIENT: Let me think... Oh! Yes. I had a minor procedure on my knee, years ago. A sports injury, from skiing. Though it wasn't particularly serious. And I had some…cosmetic work done, a very long time ago. A little lift here and there. Nothing dramatic, you understand. Just…maintaining appearances. One has certain standards, you see. It’s important to project an image of…vitality. Though, truthfully, it was more for my husband. He appreciates a well-groomed wife.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about family history?
PATIENT: Oh, that's a rather…complicated matter, Doctor. My mother suffered from…nervousness, shall we say? She was a very delicate woman. And my father had high blood pressure, though he lived to a respectable age. My grandmother had…arthritis, and my aunt…well, my aunt had a rather unfortunate incident with…alcohol. But truthfully, Doctor, we weren't a very close family. I prefer not to dwell on it. It’s best to focus on the present, don’t you think? And on maintaining a…pleasant disposition.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your social history?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s a rather…extensive topic, Doctor. I am, as you know, married. My husband is a…successful businessman. We have a very…active social life, as I mentioned. Numerous luncheons, dinner parties, charity events. I am also involved in several…philanthropic organizations. And I enjoy…cultural pursuits, such as the opera and the theater. Honestly, I keep quite busy. One must maintain a certain…presence, you see. It's simply expected. Though, lately, I've been focusing more on…personal relationships. Which is what brings me here, of course. A woman of my…discretion…needs to be thorough.
DOCTOR: Alright. Do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no. I am perfectly robust, as I’ve said. Though, I do have a slight…sensitivity to penicillin. A minor rash, years ago. Nothing alarming. As for medications, I take a small dose of estrogen, to…maintain my vitality. And I occasionally take a mild sleeping aid, if I’m particularly…stressed. But truthfully, Doctor, I prefer natural remedies whenever possible. A glass of warm milk, a quiet evening…those are far more effective. And less…troublesome, you understand.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’d like to conduct a brief physical exam now, if that’s alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, certainly, Doctor. Though, please be gentle. I bruise rather easily, you see. And I do have sensitive skin. A woman of my…refinement…takes pride in her appearance, you understand. But do proceed. I trust your…expertise. And please, do let me know if you require any…details. I am quite thorough myself, you see. A good chart is simply invaluable, wouldn’t you agree?
DOCTOR: Certainly. I will be as gentle as possible. Let’s start with your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is a bit elevated at 145 over 90. Heart sounds are regular, but slightly rapid. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Abdomen is soft, non-tender. No masses palpable. Reflexes are 2+ and equal bilaterally. Skin is fair with some age spots. No rashes or lesions noted. Okay. Everything seems within normal limits, but we'll need to discuss your elevated blood pressure.
PATIENT: Oh dear. Elevated, you say? That is… concerning. Though, truthfully, Doctor, I have been rather…flustered lately. All the social engagements, and now…this new relationship. It’s simply…a lot to manage, you see. One’s nerves are quite frayed. Is it something serious? Will I need…medication? I do try to avoid pharmaceuticals whenever possible, as I mentioned. And I simply must maintain my…appearance. It’s crucial, you understand. Especially when one is…meeting new people.
DOCTOR: It's good that you recognize the potential stress. Elevated blood pressure, if left untreated, can lead to serious complications like heart disease and stroke. We need to investigate this further. First, I’d like to order some basic blood work – a complete blood count, a chemistry panel, and a thyroid test. That will give us a better understanding of your overall health. Also, I think it would be prudent to monitor your blood pressure at home for a week. I can provide you with a device, and instructions on how to use it. Finally, I recommend discussing stress management techniques. Have you considered meditation, yoga, or even just regular exercise?
PATIENT: Oh my. Blood work, you say? How…intrusive. Though, I suppose it’s necessary, if you deem it so, Doctor. Very well. Proceed. And the device…will it be…discreet? I simply wouldn't want to cause a stir. One has a certain reputation to maintain, you understand. As for stress management…well, I suppose I could attempt meditation. Though I find it rather…difficult to quiet my mind. So many engagements to plan, so many people to see. It’s simply…exhausting. Yoga…well, I’m afraid my flexibility isn’t what it once was. Perhaps a nice, relaxing massage? That would be far more…beneficial, I assure you. And less…taxing. And please, Doctor, do let me know the results promptly. I’m quite anxious, you see. Especially with…everything happening.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I will expedite the blood work order, and we can discuss the results as soon as they are available. I'll have the nurse provide you with a home blood pressure monitor and instructions. And while I understand your concerns, I do recommend at least considering some stress-reducing activities. Even a short walk each day can make a difference. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don’t believe so. Though…perhaps you could recommend a good massage therapist? Someone…discreet, of course. And preferably with experience handling…refined clientele. And please, do ensure they use high-quality oils. One simply cannot skimp on quality, you understand. As for the rest…I trust your expertise. Just…do keep me informed. I’m rather…dependent on my peace of mind, you see. And this new relationship…well, it’s simply…crucial that everything be…perfect. It’s a delicate situation, you understand. Very delicate.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I’ll have the nurse provide you with a list of reputable massage therapists in the area. Alright. We'll get the blood work scheduled, and I’ll have the nurse go over everything with you. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. And remember, maintaining open communication is key. I think that covers everything for today. Thank you for coming in.
PATIENT: .
