DOCTOR: Hi Brad, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Morenomartinez. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, doc, it’s… unpleasant. Been coughin’ up blood, mostly. Not a lot, but enough to worry a fella. Started a few days back, figured it was just a bad cold, but it ain't gettin' better. And honestly, I don't have time for this. I got things to do.
DOCTOR: Okay, coughing up blood is definitely something we need to figure out. A few days, you said?
PATIENT: Yeah, three, maybe four days now. It’s…darker red, not bright, if that makes a difference. And it's not with every cough, just some of 'em. Look, I ain't a doctor, I just know it ain't right. I've never had anything like this before. I used to be a strong man, worked hard my whole life, and now this…weakness. It’s frustrating.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Brad. It’s good you’re getting it checked out. Darker red blood can sometimes tell us a bit more, so that's helpful. And it’s important that you're noticing it's not with every cough. Let's get some more details. Have you had any fever, chills, or night sweats along with the cough?
PATIENT: Fever? No, not really. Maybe a little warm sometimes, but nothin’ a good sleep wouldn’t fix. Chills, no. And night sweats…well, I live alone now, lost my wife a few years back, so I don’t really notice things like that anymore. Honestly, doc, I'm not one for complainin'. I just want to know what’s wrong and how to fix it. Is it serious? Because I really can’t afford to be laid up.
DOCTOR: Okay, I hear you. No fever or chills is good. We'll definitely work to figure out what's going on and get you back on your feet. You mentioned losing your wife a few years ago – I'm very sorry to hear that. It’s okay to not notice things when you're going through a tough time. Now, besides the blood in your cough, have you had any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms…hmm. I’ve been a bit tired, I suppose. More tired than usual, but I’ve been workin' long hours at the crematory. It’s…a demanding job. And my stomach’s been a little off, too. Not diarrhea or nothin', just… unsettled. Like I ate somethin’ bad. And I’ve lost a little weight, probably. My clothes feel a bit looser, but I haven’t been weighin' myself. Not much time for vanity these days.
DOCTOR: Okay, tiredness, stomach upset, and some weight loss... that’s helpful information, Brad. You work at a crematory, you said?
PATIENT: Yeah, been doin' that for…oh, close to fifteen years now. It’s…not a glamorous job, but it pays the bills. Lots of fumes, though. I try to wear a mask, but it ain’t always enough. And the dust…always the dust. I don't know if that's got somethin' to do with it. Look, I ain’t a doctor, I’m just tellin’ you what it's like. I always figured I was tough enough to handle it, but this cough…this is different. I just want to get back to work.
DOCTOR: Okay, fifteen years at the crematory, exposure to fumes and dust… that’s definitely something we need to consider. We’ll want to rule out anything related to that. Let’s move on to your medical history. Do you have any existing health conditions – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, heart problems, or anything else you've been diagnosed with?
PATIENT: Nah, nothin' like that. Always been healthy, really. A little arthritis in my knees, but that’s just from years of hard work. Never been one for doctors, honestly. Only go when somethin’ really bad happens. My wife…she was the one who kept up with all that. Blood pressure checks and whatnot. Now…well, I just try to ignore things and keep movin'.
DOCTOR: Okay, no pre-existing conditions, just some arthritis in your knees. And you're right to mention your wife – it’s alright to rely on others for those things. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Nope. Never needed nothin' like that. Broke my arm when I was a kid, fallin' out of a tree, but that's about it. Just a cast and a few weeks of bein' bored. I’m a practical man, doc. I try to avoid trouble. I fix things myself, don’t go runnin’ to the hospital unless it's absolutely necessary.
DOCTOR: Okay, no surgeries or hospitalizations. That's good to know. Now, I'm going to ask about your family history, if you don't mind. Do you know if anyone in your family – parents, siblings, grandparents – has had any serious health problems, like lung disease, cancer, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Lung disease…my father smoked for years, always coughin' and wheezin', but he died of a heart attack, not lung problems. My mother…she had high blood pressure, I think. That’s about all I remember. We weren’t a close family, always kept to ourselves. Didn't really talk about health problems. Didn't see much of 'em.
DOCTOR: Okay, your father with a history of smoking and your mother with high blood pressure. I understand you weren't a close family, so it's alright if you don't have a lot of details. Now, a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you currently smoke, or have you smoked in the past?
PATIENT: Never touched a cigarette in my life. Always thought it was a foolish habit. My father smoked, and I saw what it did to him, so I stayed far away from it. I do enjoy a good strong coffee, though. And a bit of sweet tea with dinner. But that’s about it.
DOCTOR: Okay, no history of smoking. Good. Do you drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Not really. A beer with the boys every now and then, maybe around a holiday or somethin', but I ain't a drinker. Never had much of a taste for it. It just…doesn’t appeal to me. I prefer to stay sharp, keep my wits about me.
DOCTOR: Okay, occasional beer, nothing regular. And do you use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Recreational drugs? Doc, are you serious? I work at a crematory, I deal with…well, you can imagine. I certainly don’t need anything extra to mess with my head. Never touched 'em, never will. I'm a practical man, remember?
DOCTOR: Of course, sir, I apologize. Just standard questions. Alright, lastly, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Nah, not that I know of. Never had a problem with anythin'. My wife used to keep track of all that stuff, but... well, like I said. I just take a little ibuprofen now and then for my knees, but that's about it. I'm a pretty simple man, doc.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies, just occasional ibuprofen. Thank you, Brad, that gives me a good picture of your overall health. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your throat. It won’t take long.
PATIENT: Fine. Get it over with. I got things to do, remember? Just…try to be quick about it.
DOCTOR: Okay, sir. If you could just sit here on the table, and I'll start by listening to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath in... and out... Okay, your blood pressure is a little elevated – 140 over 90. Your heart sounds normal, but I can hear some mild wheezing in your lungs, particularly on the left side. Your throat looks a little irritated, but no sign of any obvious infection. I'm also noticing you have a slightly fast pulse. Do you often feel your heart racing?
PATIENT: Racing? No. Not usually. Maybe a little jittery sometimes, after a strong cup of coffee. But not racin', exactly. Like I said, I’m a practical man. I notice things, and I know somethin’ ain’t right with this cough. That wheezin’…is that bad? And what about my stomach? You didn’t say nothin’ about my stomach.
DOCTOR: The wheezing could be related to a number of things, Brad – could be irritation in your airways, or even a bit of inflammation. We'll need to investigate further. And you’re right to bring up your stomach – I did overlook that. When you say unsettled, can you describe the pain?
PATIENT: It's not exactly pain, doc. More of a…discomfort. Sort of a dull ache, low down. Comes and goes. Sometimes after I eat, sometimes not. Feels like somethin's…off. Like somethin' ain't sittin' right. I just figured it was somethin' I ate. I'm not one for fussin' over little things. But it's been goin' on for a few days now, which is why I came in.
DOCTOR: Okay, a dull ache, low down, comes and goes, sometimes after eating. It's good you're paying attention to it. Given the cough, the wheezing, the stomach discomfort, and some weight loss, I think we should get some tests done to rule out a few possibilities. Would you be comfortable with a chest X-ray and some blood work?
PATIENT: Tests…fine. Get it over with. I got a business to run, you know. But…what are you lookin’ for? What possibilities? Don't tell me it’s somethin' serious, doc. I ain’t got time for serious.
DOCTOR: We want to rule out a few things, Brad. The chest X-ray will help us look at your lungs to see if there's any sign of infection, inflammation, or anything else going on. The blood work will give us information about your overall health and help us identify any potential problems. I'm not going to jump to conclusions, but we need to rule out things like pneumonia, bronchitis, or even a possible lung mass. And given your stomach discomfort, we'll also check your blood count to make sure everything is okay there. It's likely nothing serious, but it's important to be thorough. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Lung mass…? Look, doc, I ain't scared easy, but that sounds awful. I’ve been workin' at that crematory for fifteen years, breathin' in all sorts of fumes and dust. Is that…is that what this is about? I told you, I ain't got time for this.
DOCTOR: Brad, it's good you’re voicing your concerns. The exposure to fumes and dust at the crematory is something we need to consider. It can increase your risk of lung problems, which is why we want to be thorough. But, and I want to emphasize this, we're not jumping to any conclusions. A lung mass is just one possibility, and it's not the most likely one. The tests will give us more information, and we’ll go from there. We’ll start with the X-ray and blood work. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood and get you scheduled for the X-ray. In the meantime, I'm going to write you a prescription for an inhaler. It should help with the wheezing and make it easier to breathe. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Inhaler…fine. Anything to make it easier to breathe. But I still think this is a waste of time. I’m a practical man, doc, and I don’t like bein’ poked and prodded. But…alright. Do what you gotta do. Just…get it over with. And try not to keep me here too long.
DOCTOR: Alright, Brad. I understand your frustration. I’ll write the prescription now, and the nurse will be in shortly. Once the tests are complete, we’ll review the results together and discuss the best course of action. I promise to keep things as efficient as possible. Do you have any questions for me before the nurse arrives?
PATIENT: No. Just…get it over with. And don’t tell me nothin' I don't need to know. I ain’t one for fussin'.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’ll let you get some rest while we wait for the nurse. .
