DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Bahta. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Alanes. It's nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is a pleasure to meet you as well. I am here, if I understand correctly, to see if my… situation qualifies for assistance at home. Or, perhaps, hospice care, if needed. My ex-wife arranged this visit, she handles most of these things now. It is for certification, she explained.
DOCTOR: Thank you for clarifying, Mr. Bahta. It sounds like we're discussing potential eligibility for home healthcare services, potentially including hospice, and completing the necessary certification. Your ex-wife is being very proactive, which is good. To get a better understanding of your situation, could you tell me a bit more about why you feel you might need assistance at home?
PATIENT: Yes, that is correct. Proactive is a good word, she always was very organized. Well, I… I had a surgery, some time ago now. It was on my… my abdomen. It did not go as planned, and I have had complications since. It makes it… difficult to manage things on my own. Simple things, mostly. Cooking, cleaning, getting dressed. And the pain, naturally, is… present. It is becoming harder to ignore.
DOCTOR: I understand. So, you had abdominal surgery with subsequent complications that are making it difficult to perform activities of daily living, and you're experiencing increasing pain. Could you tell me approximately when you had the surgery?
PATIENT: Let me see… It was… April of 2024. Yes, April the 15th, if I recall correctly. It was a Tuesday. My ex-wife drove me, and we had lunch at that little bistro near the hospital afterward. A very… unremarkable lunch, actually. But I remember the date precisely.
DOCTOR: Thank you for that detail, Mr. Bahta. That’s very helpful. I see here that you had an exploratory laparotomy on April 15th, 2024, at St. Luke’s Hospital. The operative report notes some adhesion formation and post-operative ileus. Now, can you describe the pain you're experiencing?
PATIENT: Yes, that is correct. St. Luke’s, yes. The pain… it is difficult to describe precisely. It is not a sharp pain, usually. More of a… constant ache, in my lower abdomen. It comes and goes, but it is always there, to some degree. Sometimes it feels like… pressure. Like something is… tight. And sometimes, if I move a certain way, or if I eat something… it becomes much worse. It radiates to my back as well, occasionally. It keeps me from sleeping, mostly.
DOCTOR: A constant ache with periods of increased pain, radiating to your back, and impacting your sleep. That sounds very challenging, Mr. Bahta. On a scale of zero to ten, with zero being no pain and ten being the worst pain imaginable, what would you rate your pain typically?
PATIENT: Typically… hmm. It is rarely a ten, thankfully. But it is not low, either. I would say… a six, on most days. Perhaps a five if I am being careful. But after… exertion, or if I have not taken my medication, it can easily go to a seven or eight. It is quite debilitating, I assure you. I avoid many things now, simply to avoid the pain.
DOCTOR: A typical pain level of six, increasing with activity and without medication, reaching seven or eight. And you’re modifying your activities to avoid exacerbating it. Now, let’s talk about those medications. What medications are you currently taking, and what dosages do you take?
PATIENT: Ah, the medications. My ex-wife handles all of that, you see. She keeps a list, I believe. I… I take something for the pain, a white pill, I think. And something for… my stomach, a small blue one. And sometimes, a yellow one if I am… particularly anxious. I truly do not know the names, Doctor. She fills the pill organizer every week. I can tell you what time I take them, if that is helpful. But the names… they escape me.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Bahta. Knowing the times is helpful, and we can certainly verify the names later. Could you tell me what time do you typically take each of these pills – the white, the blue, and the yellow ones?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. The white one, that is for the pain… I take that at eight in the morning, and again at eight in the evening. The blue one, for my stomach, is at nine in the morning, and four in the afternoon. And the yellow one… only when I am feeling particularly… unsettled. It varies. Perhaps once a week, sometimes less. I cannot give a precise time for that one, Doctor. It is as needed.
DOCTOR: Alright, so white pill twice a day, blue pill twice a day, and yellow pill as needed. That gives us a starting point. Now, let's briefly review your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any other medical conditions besides what we’ve discussed so far related to the surgery?
PATIENT: Let me see… I had… high blood pressure, many years ago. They put me on medication for that, but I believe it is under control now. And I had a bout of… shingles, some years ago as well. Very unpleasant, that was. But other than that, nothing significant. I have always been quite healthy, despite these recent… setbacks. I do not recall any other diagnoses, Doctor.
DOCTOR: High blood pressure, managed with medication, and a history of shingles. Thank you. And are you currently taking any medication for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Yes, I am. A small pink pill, I believe. I take it every morning, with my breakfast. It gives me a slight headache sometimes, but my doctor said it is important to keep my blood pressure under control. It is a very low dosage, I believe. My ex-wife said so. I cannot recall the name, Doctor. I wish I could be more helpful.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Mr. Bahta. It's helpful to know you are taking something for blood pressure. We'll get the specifics. Now, to finish up with your medical history, are there any allergies we should be aware of—to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I have never had an allergic reaction to anything, as far as I know. I can eat anything, and I have never had a reaction to any medication. It is one thing I am grateful for, I suppose. My ex-wife always double-checks, of course. But she has never found anything. No, I have no allergies. I can assure you.
DOCTOR: No known allergies. That's good to know. Now, Mr. Bahta, before we move on to the physical exam, could you tell me a little bit about your family history?
PATIENT: My family history… hmm. My mother, she lived to be eighty-nine. She had… arthritis, I believe. And my father, he passed away from a heart attack when he was seventy. He smoked, you see. And my brother… he has diabetes, type two, I think. Other than that, not much that I recall. No history of cancer, or any other major illnesses, as far as I know. It is a rather unremarkable family history, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Mother with arthritis, father with heart disease, brother with type two diabetes. Thank you. Now, finally, to get a full picture, could you tell me a bit about your social history?
PATIENT: My social history… well. I am divorced, as you know. No children. I live alone, in a small apartment in the city. I do not have many… close friends. I used to enjoy gardening, but my… condition makes that difficult now. I mostly stay indoors, and read. Or watch television. I do not drink alcohol, and I have never smoked. It is a rather… solitary existence, Doctor. But I manage.
DOCTOR: Divorced, no children, lives alone, enjoys reading, no alcohol or tobacco use. Alright, Mr. Bahta. Thank you for sharing all of that information with me. Now, I'd like to perform a brief physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That is perfectly alright. Please, proceed. I understand it is necessary. I trust your judgement.
DOCTOR: Excellent. First, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a few deep breaths for me. Heart sounds are regular, but a slightly rapid rate. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Next, I’m going to palpate your abdomen. Please let me know if anything feels particularly tender. There is some tenderness to palpation in the lower abdomen, particularly in the left lower quadrant. No rebound tenderness or guarding. Do you feel any pain with that?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That is… where the pain is most prominent. It is not a sharp pain, but it is… uncomfortable. A dull ache, that intensifies with pressure. It is particularly noticeable when you press there. Right there. It is always tender there, to some degree. But it is more intense today, I think.
DOCTOR: I understand. I'm noting that tenderness. Now, I'm going to check your pulses and reflexes. Pulses are within normal limits. Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally. Finally, I’ll check your skin. Skin appears normal, no rashes or lesions. Alright, Mr. Bahta. That completes the brief physical exam. Based on the information you've provided and the exam findings – the tenderness in your lower abdomen, the constant pain, and your history of abdominal surgery with complications – it sounds like you may be experiencing chronic abdominal pain, potentially related to adhesions or other post-operative complications. However, further investigation is needed to determine the exact cause. Do you have any questions about the exam?
PATIENT: Adhesions… that is what the surgeon mentioned, years ago. I recall him saying something about that. And complications… yes. I have had many complications. So, what does this mean, Doctor? What further investigation is needed? And… will I require further surgery? I confess, the thought is… unsettling. I would prefer to avoid surgery, if possible. Do you have any questions for me? Perhaps something I have forgotten to mention?
DOCTOR: It's perfectly understandable to be concerned about further surgery, Mr. Bahta. Let's address your questions. Adhesions are bands of scar tissue that can form after surgery and can cause pain and blockages. The fact that your surgeon mentioned them years ago is significant. To determine the exact cause of your pain, I recommend the following: 1. Blood tests: To rule out infection or other underlying medical conditions. 2. Imaging studies: A CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis to visualize the abdominal organs and look for adhesions, blockages, or other abnormalities. 3. Possible referral to a gastroenterologist: A specialist in digestive disorders, who can perform additional tests, such as a colonoscopy or endoscopy, if needed. Regarding surgery, it's too early to say whether it will be necessary. We need to gather more information first. However, if imaging studies reveal a significant blockage or other abnormality, surgery may be considered to relieve the pain and improve your quality of life. Now, as for questions for you, is the pain constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It is… mostly constant, Doctor. There are moments, perhaps after taking my medication, where it subsides. But it is always there, to some degree. It is rarely completely absent. And it tends to worsen after eating, or if I exert myself. Even a simple walk can exacerbate it. It is a… nagging sensation, a dull ache that rarely leaves me. Does that answer your question?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's very helpful, Mr. Bahta. Constant pain with exacerbations after eating and exertion. Based on all the information we've gathered—your history, the physical exam findings, and your description of the pain—I believe the most likely cause of your symptoms is chronic abdominal pain secondary to post-operative adhesions. However, as I mentioned before, we need to confirm this with further testing. I will order the blood tests and CT scan today. Once we have the results, we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and determine the best course of action. I will also provide a referral to Dr. Ramirez, a gastroenterologist, who can perform additional tests if needed. In the meantime, continue taking your current medications as prescribed. If your pain becomes significantly worse, or if you develop any new symptoms, such as fever, nausea, vomiting, or changes in your bowel habits, please contact me immediately. Do you have any questions about any of that?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I believe I understand. Blood tests, a CT scan, and a referral to Dr. Ramirez. Continue my medications, and contact you if my condition worsens. That is perfectly clear. So, you believe this Dr. Ramirez can… help? Perhaps identify the adhesions? Or… provide some relief? I confess, I am growing rather weary of the pain. It affects everything, Doctor. Everything.
DOCTOR: I understand your weariness, Mr. Bahta, and it’s completely valid. Dr. Ramirez is an excellent gastroenterologist, and she specializes in diagnosing and treating chronic abdominal pain. She can perform procedures, like a colonoscopy or endoscopy, to visualize your digestive tract and identify any blockages or abnormalities caused by adhesions. She’ll also have experience in managing pain through medication or other therapies. It's important to remember that identifying the exact cause of chronic pain can be challenging, and treatment may involve a trial-and-error approach. However, Dr. Ramirez will work closely with you to develop a personalized plan that addresses your specific needs and goals. I will have my nurse send you the necessary paperwork for the blood tests and a list of gastroenterologists in the area, including Dr. Ramirez's contact information. She can also assist you with scheduling the CT scan and an appointment with Dr. Ramirez. Do you have any questions before we wrap up?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I believe you have answered all of my questions. You have been most helpful, and I appreciate your patience. Please, tell your nurse to send the paperwork. I will… take it from there. Thank you, again, Dr. Alanes. And please, give my regards to your nurse. She sounds… very efficient.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Bahta. I’m glad I could help. And I will certainly pass along your kind regards to my nurse, Sarah. She is very efficient. Please, don't hesitate to contact us if you have any questions or concerns along the way. I wish you all the best, and I hope we can find a solution to your pain soon. Take care, Mr. Bahta.
