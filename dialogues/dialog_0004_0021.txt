DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Parascondola. I’m Dr. Deschane. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. It's my foot, see? It's been swelling up real bad. Started a few days ago, and it just gets worse each day. It’s mostly this one, <points to left foot> but the other one feels a little funny too now.
DOCTOR: Hmm. A few days, you say?
PATIENT: Yeah, started last Tuesday, I think. August 1st, was it? I remember 'cause that was the day old Mrs. Henderson finally got her new cat. Always talking about that cat… Anyway, Tuesday it started, just a little puffiness. Now, look at it! <gestures towards his foot again> It's like a balloon.
DOCTOR: Right. And you mentioned the other foot feels a little funny now. Can you describe "funny"?
PATIENT: It's not painful, exactly. More... achy? Like after a long walk, you know? But I haven’t been on a long walk. Just feels tired, I guess. Not as bad as this one, though. This one… this one is worrying me. It feels warm too, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Okay. Warm to the touch. And just to clarify, this swelling started in the left foot and is now present in the right, but less severe?
PATIENT: Exactly! You got it, Doctor. Started on the left, and now the right one's starting to join the party, but it’s still small. The left one… it’s really puffed up. I tried putting my sock on this morning and it was a real struggle, honestly. Had to get a bigger size sock just for today.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any changes in the skin of either foot?
PATIENT: Changes? Hmm… let me see. <looks down at his foot, wiggles his toes> It feels a little tight, like the skin is stretched real thin. And maybe a little redder than usual? It’s hard to tell, I got dark skin, you know. It’s not like it’s bright red, just… different. Not as brown as it normally is, maybe?
DOCTOR: Okay. And have you experienced any injuries to either foot recently?
PATIENT: No, no injuries. Definitely didn't twist it or anything. I've been pretty careful. I mostly just sit at my desk all day at work, filling out forms. Loan stuff, you know? No running, no jumping, no nothing. I'd remember if I bumped it or something, for sure. This just… happened. It's strange.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any other medical problems, Mr. Parascondola?
PATIENT: Not really. I get a little bit of high blood pressure, the doctor told me a while back, but I don't take any pills for it. He said to watch my salt, but I forget sometimes. And my knees get achy in the winter, but that’s just old age, I think. Other than that, I'm pretty good for a sixty-year-old, if I do say so myself. Never been a big fan of doctors, so I don't go unless I have to.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications at all?
PATIENT: No, like I said, nothing. Just try to avoid too much salt, which is harder than it sounds with all the good food around. I do take a vitamin D supplement sometimes in the winter, but that’s it. Just the one, when I remember. I get a lot of my vitamins from the fish I eat, though. Somali food, lots of fish. It’s good for you, I hear.
DOCTOR: Okay. And do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope, no allergies. I can eat anything, pretty much. Never had a problem with shellfish, peanuts, nothing. My mother always said I had an iron stomach, and I think she was right. I can try all sorts of foods and I'm usually okay. Never had to carry an EpiPen or anything like that.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, can you tell me about your family's medical history?
PATIENT: That's a tough one, Doctor. My family... well, most of them are still back in Somalia. We don't talk a lot about medical stuff. My mother, she lived to be very old, but she had some trouble with her joints when she got older, arthritis, I think. My father, he had some heart problems, but he died young. Other than that, not much that I know of. It’s hard to keep track when you’re far away, you know? We don’t have fancy records like you have here.
DOCTOR: I understand. And finally, do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any other substances?
PATIENT: No, no smoking. Never touched a cigarette in my life. And I don’t drink alcohol, not really. Maybe a little sip of wine with dinner sometimes, on special occasions, but that’s it. And no, nothing else either. I’m a pretty clean liver, if I do say so myself. I like my health, I try to take care of it. That's why I’m here, right? To get this foot figured out. It’s worrying me, this swelling.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, let’s take a look at this foot. Can you point to any specific areas that are particularly tender or painful?
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. <lifts his left foot onto the exam table> It's mostly right here, on the top of the foot, <points to the instep> and a little bit around the ankle bone here. <points to his medial malleolus> Not a sharp pain, just… ouch when I press on it. And it feels warm all over, like I said. Go ahead, take a look. I'm a little worried, honestly. It's just gotten worse so fast.
DOCTOR: Alright, I'm noting some swelling and warmth here, and it does feel tender when I press. I'm also checking your pulses. <palpates the dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses, noting a slightly diminished but palpable dorsalis pedis pulse> Your pulses are present, but a bit weak on this side. I'm also going to check the range of motion in your ankle. <gently moves Mr. Parascondola's foot up and down and side to side, noting some mild discomfort but full range of motion>. Do you feel any numbness or tingling in your foot?
PATIENT: No numbness or tingling, Doctor. Just the tenderness when you press on it, like you said. And that little bit of warmth. It's a strange feeling. Not a burning, just… warm. Like I’ve been walking a lot, but I haven’t. And you said weak pulses? Is that bad? That doesn’t sound good, does it? Is this something serious? I'm starting to get a little worried now.
DOCTOR: Alright. Weak pulses can indicate a few things, and it's something we'll want to investigate further. It doesn't necessarily mean it’s serious, but we need to rule out any potential problems with circulation. Given the swelling, warmth, tenderness, and slightly diminished pulse, my concern is a possible deep vein thrombosis, or DVT, or potentially cellulitis. I’m also considering a sprain, but the lack of a clear injury makes that less likely. To be certain, we’ll need to order some blood work and an ultrasound of your leg. The ultrasound will help us visualize the veins and see if there's any clot formation. The blood work will check for signs of infection. Would you be okay with that?
PATIENT: Blood work and an ultrasound? Oh boy. That sounds… serious. Is it expensive? I don't have insurance, you know. And a clot… that doesn’t sound good at all. Is it painful? Will I have to go to the hospital? I just came in for a swollen foot! <fidgets with his hands> I don’t want any trouble. But, if you think it’s necessary, I guess I’m okay with it. I want to know what’s going on, I don’t want to just sit here worrying. So, yes, okay. Do what you think is best, Doctor. Just tell me how much it’s going to cost.
DOCTOR: Alright. I understand your concerns, Mr. Parascondola. It's best to be thorough. I'll order the blood work and ultrasound right away. As for the cost, without insurance, the blood work will likely be around $150-$200, and the ultrasound can range from $300-$500, depending on the facility. I will have the billing department contact you with a more precise estimate before proceeding. We can also discuss payment options, if needed. I'll also prescribe you a compression stocking to wear on your left leg. This will help reduce swelling and improve circulation while we wait for the test results. And I want you to elevate your leg as much as possible and avoid prolonged standing or sitting. If you experience any sharp pain, worsening swelling, or shortness of breath, go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: Compression stocking… okay. That sounds… manageable. And elevating my leg, I can do that. $150 to $500… oh boy. I’ll have to see what I can do. Sharp pain or shortness of breath… okay, I’ll remember that. I just want this to go away, you know? I just want to be able to walk without feeling like my foot is going to explode. <sighs> So, the stocking… how do I get that? Do I need a special one? And will the blood work and ultrasound take long? I got work tomorrow, you know. I can’t just stay off my feet forever.
DOCTOR: Yes, you will need a special compression stocking. It needs to be fitted properly to ensure it provides the right amount of compression. I'll write you a prescription for one, and you can pick it up at the pharmacy. They will measure your leg to get the correct size. As for the tests, the blood work should be completed within a few hours, and the ultrasound can usually be scheduled for tomorrow morning. It will take about 30-45 minutes. We should have the results back by the end of the day tomorrow. I’ll have my nurse call you with the specific times and locations. In the meantime, try to rest and keep your leg elevated. And please, don't hesitate to contact us if you experience any worsening symptoms. Do you have any other concerns at this time?
PATIENT: Okay, a prescription for a stocking… got it. Pharmacy, tomorrow, ultrasound... I think I’ve got it all. That's a lot. <rubs his forehead> Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very helpful, even if it’s a lot to take in. I guess I’ll just try to rest and wait for the results. And I will call if anything changes. Shortness of breath… I won’t forget that. <pauses> No, I don’t think I have any other questions right now. Just… a lot to think about. Thank you again, Doctor Deschane. <starts to rise slowly from the exam table> I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me.
DOCTOR: Alright. You’re welcome, Mr. Parascondola. We’ll do our best to get to the bottom of this. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. My nurse will be in touch to schedule the tests and provide further instructions. Get some rest, and we'll talk soon. .
