DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Uzarski. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Seil. It's good to meet you. To start, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. It's…Teretha. Just Teretha is fine. Well, to be honest, it's my hands and feet. They've been…tingling. Like pins and needles, you know? It's been going on for a little while now, and I figured I should get it checked out before it gets worse. I don’t want to waste your time, I have a route to finish today.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Teretha. No need to worry about wasting my time – that's what I'm here for. And we’ll try to be as efficient as possible, understanding you have a route to finish. So, tingling in your hands and feet… and you said it's been going on for “a little while.” Could you tell me approximately how long?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think… maybe three, four weeks now? It comes and goes, you know? Some days it's barely noticeable, and other days… well, it's just annoying. Makes it hard to sort the mail sometimes, and walking… walking isn’t as easy either. It's mostly in my fingers and toes, but sometimes it goes up my arms and legs a little. I really just hope it's nothing serious. I can't afford a lot of… fuss.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds quite bothersome, and we'll certainly try to figure out what's going on. It’s good you’re getting it checked out. Okay, so tingling in your fingers and toes, occasionally extending up your arms and legs, for approximately three to four weeks, with varying intensity. Has anything specific seemed to trigger it or make it worse?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness…that’s a good question. Not that I’ve noticed, really. It doesn't seem to be worse after work, and it doesn't seem to be worse when it's cold. Maybe… maybe when I’m stressed? I lost my husband a few years back, and sometimes… well, sometimes the worry just gets to me. But I don't know if that makes sense. I try to keep busy, you know? Keeps my mind off things.
DOCTOR: That absolutely makes sense, Teretha. Stress can definitely manifest physically. It's good you're finding ways to stay busy; that's a very healthy coping mechanism. Now, let's go through a bit of your medical history, if you don't mind. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past, such as diabetes, thyroid problems, or arthritis?
PATIENT: Oh, no, not really. Just the usual aches and pains from being on my feet all day, you know? The doctor always said I was healthy as a horse. No diabetes, no thyroid… I don’t think so, anyway. And arthritis… my mother had that, but I haven’t felt anything like that myself. I haven’t been to a doctor in… well, a long time. Until now, of course.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to know. No history of those conditions. And you haven’t experienced any recent injuries to your hands or feet?
PATIENT: No, sir. No injuries. I’m very careful when I’m sorting. Gotta be! All those packages… and letters. I've bumped into things now and then, but nothing serious enough to cause this. Just… this tingling. It’s just strange.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, not a thing. I try to eat right, that's all. My mother always said a good diet is the best medicine. Just… regular food. Fruits, vegetables, you know. I don’t like taking pills if I can avoid it. They never seem to do much good anyway.
DOCTOR: I understand. That's good to know. And do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope, nothing that I know of. I’ve eaten pretty much everything over the years. Never had a reaction to anything. I’m a pretty simple woman, really. Just want to get back to my route, if you don’t mind.
DOCTOR: That's helpful to know, Teretha. We're getting a good picture here. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if you're comfortable with that. I'll check your reflexes, sensation, and circulation in your hands and feet. It shouldn't take long. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, yes, that's fine. Just hurry it up a little, if you can? The supervisor gets a bit… testy if I’m late. I don’t want to lose my job over a little tingling. Is there a table I can sit at for this? My feet are starting to ache just standing here.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Teretha. We’ll be as efficient as possible. Please, have a seat here. I'll start with your feet, and then we'll move to your hands. Okay, I’m going to lightly touch these areas with this brush. Please tell me when you can feel it. And try to tell me where you feel it, if possible. …And can you wiggle your toes for me?
PATIENT: Yes, alright. Wiggling… yes, I can wiggle them. Oh, yes, I feel that brush. Right… right there. And a little bit… over here. It feels… sort of dull. Not sharp, just… not as strong as it should be, I think. Like when your foot falls asleep, but not as… completely numb. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. "Dull" and "not as strong" is very helpful. And I'm noticing slightly diminished sensation in both feet, particularly on the outer edges. Your reflexes are a bit diminished as well, but not significantly. Now, let’s check your hands. Can you open and close your hands for me?
PATIENT: Yes, I can do that. Oh, and now my fingers are starting to feel a bit stiff. It's worse when it's cold, but it's not cold in here. It's just… there. And the tingling… it’s a little bit more noticeable now, I think. Is something wrong, Doctor? You’re making me nervous.
DOCTOR: It's okay to feel nervous, Teretha. We’re just gathering information right now. I'm noticing similar diminished sensation in your fingers, and your reflexes are also slightly reduced in your hands as well. I also observe some mild stiffness in your finger joints. Based on what you’ve told me and the preliminary exam findings, it could be a few things. One possibility is peripheral neuropathy – that's damage to the nerves outside of your brain and spinal cord. It can cause tingling, numbness, and weakness. Another possibility is a vitamin deficiency, though that's less likely given your diet. We'd need some tests to determine the exact cause. Would you be willing to get some bloodwork done?
PATIENT: Bloodwork…oh, goodness. I don’t like needles. But… if you think it's necessary, I guess I can do it. As long as it doesn't take too long. And… will it be expensive? I'm on a fixed income, you know. I don't want any surprises. Is there anything else I need to do? I really need to get back to my route, and I'm worried about falling behind.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns completely, Teretha. We will certainly take those into consideration. The bloodwork will help us rule out vitamin deficiencies and other potential causes. It's relatively quick – about 15-20 minutes – and we can try to schedule it for first thing tomorrow to minimize disruption to your route. As for the cost, we'll do our best to keep it affordable. I'll have the billing department check for any available assistance programs and discuss payment options with you. We don't want any surprises either. In the meantime, I recommend keeping your feet warm and dry. Avoid any activities that aggravate the tingling, if possible. And if the symptoms worsen suddenly—if you experience weakness, pain, or difficulty walking—please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Oh… well, that sounds… reasonable. First thing tomorrow would be best, yes. And thank you for checking on the cost, that’s very kind of you. I guess… I guess my question is… is this something serious? Will I have to stop working? I really need my job, Doctor. I don’t have any family to help me out.
DOCTOR: That's a very valid concern, Teretha, and it's good you're asking. It’s too early to say definitively whether it’s serious or if it will affect your ability to work. That's what the bloodwork will help us determine. Many cases of peripheral neuropathy are mild and can be managed with lifestyle changes and medication, if needed. We will explore all available options and work together to find the best solution for you. I want to assure you that we’ll take this one step at a time. Let's get the bloodwork done tomorrow, and then we’ll discuss the results and create a plan. I won't let you just worry and figure things out on your own. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes… yes, that sounds… alright. One step at a time. I can do that. Tomorrow, first thing. And… thank you, Doctor. You’re very patient with an old woman like me. I suppose I should get going then. I have a route to finish, after all.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Teretha. And please, don't apologize for being an "old woman." You're a resilient woman taking care of yourself, and that's admirable. Here's the lab order for the bloodwork. It has the address and phone number of the lab. And please, don't hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or concerns before tomorrow. It was a pleasure meeting you, Teretha. We’ll see you tomorrow morning. And don't worry too much. We'll get to the bottom of this.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too. I guess I’ll… see you then.
