DOCTOR: Good morning, Carmaleta. It’s lovely to meet you. I’m Dr. Finco. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Ugh, morning. Look, I don’t have a lot of time, so let's just get right to it. I want to... have a baby. And I want it to be easy. My first one… well, it wasn’t. I just want to make sure I don’t have any… problems this time around. Is that what you do? Fix problems before they happen?
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely. We can definitely discuss planning a pregnancy and addressing any potential concerns you might have, to hopefully make things go as smoothly as possible. It’s wonderful you’re thinking ahead. So, it sounds like you’ve had a previous pregnancy… and you’re hoping this one will be different?
PATIENT: Right. Different. It was… complicated. Lots of tests, lots of worry. I don't really remember all the details, honestly. It was a long time ago. And my husband… he’s gone now. So I just want to avoid all that stress again. Can you... check if there’s anything wrong with me? That's what I need to know. Quickly.
DOCTOR: I understand. That sounds incredibly difficult, and it’s perfectly reasonable to want to feel prepared and avoid unnecessary worry. We can certainly do some tests to get a better picture of your overall health and identify any potential factors that could impact a pregnancy. To start, could you tell me a little bit about your previous pregnancy?
PATIENT: Ugh, fine. It was… normal, I guess. I mean, it eventually worked. But I was sick all the time. And then… there were complications near the end. I had to have a… a procedure. I don’t even really want to talk about it. Honestly, it's all a blur. And I was young then, I didn’t ask a lot of questions. He took care of all that. Is that helpful? I really don't see how remembering all of that is going to help me now.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s helpful. It gives me a starting point. The nausea is something we can address if it happens again. And knowing there was a procedure at the end helps me understand what to look for in your medical records. Do you happen to remember what kind of procedure it was?
PATIENT: No! Honestly, no. I told you, it was a long time ago, and I didn't pay attention to the details. He just told me what to do. I just... felt sick and tired. And then there was a baby. That's all I remember. Look, can't you just... run some tests? See if I'm even capable of having another one? That’s what I came here for. Before I get… too old.
DOCTOR: Of course. That’s absolutely what we can do. Running some tests is a great first step. We can check your overall health, hormone levels, and look for any potential issues that might affect your ability to conceive or carry a pregnancy. Before we order those tests, let me just ask a few quick questions about your medical history. Have you had any significant illnesses or surgeries since your previous pregnancy?
PATIENT: Ugh, let me think. No, not really. I had a bad flu a couple years ago, but that’s it. And I’ve had the usual… check-ups. I go to the dentist. Does that count? I don’t usually get sick. I try to eat healthy. Well, mostly. Look, I have private insurance, if that matters. I don’t want to be surprised with a huge bill. Just do the tests and tell me what’s wrong, okay?
DOCTOR: Yes, private insurance is helpful to know. And we will absolutely run the necessary tests and I’ll explain the results to you in detail, no surprises. Alright. Before the tests, can you tell me about any medications you’re currently taking?
PATIENT: Just… vitamins. A multivitamin, and sometimes calcium. I worry about my bones, you know? My mother… she had problems with her bones. That’s it. No prescriptions. I don’t like taking pills unless I have to. Is that all? Can we please just get this over with? I have an appointment later this afternoon. I really need to know if this is even possible before I start making plans.
DOCTOR: Yes, vitamins only. That’s good to know. And I understand your urgency. We will get this done as quickly as possible. Just a few more questions, then we can move on to the physical exam and ordering the tests. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No! None. I eat everything. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. Honestly, I’m a very healthy person. I just... want a baby. And I want to know if my body can even do it. Is that too much to ask? Look, can we skip the physical? I really don't feel like getting poked and prodded right now. Just run the tests, okay? Please.
DOCTOR: I understand your reluctance. However, a brief physical exam can give me some important baseline information—blood pressure, heart rate, a quick check of your thyroid—just to make sure everything is functioning as it should. It really won't take long, maybe five minutes, and it can help me interpret the test results more accurately. It’s just a precaution, and it might save us time and worry in the long run. Would you be willing to let me do a quick exam, or would you prefer we just proceed with the tests?
PATIENT: Ugh, fine. Five minutes. Five minutes, and then you have to order the tests. No extra poking and prodding, okay? I have things to do. And if you find something wrong, just tell me straight. I don't want any beating around the bush. Just the facts. Now, let’s get this over with.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. Five minutes, and straight to the facts. That’s exactly what we’ll do. Alright, let’s start with your blood pressure. Could you please sit up and I’ll wrap the cuff around your arm?
PATIENT: Just… hurry. I really don’t like doctors’ offices. They always smell funny. And the waiting rooms are full of germs. Is this going to hurt?
DOCTOR: It won’t hurt at all. It just feels a little tight around your arm for a few seconds. Okay, I’m going to inflate the cuff now. Just relax and breathe normally. Okay, your blood pressure is 128 over 76, which is perfectly normal. Now, I’m just going to listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart and lungs sound clear. Everything sounds good so far. Now, just a quick look at your thyroid... Your thyroid feels normal as well. Alright, that’s it. Five minutes, just as promised. Now we can proceed with the tests. I'll order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a hormone panel to assess your overall health and reproductive function. Do you have any questions before I get that ordered?
PATIENT: No. Just… order them. And tell me how long it will take to get the results. I don’t want to be waiting around for weeks. I have a life, you know? And can I just… go? I need to get to my appointment. Is there anything else you need before I leave? Seriously.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I completely understand. The lab results typically take 3-5 business days to come back. The lab will likely have a portal where you can view them online once they are available, or we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them in detail. No, there’s nothing else I need right now. Here’s a lab requisition form. You can take this to any lab that accepts our insurance. Thank you for coming in today, Carmaleta. I hope we can get some answers for you soon. Please don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. .
PATIENT: Fine. Thanks. I’ll… call if I need to. .
