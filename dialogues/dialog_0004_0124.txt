DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Paes. I’m Dr. Deschane. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, I’ve been feeling really tired lately, and my skin… it’s just gotten darker. Not like a sunburn, just… overall darker than usual. It's been going on for a couple of months now, I think. Maybe three? It’s hard to say exactly.
DOCTOR: Okay. Three months of increasing fatigue and changes in skin pigmentation. And you say “overall darker,” not localized patches?
PATIENT: Right, not patches. It's… everywhere, I guess. My face, my arms, even my legs. It's not itchy or painful, just… noticeable. I don’t tan easily, so this is different than usual. I usually stay out of the sun when I can.
DOCTOR: Alright. And has anything changed in your life recently?
PATIENT: Hmm… not really, not that I can think of. Work’s the same, I’m still single, haven’t been traveling or anything. Oh! Wait a minute. I did start taking a new vitamin a few months ago. A friend recommended it for energy. It’s… something with B vitamins, I think. A really long name. I can try to remember the name if that helps?
DOCTOR: Yes, please do. The exact name is quite important. And how much of this vitamin are you taking daily?
PATIENT: Let me see… the bottle… Here it is. It’s called… B-Complex VitaBoost, with added Ginseng. And I take… one tablet every morning with breakfast. It's a pretty big tablet, actually. I think it has like, a thousand micrograms of each B vitamin? Does that sound right?
DOCTOR: A thousand micrograms each?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds about right. It’s a pretty strong one, my friend said it was the best for getting your energy up. But now that you say it… I haven't really noticed that much of a difference in my energy, just the skin thing. Is that… a lot? I’m not good with numbers.
DOCTOR: Ms. Paes, a thousand micrograms of each B vitamin is… exceptionally high. Many B vitamins are water-soluble, meaning your body will excrete excess, but very high doses can still cause side effects. And one potential side effect is, in fact, changes in skin pigmentation. Let's take a look at your baseline labs. Do you have any known kidney issues?
PATIENT: Kidney issues? No, not that I know of. I’ve never been told anything about my kidneys. I get a checkup every year with my primary care doctor, and everything’s always been fine. Usually just blood pressure and cholesterol, I think. I’ve never had any specific tests for my kidneys. Should I have?
DOCTOR: Routine kidney function tests aren’t always included in a standard yearly checkup, especially if you haven’t had any issues in the past. However, given your symptoms and the high dose of B vitamins you’re taking, I think it’s prudent to get some blood work done today. We’ll check your kidney function, liver function, and vitamin B levels. In the meantime, I strongly advise you to stop taking the B-Complex VitaBoost immediately. It’s unlikely to be helpful, and it could be contributing to your symptoms. Does that sound agreeable?
PATIENT: Yes, absolutely. Stopping the vitamins sounds smart. I haven’t felt any better taking them, so it makes sense. And I trust your judgment, Doctor. So, blood work today? Is there anything special I need to do to prepare? Like, should I fast?
DOCTOR: Yes, blood work today. And yes, please fast for eight hours beforehand. That means no food or drinks, other than water. We’ll take the samples first thing, and I’ll have the results sent to me as soon as they're available, usually within 24-48 hours. We can then schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the findings and determine the next steps. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. Fasting, stop the vitamins, follow-up appointment. That sounds good. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me. It’s been a little worrying, so I’m glad we’re getting it checked out.
DOCTOR: You're welcome, Ms. Paes. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood. She'll provide you with instructions for fasting if you have any further questions. Please let us know if you experience any sudden changes in your condition while you are waiting for the results. We’ll get to the bottom of this.
PATIENT: Okay, great. I will. Thank you again. I’ll just wait here, then.
DOCTOR: Very well. .
