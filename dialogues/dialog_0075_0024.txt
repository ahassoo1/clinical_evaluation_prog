DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Sayar. I’m Dr. Panjoj. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. I need a letter confirming I’m able to fly. It’s… a bit complicated, but I recently lost my husband, and the airline is requesting it before I can travel to see family. They just need a doctor’s note saying I'm fit enough to travel, I think.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Sayar. That sounds very difficult, and I'm happy to help in any way I can. Losing a husband is… a significant loss. It’s good of you to want to be with family. To write that letter for you, I'll need to ask a few questions, just to be thorough. It's standard procedure, and it helps ensure your safety during travel. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. That makes perfect sense. Ask away, Doctor. I want to get this sorted as quickly as possible, if that’s alright. I’m reasonably healthy, I think, but…well, grief does things to a person, doesn’t it?
DOCTOR: It absolutely does, Ms. Sayar. It impacts everything. We’ll take things at your pace. First, can you tell me a bit about your general health?
PATIENT: Well, I’m 33, and up until recently I was very active. I used to go hiking almost every weekend with my husband. I don’t have any major illnesses, no diabetes, no heart problems… I had the usual childhood things, measles, chickenpox, but nothing serious. I’m generally a healthy weight, I think – 176 centimeters and around 60 kilograms. I do have Medicare, if that’s helpful. I haven't really been to a doctor in years, to be honest, unless something was really wrong.
DOCTOR: That's good to know. Height 176 centimeters, weight 60 kilograms, age 33… no significant medical history reported. And you said you were very active until recently. Has your activity level changed significantly since your husband’s passing?
PATIENT: Yes, drastically. It’s… hard to motivate myself, honestly. We did everything together. Now… I mostly stay home. I try to go for short walks sometimes, but it’s not the same. I get tired easily, even doing simple things. It's probably just the grief, though. I'm not really sick, just… exhausted and sad. I haven’t been feeling like myself at all.
DOCTOR: I understand. Fatigue and changes in activity level are very common with grief, and it's important to acknowledge how profound an impact that can have. But we still need to rule out any other potential causes, just to be certain. Have you been experiencing any other symptoms besides fatigue?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No fever, no cough, no body aches. I’ve been sleeping okay, sometimes too much, sometimes not enough, but nothing consistent. I have been a little more… anxious than usual, I suppose. Worrying a lot. And… my appetite has been all over the place. Some days I can barely eat, others I’m constantly hungry. I also get headaches, but they’re not terrible, just… nagging. I don’t think any of it is serious, though. Just… off. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s very helpful, Ms. Sayar. Changes in sleep, appetite, and increased anxiety are all common with grief, as are headaches. It sounds like you're describing a very understandable reaction to a significant loss. To get a fuller picture, could you tell me a little about any medications you're currently taking, or any allergies you have?
PATIENT: No medications at all, Doctor. Never have been on any. And no allergies that I know of. I’m pretty good with everything – food, pollen, animals…nothing bothers me. I’ve always been quite healthy, really. It’s just… this. Losing David has just thrown everything off. I hope this isn’t taking up too much of your time. I know you're busy.
DOCTOR: Not at all, Ms. Sayar. It's important to me that we take the time to address your concerns fully. And no medications or allergies, that's good to know. Now, just to complete the picture, have you had any significant surgeries or hospitalizations in the past?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. I broke my arm when I was a kid, a silly fall from a tree, but that was it. Just a simple fracture, nothing major. Everything else has been…normal. Really. I’m usually very healthy. I just want to get this letter so I can go see my family. They’re worried about me too, you know? It’s been a long few months.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Sayar. No surgeries or hospitalizations, just a childhood broken arm. That’s all very helpful. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, just to be thorough. It's standard procedure, and it won't take long. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and do a brief neurological assessment. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. Let’s just get it done, please. The sooner I can get this letter, the sooner I can get on that plane. I'm reasonably sure everything is fine, but I understand you need to check. I just… I miss my family.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Sayar. Let’s get started then. Please have a seat on the table. Your heart sounds regular and lungs are clear. Blood pressure is 120/80, which is within the normal range. Reflexes are normal, and neurological assessment is within normal limits. Everything appears to be within normal limits, Ms. Sayar. Based on your history and this brief exam, I don’t see any medical reason why you wouldn’t be able to travel. However, given your recent loss and reported fatigue and anxiety, I would like to strongly recommend that you travel with someone, if possible, and avoid strenuous activity during your trip. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds very reasonable, Doctor. I was planning on travelling with my sister, thankfully. She insisted. I’m glad you agree. And avoiding strenuous activity isn't a problem. I don't have much energy for that anyway, to be honest. So, can you write the letter now? I really appreciate you taking the time to see me, and for not dismissing me. Some doctors just… don’t listen.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Sayar. It's my job to listen, and I'm happy to help in any way I can. It's important to me that you feel comfortable and safe. “To Whom It May Concern: Ms. Kiante Sayar was evaluated in my office today, August 2nd, 2025. Ms. Sayar reports a recent significant loss, and while she is currently experiencing fatigue and anxiety related to her grief, a thorough evaluation revealed no medical contraindications to air travel. I recommend that Ms. Sayar travel with a companion and avoid strenuous activities during her trip. Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any further questions. Sincerely, Marchel Panjoj, MD” Here you go, Ms. Sayar. I hope this helps. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: Thank you so much, Doctor. This is perfect. You have no idea what a relief this is. No, I think that’s everything. I really appreciate your time and kindness. You’ve been a wonderful help. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Sayar. I’m glad I could help. Please take care of yourself, and don’t hesitate to reach out if you need anything in the future. Have a safe trip, and please give my best to your family. .
