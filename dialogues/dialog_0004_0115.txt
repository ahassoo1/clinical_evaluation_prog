DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Durig. I’m Dr. Deschane. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Well, it's… it's about my skin, you see. It’s turned rather… yellow. A friend suggested I come in. Something about my liver, I think? It’s all a bit muddled, honestly. I do apologize.
DOCTOR: Liver, you say. Alright. And when did you first notice this yellowing, Ms. Durig?
PATIENT: Oh dear… when did I notice it? It feels like… a few weeks now? Perhaps a month? It’s difficult to say, truly. I haven’t been feeling quite myself, and I just… assumed it was old age catching up with me. Is it serious? I truly can’t recall exactly when it started.
DOCTOR: A month, approximately. And you said you haven’t been feeling yourself. Can you be more specific about that?
PATIENT: Specific… oh, goodness. Just… tired, mostly. Very tired. And a little… uncomfortable, you know? Around my stomach. Not pain, exactly. More like… a fullness. And a lack of appetite. I haven’t been eating much lately. It’s all rather unpleasant. Do forgive me for being so vague. I haven’t been to a doctor in… well, a very long time.
DOCTOR: It's alright, Ms. Durig. We'll get to the bottom of it. "Uncomfortable around your stomach" and loss of appetite… have you noticed any changes in your bowel movements?
PATIENT: Bowel movements… oh. Well, they’ve been… paler, I think? Yes, paler than usual. And… less frequent. I do apologize, Doctor, this is all rather… private. I'm not accustomed to discussing such things. Is this… a sign of something grave?
DOCTOR: Pale stools, less frequent… alright. And have you noticed any dark urine?
PATIENT: Dark urine… hmm. Now that you mention it, yes. It has been darker than usual. A sort of… tea color, perhaps? I hadn't thought much of it, honestly. I just assumed it was something I was eating. Is that… concerning, Doctor? Everything seems to be concerning all of a sudden! My memory isn't what it used to be, so I apologize if I'm missing things.
DOCTOR: Ms. Durig, it’s helpful that you’re mentioning these things, even if you're unsure. This could be indicative of a liver issue, as your friend suspected. I’d like to do a physical exam and order some blood work to get a clearer picture. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course, Doctor. Anything you think is best. Blood work… a physical exam… yes. Whatever it takes to find out what’s going on. I just want to feel… normal again. Do you think… do you think it’s serious? And will it… hurt? I do apologize for all the questions. I am rather anxious.
DOCTOR: The blood work is standard, a simple draw. The physical exam will involve listening to your abdomen, feeling for any tenderness, and checking your skin. It shouldn't be painful. As for how serious it is, we can't know yet – that's what the tests are for. I'll need to assess your overall condition first. Let's start with the exam. Please lie down on the examination table.
PATIENT: Oh, alright. An examination table… yes. Here we go… I do hope I'm not too much trouble, Doctor. My bones aren’t as pliable as they used to be. Please, just tell me what you need me to do. And do apologize for my… rambling.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Durig. Just relax. Breathe normally. Hmm. There’s some tenderness here, on the right side. Lungs are clear. Heart sounds regular. Jaundice is present, as we suspected. Overall, you appear slightly fatigued, and your skin is dry. Alright. That’s enough for now. I’m going to order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a liver function test. We'll also need to check your bilirubin levels. It will take a couple of days to get the results back.
PATIENT: Oh, very well. Bilirubin… those are… numbers, aren’t they? A couple of days… yes. That sounds… reasonable. I do hope it isn’t anything too alarming, Doctor. What exactly will these tests tell you? And will they… require more poking and prodding? I really do appreciate you taking the time with me, Doctor. My mind isn’t what it used to be and I’m a bit of a worrier. Do you have any immediate thoughts?
DOCTOR: Ms. Durig, the tests will give us a detailed picture of your liver function, kidney function, and overall health. The liver function test, specifically, will tell us if there's inflammation or damage. As for “more poking and prodding,” it’s possible we may need further imaging if these initial tests are inconclusive. But let's not get ahead of ourselves. Right now, we need to wait for the results. I will have the nurse draw your blood now. And I’m going to prescribe a bland diet – easily digestible foods – until we have more information. Avoid fatty foods, alcohol, and strenuous activity. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Oh, a bland diet… yes, that sounds sensible. No fatty foods… alcohol… well, I haven’t touched a drop in years. Allergies… hmm. No, I don't believe so. Not that I’m aware of, at least. It’s been a very long time since I’ve taken anything. Though… I did have a rather unpleasant reaction to a cream once, many, many years ago. It caused a rash… but I can't recall the name of the cream. Perhaps it wasn’t an allergy, just… sensitivity? Oh, dear. I'm truly sorry for being so unhelpful. I just want to get to the bottom of this. And thank you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: A rash, you say. Alright. We’ll note “possible sensitivity to topical creams.” Look, Ms. Durig, it’s fine. We’ll figure this out. The nurse will be in shortly to take your blood. And then we wait for the results. Please call the office if you experience any worsening symptoms – severe abdominal pain, fever, or if your skin becomes more yellow. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, I understand, Doctor. Worsening symptoms… abdominal pain, fever… more yellowing. I will call. Thank you, Doctor Deschane. Truly. I do apologize for taking up so much of your time and being… well, you know. I hope these tests don't reveal anything too serious. I believe I shall just wait here then, shall I?
DOCTOR: Very well. The nurse will be with you shortly. .
