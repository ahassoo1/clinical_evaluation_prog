DOCTOR: Hi Maribeth, it’s lovely to meet you. I’m Dr. Decosta. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s my breathing. It’s been giving me trouble when I try to lie flat. It feels… difficult. I don’t know how else to explain it. I just want to get this sorted out, if you don’t mind.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Difficulty breathing when lying flat can be concerning, and we’ll definitely look into it. When did you first notice this trouble breathing when lying down?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… it started… about three weeks ago, I believe. Yes, three weeks. It wasn’t sudden, it just… gradually got worse. At first, I just needed an extra pillow. Now… well, now it’s quite noticeable. I used to sleep just fine, you know.
DOCTOR: Okay, gradually worsening over three weeks. And it’s gotten to the point where it’s quite noticeable now. Do you notice any other symptoms when you're having trouble breathing – like wheezing, coughing, or any chest pain?
PATIENT: No, no wheezing. And I haven’t had a cough to speak of. No chest pain either, thankfully. It’s just… shortness of breath. A feeling of… being squeezed, maybe? But not a painful squeeze. It’s hard to describe, really. It’s just… uncomfortable. I do get a little anxious when it happens, I suppose, which doesn’t help.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no wheezing, cough, or chest pain, just shortness of breath and a feeling of being squeezed – though not painful – and some anxiety when it happens. That’s helpful. Do you notice if anything specifically triggers the shortness of breath, besides lying flat?
PATIENT: Hmm… not that I’ve noticed, no. It doesn’t seem to be worse with activity, or after eating, or anything like that. Just… lying down. It's very peculiar. I’ve been trying to sleep in my chair, which isn’t ideal, but it’s better than struggling all night. I just want to be able to sleep in my bed again.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it’s really isolated to lying flat, and doesn’t seem to be triggered by anything else. Sleeping in a chair isn’t ideal, I agree. Let's talk a little bit about your overall health. Do you have any other medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Well, I had my gallbladder removed years ago, but that was… oh, goodness, must be twenty years now. And I have a bit of arthritis in my knees, but it's nothing too serious. I manage it with over-the-counter pain relievers. Otherwise, I’ve been quite healthy, all things considered. I’ve always tried to eat a good diet and stay active when I could. I have Medicare, if that's important.
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder removal twenty years ago and some arthritis in your knees, managed with over-the-counter medication. And otherwise generally healthy. Thank you for letting me know about your Medicare as well. Now, are you currently taking any medications, besides the over-the-counter pain relievers for your knees?
PATIENT: No, just the pain relievers when my knees bother me. That’s it. I try to avoid taking medication whenever possible. I don’t like the way they make me feel. Just the ibuprofen, when I really need it. Not every day, mind you. Perhaps two or three times a week, if that. It's a low dose.
DOCTOR: Okay, just ibuprofen as needed for your knees, a low dose, and not every day. And do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, no allergies that I’m aware of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. I eat… well, I eat most things. I enjoy Zuni cuisine, naturally, and I haven’t had any trouble with any of the ingredients. I’ve always been a fairly robust person, health-wise. Though this breathing is concerning, of course.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. That’s good. Now, let's talk a little bit about your family history. Are there any heart or lung problems that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. My mother had high blood pressure, I believe. And my father… he had a bit of a cough later in life, but I don’t know if it was anything serious. No one else that I can recall had any significant heart or lung issues. Mostly just the usual aches and pains of getting older. My family… we weren’t really the type to discuss such things openly. Do you need me to be more specific? I'm not very good at remembering these things.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright. High blood pressure in your mother is good to know. It’s not always easy to recall family history. Finally, could you tell me a little bit about your social history?
PATIENT: Oh. Well, I'm divorced. It was a long time ago. I live alone, here in town. I don’t smoke, never have. I used to drink a little wine with dinner, but I haven’t had a glass in years. I used to be quite active in the community, but… well, I’ve slowed down a bit lately. I prefer to spend my time quietly, at home. Is this what you were asking about? I'm not sure I understand what you mean by “social history.”
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s exactly what I was asking about. Thank you for sharing that. Alright, Maribeth, that gives me a good overview. Now, I’d like to listen to your lungs and heart, and check your oxygen levels. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just want to figure out what’s going on. Please, go ahead. I do hope it’s nothing too serious. I’d really like to get back to sleeping in my bed.
DOCTOR: Alright, let's take a listen. Please take a few deep breaths for me, in through your nose and out through your mouth. Okay, your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear when you're sitting up. Now, could you lie back down for me, please?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Here I am. It… it's already a little harder to breathe, you know. It’s much more noticeable when I'm lying flat. I hope you can hear something. It feels… tighter now.
DOCTOR: Okay. I do hear a slight crackling sound in the lower part of your lungs on both sides when you're lying down. Your oxygen saturation is 92% while lying flat, which is a little low, though not critically so. It was 97% when you were sitting up. It sounds like you might be experiencing some fluid buildup in your lungs, which is making it harder to breathe when you lie down. This can be caused by a few different things, including heart problems, kidney issues, or even pneumonia, though I don't hear anything that strongly suggests pneumonia at this point. We'll need to do some further testing to figure out the cause.
PATIENT: Oh dear. Fluid buildup… that doesn’t sound good. Kidney issues? I hadn’t even considered that. What kind of testing are we talking about? And will it be… unpleasant? I just want to get to the bottom of this, but I’m not very fond of hospitals or… complicated procedures. I hope it’s not too serious.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Maribeth. Let's take things one step at a time. The testing we’ll start with is relatively simple. I’d like to order a chest X-ray to get a better look at your lungs and heart. We’ll also do a blood test to check your kidney function, your heart enzymes, and look for any signs of infection. We’ll also check your levels of something called BNP, which can help us determine if your shortness of breath is related to heart failure. These are both standard tests, and shouldn’t be too uncomfortable. The blood test will just involve a small prick of the finger or arm. The X-ray is painless, and only takes a few minutes. I’ll send you to the lab and radiology department here in the clinic. We’ll get the results back within a day or two, and then we can discuss the next steps. It’s too early to say definitively what’s causing your symptoms, but these tests will give us a much clearer picture. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: That… that sounds manageable, yes. A blood test and an X-ray. I can do that. As long as it doesn’t involve… anything too invasive. And within a day or two? That’s… reassuring. I just want to know what’s going on and get it sorted out. Where do I go for the tests? And should I… prepare in any way? I don’t want to make a fuss. Just point me in the right direction, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. The lab is just down the hall to your left, room 102. They’ll draw the blood samples there. And the radiology department is right across the hall, room 105, where they’ll take the chest X-ray. You don’t need to prepare in any way for either test – just wear comfortable clothing. I’m sending the orders to both departments now, so they’ll be expecting you. The receptionist at the front desk can give you more specific instructions, if needed. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. Just… comfortable clothing. And the receptionist will know where to send me? That's good. I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly, Doctor. I just want to get this taken care of. I suppose I should go then. Thank you again for your help.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Maribeth. Don’t hesitate to ask if anything comes up. The receptionist will guide you through everything. We’ll get to the bottom of this, and hopefully get you back to sleeping comfortably in your own bed soon. Take care, and I’ll see you when the results are back.
