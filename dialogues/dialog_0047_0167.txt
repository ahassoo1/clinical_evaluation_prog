DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Stoegbauer. I’m Dr. Press. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. It’s my foot, you see. It’s been… troublesome. A sore, a bad sore, on my foot. It won’t heal.
DOCTOR: Alright, a sore on your foot that isn’t healing. And how long has this been going on, exactly?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… It started… maybe two, three months ago? It was small at first, just a little red spot. I didn’t think much of it. Now… well, now it’s bigger. And it hurts. Especially when I walk.
DOCTOR: And where on your foot is this sore located, Mr. Stoegbauer?
PATIENT: It’s on the bottom of my foot, Doctor. Right near my toes, on this foot here. It’s hard to see, I suppose, because of my skin. It's not a pretty sight.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Yes, I see it. And would you describe the pain as sharp, dull, throbbing, or something else?
PATIENT: It’s… a dull ache, mostly. But when I put weight on it, like when I walk, it gets sharp. A real sharp pain. Makes me stop and rest. It's not a good feeling, I tell you. I used to walk every morning, but not so much now.
DOCTOR: And have you noticed any redness, swelling, pus, or any warmth around the sore?
PATIENT: Redness, yes. It's red around the edges. And maybe a little swollen, too. I haven't… I don't know about pus, Doctor. What does pus look like? I haven't seen anything… leaking, if that's what you mean. And warm? I haven't really felt it being warm, but I don't always notice those things. I am an old man, you see.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, let’s have a better look. Could you please sit back on the examination table and I’ll take a closer look at your foot?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. Just let me know if you need me to do anything. I hope it’s not too serious. I do like to walk, you see.
DOCTOR: Alright. It is quite inflamed. And there is some… discharge present, a yellowish color. It’s not a deep wound, but it’s definitely not healing on its own. Now, have you tried anything to treat it yourself?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. I put some… ointment on it. My daughter, Leilani, gave it to me. She's a nurse, you know. But it didn’t seem to help much. I cleaned it with soap and water, too. Just regular soap. I didn't want to bother you unless it was something serious. Is it… bad?
DOCTOR: Well, Mr. Stoegbauer, it’s not improving, and given the inflammation and discharge, it’s likely infected. It could be a simple infection we can treat with antibiotics, but we need to rule out anything more serious, particularly with your age and… well, potential for decreased circulation. I want to send a sample of this discharge to the lab for a culture, to identify exactly what we're dealing with. We'll also need to check your blood sugar levels to rule out diabetes, as that can significantly impact healing.
PATIENT: Diabetes? Oh dear. My mother… she had diabetes. Is that what this is? The slow healing, you mean? I don't feel sick, Doctor. I eat alright, mostly fish and rice. What does this… culture thing involve? Will it hurt? I don't like needles, you see.
DOCTOR: Now, Mr. Stoegbauer, I’m not saying you have diabetes. We simply need to rule it out. Many things can cause a wound to heal slowly. As for the culture, it’s a very quick procedure. We’ll take a small swab of the discharge from the sore—it will feel like a slight pressure, barely noticeable. It doesn't involve a needle. The lab will then analyze it to determine the specific bacteria causing the infection, and that will tell us what antibiotic will be most effective. It’s standard procedure. We also need a blood test to check your glucose levels. That will involve a small prick of a needle, but it’s very quick as well. Do you understand?
PATIENT: A prick of a needle… oh. Well, I suppose if it needs to be done. And you think it's something serious, then? Even with the medicine? I just want to be able to walk again. That’s all. It’s important to me. It keeps me… grounded, you see.
DOCTOR: It's important to be thorough, Mr. Stoegbauer. While it may not be serious, we need to be certain. The blood test and culture will give us the answers we need. We're ruling things out, not assuming the worst. I'll order those tests now. And yes, if it is an infection, antibiotics will likely be necessary. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. I don’t think so. Never had a reaction to anything, as far as I remember. My daughter, Leilani, always says I’m too stubborn to even feel sick. But no, I don't think I have any allergies. She would have mentioned it, wouldn't she? Will the blood test take long? I have to get home to water my orchids. They’re very delicate.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, it’s always best to be certain, even if you don’t recall any allergies. The blood test shouldn’t take long—a few minutes, at most. We'll get the results back within a day or two. In the meantime, I want you to keep the area clean and dry, and elevate your foot as much as possible. Avoid putting any weight on it. I’ll have the nurse come in and draw the blood and explain everything to you in more detail. I’ll also write you a prescription for a topical antibiotic to start using in the meantime, while we await the culture results. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… alright, Doctor. Keep it clean, you said. And no walking. I can do that, I suppose. It’s just… difficult. Thank you, Doctor. Thank you for looking after me. I appreciate it very much. I hope it’s not too serious. And please tell Leilani thank you too, when you see her. She worries about me, you know. She's a good girl.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Stoegbauer. I’ll have the nurse come in shortly. And we'll do everything we can to get you back on your feet. Try not to worry too much.
