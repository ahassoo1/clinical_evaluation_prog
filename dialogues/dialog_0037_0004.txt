DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Fornes. My name is Dr. Octavis AX. It’s good to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Well, it's just a check-up, really. Routine immunizations, you know? Gotta keep up with those things. My husband reminded me it was time.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent, Ms. Fornes – very proactive of you and your husband. Routine preventative care is important. Just to confirm, are there any specific concerns you have besides staying up-to-date on immunizations?
PATIENT: No, not really. Nothing specific. I feel pretty good, actually. Just getting a little older, I guess! Everything seems to be working okay, for the most part.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. “Getting a little older” is something we all experience! Let’s go through a quick review of your medical history just to get a complete picture. I see here you're 53 years old. Do you have any chronic medical conditions – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, or arthritis?
PATIENT: Nope, not that I know of. My doctor back home – used to be Dr. Olsen – he always said I was pretty healthy. Just the usual aches and pains from working, you know? Construction work isn’t exactly gentle on the body.
DOCTOR: Right, construction work can definitely take a toll. And have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No, I don’t think so. Nothing major, anyway. I had my tonsils out when I was a kid, a long time ago, but that’s about it. Nothing as an adult, definitely.
DOCTOR: Okay, no adult surgeries. That’s helpful. Now, can you tell me about your family history?
PATIENT: Well, my mom, she had some heart trouble when she got older. And my dad… he had diabetes, I think. It was a long time ago, and I wasn’t really paying attention to all the details back then, to be honest. My brother’s pretty healthy, as far as I know. We don’t see each other much anymore. Is that the kind of thing you need to know?
DOCTOR: That’s good information, Ms. Fornes, thank you. Knowing about heart trouble and diabetes in your family is definitely helpful. And what about any allergies you have?
PATIENT: Nope, none that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything, not even poison ivy. I spend a lot of time outdoors with my work, and I’ve never had any trouble.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Are you currently taking any medications, prescription or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: Just some ibuprofen now and then for my back, when it’s really acting up. And sometimes a little something for a headache. Nothing regularly, though. Definitely not on any prescriptions.
DOCTOR: Alright, occasional ibuprofen. Now, let's talk a little bit about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, no, none of that. Never really been interested. I like my sleep too much! And my husband doesn’t approve, ha! I drink plenty of water, though, especially when I’m working in the sun.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, Ms. Fornes. Healthy habits are important. Now, before we move on to a physical exam, is there anything else you want to mention, anything at all, that you think might be relevant?
PATIENT: Hmm… no, I don't think so. You've pretty much covered everything, Doctor. I'm feeling pretty good, honestly. Just want to make sure I'm up to date on my shots, and I’m good.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. It sounds like you’ve given me a really good overview of your health. So, let's do a quick physical exam. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look in your ears, nose, and throat. Then we can talk about which immunizations are due. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Sounds perfect, Doctor. Go right ahead. I'm not afraid of needles, but I appreciate you explaining everything first.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Alright, let's start with your blood pressure. … 128 over 76. That’s looking good. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds regular and strong. Lungs are clear. Everything sounds good there. Now, let’s take a look at your ears, nose and throat… Ears look clear. Nasal passages are clear. Throat looks clear as well. No signs of infection. Everything seems good so far, Ms. Fornes. Your weight is 114 pounds and your height is 169 centimeters. That puts your BMI at 19.8, which is in the healthy range. Now, let's discuss your immunization history. Do you have a record of your previous vaccinations?
PATIENT: I wish! Not really. I think I had all the usual childhood shots, but honestly, it was a long time ago. And I haven't really kept track of boosters or anything. My old doctor back home never really talked about it much either. So, I’m probably due for a bunch, huh?
DOCTOR: That’s quite common, Ms. Fornes. In that case, we’ll want to get you up to date. Based on your age and assuming you had the standard childhood vaccinations, I recommend a Tdap booster – that protects against tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis – and an annual flu shot. We should also discuss the pneumococcal vaccine, which helps prevent pneumonia, and potentially a shingles vaccine, depending on your history. Do any of those sound familiar, or have you had any of them recently?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, they all sound like things I should have had, but I don’t have a clue if I actually did! Pneumococcal and shingles... those names ring a bell, maybe from TV commercials? But I really couldn’t say. I guess I just assumed my old doctor would have taken care of it if I needed them. What’s the shingles one for, exactly? My neighbor got it a few years ago, and it sounded awful.
DOCTOR: You’re right to be concerned about shingles – it can be quite painful. It’s a reactivation of the chickenpox virus, and it causes a painful rash, usually on one side of the body. The vaccine is very effective at preventing it, and it’s recommended for adults 50 and over. Since we don’t have a record of your previous vaccinations, we’ll go ahead with the Tdap, flu, and pneumococcal vaccine today. We can discuss the shingles vaccine at your next appointment. The flu and pneumococcal vaccines can be given at the same time as the Tdap. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly fine to me, Doctor. If it helps keep me healthy, I’m all for it. Let’s get it done! I trust your judgment. I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I’ll start with the Tdap. It may cause some soreness at the injection site for a day or two, and some mild flu-like symptoms are also possible, but they usually resolve on their own. There you go. Next, we'll do the pneumococcal vaccine. And finally, the flu vaccine. All done. I’ll have the nurse give you a printed information sheet about each vaccine, detailing potential side effects and what to watch for. You should feel a little tired, maybe a bit achy, for the rest of the day. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No, I think you’ve covered everything. I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything so thoroughly, Doctor. It doesn’t hurt too bad, actually. And I feel good knowing I’m protected. When should I come back for a check-up? Or for that shingles shot you mentioned?
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, Ms. Fornes. For the shingles vaccine, we recommend waiting until you’re 50 years old. As for a check-up, let’s schedule one for six months from today, August 2nd, 2026, just to see how you’re doing and address any concerns you may have. We can also talk more about the shingles vaccine then. Does that work for you?
PATIENT: That sounds perfect, Doctor. February 2nd, 2026 works great. Thank you again for everything. You’ve been very helpful and kind. I’ll see you then!
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Fornes. It was a pleasure meeting you. The nurse will be with you shortly to review the vaccine information sheets and schedule your follow-up appointment. Have a wonderful day, and please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns.
PATIENT: It was lovely meeting you too, Doctor! You have a good day as well.
