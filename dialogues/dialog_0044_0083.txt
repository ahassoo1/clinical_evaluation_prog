DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kammer. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Asami. It's a pleasure to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you, Doctor. Asami, you say? Yes, well. My daughter, she told me I should come. Said I need a… a card. A “get well” card. Seems silly, but she worries too much. It’s not like I’m sick sick. Just… feeling a little down, I suppose.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's good of you to come in even if you’re not feeling drastically ill, and it's very thoughtful of your daughter to encourage you to get things checked out. “Feeling down” can mean a lot of things, and it’s always best to explore it. To help me understand what’s going on, could you tell me a bit more about what you mean by “feeling down”?
PATIENT: Well, it's just… everything. Work is work, you know? Boiler room doesn’t exactly fill a man with sunshine. And the wife… well, that didn’t work out, did it? It’s been a few years now. Just… empty sometimes. Not sad, exactly. More like… nothing much happens. I eat, I sleep, I go to work. Repeat. You understand? It's a… a quiet sort of thing.
DOCTOR: I do understand, Mr. Kammer. It sounds like you're experiencing a sense of… a lack of fulfillment, maybe?
PATIENT: Fulfill…ment? Is that what the young people are calling it these days? Sounds fancy. Look, I'm a simple man. I operate boilers. I keep the heat on. I don’t need… fulfill-ment. But, alright, yes. Maybe that’s it. Not much to fulfill, if you catch my drift. Used to have hobbies, a little. Fishing, mostly. Haven’t done that in… a long time. Everything just feels… harder now.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly alright to describe it your own way, Mr. Kammer. "Harder" is a good word. And it sounds like you've experienced a loss of things you used to enjoy, which can certainly contribute to feeling this way. Now, has this feeling been gradual, or did something specific happen that made you start feeling like this?
PATIENT: Gradual, mostly. Like a slow leak in a pipe. You don’t notice it at first, then one day, everything is damp. The divorce… that didn’t help, of course. That was… a while back now. Seven years, I think. Eight? It all blurs together after a while. But even before that, things just… lost their shine. Work was always work, but it used to be… I don’t know… less heavy, maybe?
DOCTOR: That makes sense, Mr. Kammer. Significant life changes like a divorce can definitely have a lasting impact, even years later. And it sounds like there was a shift at work, too. Let’s talk a little bit more about your day-to-day life. Besides work, what does a typical week look like for you?
PATIENT: Not much, Doctor. Really. I get up, have some coffee. Go to work. Come home. Watch some television. Eat dinner. Go to bed. Maybe talk to my daughter on the phone. She worries. Always asking if I'm eating enough vegetables. Weekends are the same, mostly. I clean a little. Sometimes I’ll go to the store. That’s about it. I used to see some friends, but… people move on, you know? Don't see them anymore. It’s just… quiet.
DOCTOR: It sounds like you’ve settled into a fairly routine life, Mr. Kammer. A quiet life, as you said. And it’s understandable that losing contact with friends would add to that feeling of… isolation. Now, I’m going to ask you some questions that may seem a little personal, but they’re important for me to get a complete picture of your health. Have you noticed any changes in your sleep or appetite recently?
PATIENT: Sleep’s… alright. I sleep. Not deeply, maybe. Wake up a few times during the night. Nothing major. Appetite… same thing. I eat. Don’t really enjoy it much, but I eat enough to keep going. My daughter worries about that too. She sends me those… those health food things. Quinoa, is it? I don’t know. It all tastes the same to me, really.
DOCTOR: That’s good that you're able to sleep, even if it's not the most restful sleep. And it's also good you're maintaining your appetite, even if the enjoyment isn't there. Now, have you noticed any feelings of hopelessness or sadness, or have you been losing interest in things you used to enjoy?
PATIENT: Hopelessness? No. Not exactly. Just… empty. Like a glass that’s been drained. Sadness… sometimes. When I think about the wife, or… old times. But it doesn’t last. I don’t go around crying all the time, if that’s what you’re asking. Losing interest… yes. Everything feels… pointless, I suppose. Fishing… I haven’t even thought about fishing in months. Used to love that. Now… what’s the point?
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Kammer. That feeling of things being pointless can be very draining. Now, sometimes physical symptoms can accompany these feelings as well. Have you noticed any unexplained aches, pains, headaches, or digestive issues lately?
PATIENT: Well, my back aches. Always has, from the boiler room. It’s just… part of the job, you know? Headaches… sometimes. Not bad ones. Just… tension, I guess. Digestive… no. Everything goes in and comes out, if you’ll pardon the expression. Nothing different there. It’s just… old age, probably. Things start to creak and groan, like an old ship.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear. It sounds like you've been managing your aches and pains and are otherwise physically doing okay. Now, just to complete the picture, do you have any medical conditions, like high blood pressure or diabetes?
PATIENT: High blood pressure. Doctor told me years ago. I take a pill for it. Every morning. That's all. No diabetes, no nothing else. Just the high blood pressure. Been taking the pill for… I don't know… fifteen years? Twenty? It all blurs together. Doctor always tells me to watch my salt, but… what’s the point?
DOCTOR: Okay, so you're managing your high blood pressure with medication, which is good. I see. Now, are you currently taking any other medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Just the pill for the blood pressure. And sometimes, my daughter gives me those… those fish oil capsules. Says they’re good for my brain. I take them to keep her happy. Don't know if they do anything, really. I swallow them with my coffee, that's all.
DOCTOR: Okay, so just the blood pressure medication and occasional fish oil capsules. Good to know. Now, I'm going to ask you a few questions about your family history, if you don’t mind. Has anyone in your family – parents, siblings, or close relatives – experienced depression, anxiety, or other mental health conditions?
PATIENT: Depression… Hmm. My mother… she was always a quiet woman. Kept to herself a lot. My daughter says that was… depression, maybe? But back in her day, they didn't talk about such things. My father was… a strong man. Didn’t show much emotion, ever. No one really talked about feelings in my family. Just… kept things bottled up, if you catch my drift. So, I don't know if anyone was officially… depressed. Just… quiet.
DOCTOR: That's understandable. Mental health wasn’t discussed as openly in previous generations. It sounds like there might be a family tendency towards keeping feelings to oneself. Now, I’m going to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. Just to get a baseline. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and do a quick neurological assessment. It won't take long. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Alright. Sounds sensible. I suppose. As long as it doesn’t take too long. I got things to do, you know. Not much, but… things. Go ahead. I’ll sit here.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Kammer. It won't take long. Blood pressure is 142 over 88. A little elevated, but not significantly different from what you’ve likely been told before. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear. Reflexes are normal. Muscle strength is good on all limbs. No obvious neurological deficits. Everything appears physically normal, Mr. Kammer. This doesn’t rule anything out, of course, but it’s good to have a baseline.
PATIENT: Well. That's… reassuring, I suppose. Always good to know things aren’t falling apart, even if they feel like it sometimes. So. What now? You gonna give me a card?
DOCTOR: Not a "get well" card, Mr. Kammer, but I do want to discuss what's going on. Based on what you've told me – the persistent feeling of emptiness, the loss of interest in activities, the routine lifestyle, and your family history – it sounds like you might be experiencing symptoms of depression. Now, I want to be clear: I'm not making a definitive diagnosis right now. But it’s something we need to explore further. There are several options. We could do some blood work to rule out any underlying medical conditions that might be contributing to your symptoms. We could also consider a referral to a therapist or counselor. Therapy can be very helpful in processing difficult emotions and developing coping strategies. What are your thoughts on that?
PATIENT: Therapy? Counselors? Sounds… fancy. And expensive, probably. I don't need someone telling me how to feel. I just… feel this way. Always have, more or less. Blood work… alright. That doesn't sound so bad. I suppose it can't hurt. But no fancy talking. I’m a simple man, Doctor. I don’t need… help. Just… a little quiet, maybe.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Kammer. And I respect that. No pressure at all for therapy if you’re not comfortable with it. Okay, let's start with the blood work. I’ll order a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a thyroid test. These tests will help rule out any underlying medical causes for your symptoms. I’ll also include a Vitamin D level, as deficiencies can sometimes contribute to mood changes. Once we have the results, we can discuss them and see if any further steps are needed. In the meantime, I'd like to suggest a few small things, if you’re open to it. Things like trying to incorporate a little more physical activity into your day, even just a short walk, and making sure you're eating a balanced diet. Small steps can sometimes make a big difference. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Walking… I can manage that, I suppose. Used to walk a lot, when I was fishing. Balanced diet… I eat. Mostly. As long as it doesn't involve quinoa. And I don’t have to talk to anyone. Fine. Order the blood work. Let's get this over with. And no fancy cards, alright?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Kammer. No fancy cards. Okay, I've ordered the blood work. You can go to the lab at [Lab Name and Address]. You don’t need an appointment. Just tell them Dr. Asami sent you. The results usually take a few days to come back. My office will call you when they're available. In the meantime, please don’t hesitate to call if you experience any significant changes in your symptoms or if you have any concerns. And remember, even small steps are progress. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No. I think that’s all. Just… thank you, Doctor. I suppose. Don’t expect any miracles, alright? I’m just… an old man.
DOCTOR: It was a pleasure meeting you, Mr. Kammer. And you shouldn’t expect any miracles, and I don't. I'm just here to help you feel the best you can. Take care, and I’ll see you when the results are back. .
