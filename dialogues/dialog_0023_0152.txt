DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Geho. I’m Dr. Versace. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, the nurse told me it was about my cholesterol. It was high on my blood test, she said. I don’t really know what that means high, exactly. Just that it wasn’t a good number.
DOCTOR: Yes, I see here your recent lab results did indicate an elevated cholesterol level. "High" simply means the amount of cholesterol in your blood is above the recommended guidelines. Now, there are different types of cholesterol, and it’s important to understand those. Do you have any history of heart problems, or has a doctor ever discussed cholesterol with you before?
PATIENT: Hmm... not really. My family… my mother had some trouble with her legs when she got older, the doctor said it was circulation. But no one ever said anything about cholesterol specifically. I’ve had regular checkups, but they didn’t mention it. I mostly just try to eat healthy and stay active, you know? Is this something serious?
DOCTOR: While your attempts at a healthy lifestyle are commendable, Ms. Geho, unfortunately, diet and exercise aren't always enough. Elevated cholesterol can be serious, as it contributes to plaque buildup in your arteries, increasing your risk of heart attack and stroke. Let's get a more detailed history. First, can you describe a typical day's diet for me?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That doesn’t sound good at all. Okay, let me think. A typical day... Well, breakfast is usually oatmeal with some fruit. Lunch, sometimes a sandwich, maybe a salad. I try to have vegetables with dinner, usually chicken or fish. I do like cheese though, a little bit with my salad or sometimes before bed. And I have a small piece of dark chocolate most nights. Is that bad? I heard dark chocolate was good for you.
DOCTOR: Oatmeal and fruit for breakfast is good. Chicken or fish is excellent. The sandwich... what kind of fillings and bread are we talking about?
PATIENT: Oh, the sandwich… it varies. Sometimes turkey and Swiss on wheat. Sometimes ham and cheese, maybe with lettuce and tomato. Occasionally I get a roast beef one. I like a good rye bread, or sometimes a whole-wheat roll. I don’t eat a ton of sandwiches, honestly, maybe three or four times a week? Does the type of bread matter? I always thought whole wheat was best.
DOCTOR: While whole wheat is preferable to white bread, Ms. Geho, it's the overall fat content – particularly saturated and trans fats – that we need to consider. And the cheese… Swiss, ham…these contribute to the issue. Now, regarding your dark chocolate, a small amount can have some benefits, but it's easy to overdo it. Let’s move on. Do you engage in any regular physical activity?
PATIENT: Yes, I do! I walk most days, usually for about 45 minutes. Sometimes I go a little longer if the weather is nice. I also have a little garden, so there’s some bending and lifting involved in that. It’s not exactly a gym workout, but it keeps me moving. I enjoy it, anyway. Is walking enough? I see people running all the time, is that better?
DOCTOR: Walking is a good start, Ms. Geho, but its effectiveness depends on the intensity. A brisk walk, where your breathing is noticeably elevated, is more beneficial than a leisurely stroll. As for running…that’s not necessarily required, but it can be more efficient. Now, let’s discuss your family history a bit more in detail. You mentioned your mother had circulation problems. Was this diagnosed with a specific condition, like peripheral artery disease?
PATIENT: Hmm, I'm not sure. She just... her legs swelled up a lot when she got older and it was painful for her to walk. The doctor said it was poor circulation, something about the blood not getting through properly. She never really talked about specifics. She didn’t like going to the doctor much. I don't think they ever gave it a fancy name. I just remember her complaining about the pain. And she wasn’t very healthy in general, I’m afraid. She smoked for years.
DOCTOR: Smoking is certainly a contributing factor to vascular disease, Ms. Geho. Alright. I’m going to perform a brief physical examination now. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and palpate your pulses. Please lie back on the examination table.
PATIENT: Okay. That sounds alright. Is everything looking bad, Doctor? I'm a little worried now. I've always been pretty healthy, I thought.
DOCTOR: Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Blood pressure is slightly elevated, 140/90. Pulses are present but diminished in your ankles, which is not entirely unexpected given your mother’s history. I’m also going to take a quick look at your feet for any signs of poor circulation. Skin color is normal, no obvious signs of injury or infection, but there is some slight coolness to the touch in your feet. We need to get some more comprehensive data. I'm going to order a lipid panel to see a more detailed breakdown of your cholesterol levels and a basic metabolic panel. I'd also like to order an ankle-brachial index to assess blood flow in your legs.
PATIENT: Okay. That sounds… like a lot of tests. Is it serious, Doctor? Should I be really worried? And what does all of that mean? I just want to understand what's going on. Will these tests tell me if I need medicine?
DOCTOR: Ms. Geho, I understand your concern. It is important to investigate this further. These tests will give us a clearer picture of your overall cardiovascular health and help determine the best course of action. Yes, they could indicate whether medication is necessary. However, let's not jump to conclusions. The ABI will tell us if there's significant blockage in the arteries in your legs. The lipid panel will break down your cholesterol levels into HDL, LDL, and triglycerides. These numbers will dictate how aggressively we need to treat this. In the meantime, I recommend continuing your healthy diet and regular walking, but please avoid any strenuous activity until we have the results. We’ll discuss everything in detail once the results are back, and then we can formulate a comprehensive plan. Do you have any allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: No, I don't have any allergies that I know of. Never had a problem with any medicine. And… when will I get the results back? And what do those things mean – HDL, LDL? Is one worse than the other? I hate waiting for test results. It always makes me anxious.
DOCTOR: The lab results typically take 24 to 48 hours to come back. As for your question about HDL and LDL, they are different types of cholesterol. HDL is considered the “good” cholesterol. It helps remove LDL – the “bad” cholesterol – from your arteries. High HDL is desirable. LDL, on the other hand, contributes to plaque buildup, increasing your risk of heart attack and stroke. High LDL is undesirable. Triglycerides are a type of fat in your blood. Elevated triglycerides can also contribute to heart disease. It’s important to understand that these are not isolated numbers. We look at the overall picture, taking into account your age, family history, and lifestyle factors. Don't fixate on a single result. Now, are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter ones, or any herbal supplements?
PATIENT: No, I’m not taking anything at all. Not even vitamins, usually. Just the occasional pain reliever if I have a headache. But that’s… very rare. And is there anything I can do while I’m waiting for the results? Like, should I change my diet now, or stop walking? I feel like I should be doing something.
DOCTOR: No, do not make any drastic changes to your diet or exercise routine at this point. Continuing your current habits is sufficient. Unnecessary changes could complicate the interpretation of the results. I understand your desire to be proactive, Ms. Geho, but it’s best to wait until we have all the data before making any decisions. We'll discuss everything in detail once the results come back and I can formulate a plan tailored to your specific needs. I'll have the nurse schedule a follow-up appointment for you in one week to review the results. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. I guess I'll just… wait. Thank you, Doctor. It’s a little scary, but I appreciate you explaining things. I hope it’s not too bad.
DOCTOR: Very well. The nurse will see you to schedule that follow-up. Try not to worry unnecessarily, Ms. Geho. We’ll address whatever the results indicate. .
