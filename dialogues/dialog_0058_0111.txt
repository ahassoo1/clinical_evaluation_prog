DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Drahota. I’m Dr. Todorovich. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Hmm. Good morning to you as well, Doctor. Honestly, I haven’t the slightest idea why I’m here. My wife insisted. Something about my… complexion? I feel perfectly fine, just a bit tired, naturally. At my age, one is tired. Let’s get this over with, shall we? I have important matters to attend to.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, it's good your wife is looking out for you. Even if you feel okay, sometimes things can change without you noticing right away. And it's always best to be thorough. So, this complexion issue… has your wife mentioned where she’s noticed it?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, women and their observations. She mumbled something about my hands, I believe. And… perhaps my face? It’s all rather vague. I haven’t been examining myself in mirrors lately. Too much to do. Is this going to be a long process? Because I assure you, I do not have time for frivolous examinations.
DOCTOR: Okay. Well, it won't be long, Mr. Drahota, but I do need to take a look. Just a quick visual exam, alright?
PATIENT: Very well. Get it over with. And please, be gentle. My hands are what make my living, you understand. All this bending of iron… it's not easy work.
DOCTOR: Alright, let's take a look. Hmm. I notice some age spots on the backs of your hands, which is very common, especially with sun exposure. Your skin does seem a bit dry overall. And… yes, there's some discoloration on your cheeks. It's subtle, but noticeable. I'm also noticing some redness. Do you spend a lot of time outdoors, Mr. Drahota?
PATIENT: Outdoors? Naturally. I’m a reinforcing iron worker, Doctor. One doesn't build skyscrapers indoors. Sun, rain, whatever the weather. I’ve been doing this for… oh, decades. Too long to remember exactly. And I assure you, I’ve always been careful. As careful as one can be, hauling rebar around all day. It's the fatigue, I tell you. It must be the fatigue. This discoloration… it’s probably nothing.
DOCTOR: Right, reinforcing iron work. That does explain the exposure. While fatigue can certainly contribute to changes in your skin's appearance, the discoloration could be something else. It's important to rule out other possibilities. Have you noticed any itching, burning, or soreness on your face or hands?
PATIENT: Itching? Burning? Good heavens, no. I'm a practical man, Doctor. I don’t concern myself with such… sensitivities. If something hurt, I'd know. And it doesn’t. It simply… looks different. My wife has a rather vivid imagination, you see. Always fussing over things. Honestly, I suspect she’s simply bored. Is there a quicker way to resolve this? Perhaps a cream? Something I can apply and be done with?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Drahota. However, simply applying a cream without knowing the cause of the discoloration wouldn't be responsible. It could be something benign, like sun damage, but it's also important to rule out other possibilities, such as a skin condition or something more serious. To be thorough, I'd like to ask a few more questions about your medical history. Have you ever had any skin conditions before, such as eczema or psoriasis?
PATIENT: Eczema? Psoriasis? Doctor, I've spent my life building things with my hands, not worrying about… ailments. I’ve never had anything of the sort. I eat well, sleep when I can, and work hard. That's my medical history. Simple. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have a schedule to keep. I really must insist… is there no way to simply… expedite this process? A quick diagnosis, a quick solution, and I can be on my way? This is quite disruptive, you understand.
DOCTOR: Mr. Drahota, I understand your time is valuable. But a proper diagnosis requires gathering information, and rushing the process could be detrimental. Since you haven't had any skin conditions before, that’s helpful to know. Have you noticed any changes in your overall health recently?
PATIENT: Changes? At my age, everything is changing, Doctor. Joints ache, energy wanes… it's called getting old. No sudden, dramatic changes. Just… the natural decline. Really, I suspect this is simply a cosmetic issue. My wife has always been rather… particular about appearances. She reads those magazines, you see. Full of nonsense, if you ask me. I'm perfectly healthy for a man of my age. Perfectly. Now, is there anything you can tell me right now? Any reassurance whatsoever? This is becoming quite tedious. .
DOCTOR: Mr. Drahota, I understand your frustration, but I can’t give you a definitive answer without a bit more information. Given your history of sun exposure and the changes you’ve described, it's possible this is simply sun damage. However, to rule out other potential causes, I recommend a skin biopsy. It’s a quick, minimally invasive procedure where we take a small sample of skin to examine under a microscope. It will give us a clear answer and allow me to recommend the best course of treatment. I can schedule that for you today. Would that be alright?
