DOCTOR: Good morning, Carla. I’m Dr. Gorga. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. It’s this itching. It’s been driving me crazy, really. All over, it seems. Not painful, just…itchy. It's been going on for a couple weeks now, I think. Maybe a little longer, honestly. Time gets away from me these days.
DOCTOR: Okay, itching… a couple weeks, all over. Hmm. And is it constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It comes and goes, I’d say. Some days it’s barely noticeable, and other days…well, I just want to scratch my skin off! It’s worse at night, usually. Keeps me up, you know?
DOCTOR: Worse at night, alright. And have you noticed anything with the itching?
PATIENT: Anything with it? Like…what do you mean? Is that a silly question? I just…I’m not sure what you’re asking, exactly. Do you mean like, does it happen when I’m doing something? Or with certain clothes?
DOCTOR: No, no, not silly at all. Sorry, bad phrasing. I mean, have you noticed any rash, bumps, redness…anything visible on your skin along with the itch?
PATIENT: Oh! Visible… No, not really. That's the strange thing. It doesn’t look like anything’s wrong. No bumps, no redness, nothing. Just…itchy skin. That’s why I thought maybe it was something inside me, or something. But I don't know. It’s just…frustrating.
DOCTOR: Alright. No visible rash…okay. And have you tried anything to relieve the itching?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Plenty. Lotions, mostly. Lots of different kinds. Moisturizing lotions, some with aloe, some for sensitive skin…nothing seems to really help for very long. And I tried one of those anti-itch creams, you know, the over-the-counter ones? That helped for like, five minutes, maybe.
DOCTOR: Okay, lotions and creams...not much relief. Let’s see… Do you have any allergies, Carla?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Not that I know of. I used to be allergic to pollen when I was a little girl, but I haven’t had a problem with that in years. I eat all sorts of things, too. I love shellfish, and sometimes I'll have nuts. Never had a reaction to anything, as far as I remember. Does medication count? I take something for my blood pressure, but I’ve been on that for ages.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. And you mentioned something for your blood pressure… What medication is that, and how much do you take?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… it's… lisinopril. Yes, that's it. Lisinopril. And I take… twenty milligrams, I think. Every morning. But I’ve been on it for so long, I honestly can’t remember exactly. My daughter helps me with my pills, sometimes. I haven’t changed anything recently, I promise.
DOCTOR: Okay, lisinopril 20mg. Alright. And are there any other medical problems you have?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me see… Well, my arthritis, of course. It’s in my hands mostly, makes it hard to do things sometimes. And I had a gallbladder removed years ago, but that hasn’t bothered me since the surgery. Oh, and my doctor says my cholesterol is a little high, but it’s not bad enough for medication yet, just watching it. Is that enough?
DOCTOR: Alright, arthritis, gallbladder removal, high cholesterol... Okay. Now, just one more thing before I take a look. Any family history of skin problems?
PATIENT: Hmm. Skin problems… My grandmother, on my mother’s side, she had eczema when she was a little girl, I think. But nobody else, not that I know of. My mother had high blood pressure too, like me, and my father had diabetes. But no skin troubles, really. It's been a long time, you know, hard to remember everything.
DOCTOR: Alright, Carla. Let’s take a look at your skin. Can you please sit up and let me examine your arms and back?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. Whatever you need, Doctor. I’m ready when you are. It’s just… embarrassing, you know? It doesn't look like anything’s wrong! But I appreciate you taking the time to look.
DOCTOR: Hmm… skin appears normal. No visible rash, no hives, no excoriations. It's not warm to the touch, no obvious lesions. Well, physically, everything looks okay. This is… puzzling. It's possible it’s a systemic issue, something internal. Or perhaps a mild allergic reaction to something you haven’t identified yet. Given your history, and the fact that this has been going on for a couple of weeks, I think we should do some bloodwork. Just to rule things out. What do you think?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Bloodwork… I… I don’t really like needles, Doctor. But… if you think it’s necessary, then yes. I want to know what’s going on. I just wish it was something simple! Is it going to be expensive? I… I don’t have insurance, you see.
DOCTOR: I understand. I know bloodwork isn't pleasant, and the cost is a concern, especially without insurance. We'll keep it to the basics, a complete blood count and a metabolic panel – just to check your organ function and rule out common causes. I’ll see if we can get it done at a reasonable rate, and we can discuss payment options with the billing department. We can also look into some over-the-counter antihistamines in the meantime to manage the itching while we wait for the results. Sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh, that… that would be wonderful, Doctor. Thank you. A complete blood count and a panel… and the antihistamines… yes, that sounds much better. And talking to the billing department, that would be a great help. You’re very kind to think of that. It makes me feel a lot better just knowing we’re trying to figure it out. Let's do it. What do I need to do?
DOCTOR: Great. Okay, I’ll write you a requisition for the bloodwork. The lab is just down the hall, and they'll take care of everything. They'll need your ID, of course. And I'll write down a recommendation for an over-the-counter antihistamine – something non-drowsy to start. Now, the results usually take a few days. I’ll have my nurse call you with the results as soon as they come in. In the meantime, if the itching gets severe – if it's disrupting your sleep badly, or if you develop any other symptoms, like fever, rash, or swelling – please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: No, I think you’ve covered everything, Doctor. You’ve been very thorough, and you’ve put my mind at ease. Thank you so much for your time and your kindness. The lab down the hall, and the nurse will call… I’ll remember that. And I’ll be careful. I really appreciate it. I’ll let you get back to your other patients. Thank you again. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Carla. Don't hesitate to call if you have any concerns. And remember, if anything changes, go to the emergency room. Have a good day. .
