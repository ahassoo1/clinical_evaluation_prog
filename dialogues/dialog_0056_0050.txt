DOCTOR: Hi Brodie, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Amussen. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It's… this cough. Been botherin’ me for a while now. A dry cough, mostly. Feels like somethin’ ticklin’ the back of my throat, but nothin’ comes up. Hard to explain, really. It’s just… persistent. I don't rightly remember when it started, to be honest. A long time, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, a persistent dry cough… that’s good to know. And you said it feels like a tickle in the back of your throat?
PATIENT: Yes, that's it exactly. A tickle. And sometimes… sometimes it feels a little tight in my chest, but not always. It doesn’t hurt, exactly, just… uncomfortable. I mostly notice it when I try to lay down flat. Makes it harder to sleep, you know?
DOCTOR: Right, a bit of chest tightness, worse when lying down. Okay. And has anything changed recently that might be causing this?
PATIENT: Changed… hmm. That’s a good question. Let me think… Not that I recall. Everything’s been pretty much the same for… well, for as long as I can remember. I don’t get out much anymore, mostly stay at home. My wife, she… she passed a few years back, and I haven’t been doin’ much since. Doesn’t feel like much changes when you’re on your own, you know? I… I don’t even remember if the cough was worse before or after… Oh dear. It’s all a bit of a blur, really.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s okay if you don’t remember specifics. We can work with what you do recall. So, no new pets, no recent travel, no changes in your home environment… just a consistent cough for a while now. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the cough?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… Let me see… Sometimes I get a little short of breath, but I always figured that was just my age. I get tired easily, but… well, I’m ninety years old! Is that a symptom? I don’t know. I haven't had a fever, and I'm not losing weight. No, I don’t think so. Not that I’ve noticed, anyway. It’s hard to tell these days. I… I used to enjoy gardening, but it’s been a while since I had the energy for that. But that’s probably just… old age, like I said.
DOCTOR: Okay, some shortness of breath and fatigue, but no fever or weight loss. And you mentioned you used to garden, but haven't had the energy lately. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions before, Brodie?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s… a hard question. I saw a doctor a long time ago, when my wife was sick. He gave me some pills for my blood pressure, I think. And something for my… arthritis, maybe? My hands get stiff sometimes. But… I don’t remember much else. It was a long time ago, and honestly, I don’t keep track of those things. I just took what they gave me, and… well, here I am. I don’t know if I’ve ever been told I had anything serious, no. It’s all a bit hazy. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It makes perfect sense, Brodie. It's common to forget details over time. So, you’ve been on medication for blood pressure and arthritis in the past. Do you still take those medications now?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Now that’s a good question. I… I don’t think so. I rummaged through the medicine cabinet a while back, and didn’t see any. But… I can’t be certain. It’s possible I put them somewhere else. Or… maybe they ran out a long time ago and I just never got around to getting more. I live alone, you see. It's easy to lose track of things when you're on your own. I really can't say for sure, Doctor. I apologize. My memory just isn't what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you're not currently taking any medications that you're aware of. And you mentioned living alone after your wife passed. Do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Let me think. I don’t think so. I haven’t had any bad reactions to anything that I recall. My wife used to handle most of the medicine stuff, she always remembered what I could and couldn’t take. I don’t recall ever being allergic to anything… food, or… anything, really. But… I haven’t tried anything new in a long time, to be honest. I mostly eat simple foods. I don’t want to risk upsetting my stomach. But no, I don’t believe I have any allergies. Is that helpful? I feel bad for not being more… specific.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly helpful, Brodie. No known allergies is good to know. Alright, let's do a quick listen to your lungs and check your heart. Then we can talk about what might be going on. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds fine. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. It's been a while since anyone listened to my chest, but… I suppose it can’t hurt. Just let me know if it’s going to be cold. My skin gets sensitive these days.
DOCTOR: Okay, take some deep breaths for me, if you can. In and out… good. Okay. I’m hearing some… wheezing in your lungs, and your breathing sounds a little bit labored. Your heart rate is a bit fast, but that could be from the effort of breathing. Your oxygen saturation is a little low at 92%, which isn't ideal. Now, I'm going to feel your ankles to check for swelling. A little bit of swelling there. Overall, it sounds like you could have some underlying COPD, possibly with a recent exacerbation. It’s a common condition in people who have a history of smoking or exposure to irritants. Do you have a history of smoking?
PATIENT: COPD? Exacerbation? Oh dear. Those are… big words, Doctor. I don't know what those mean. As for smoking… well, yes. A long time ago. When I was younger. I didn’t think much of it then, but… everyone smoked back then, you see? It was… common. I quit a long time ago, though. Decades ago. I don’t even remember the last time I had a cigarette. Could that be causing this, even after all this time? I feel bad now, thinking about it. Maybe that's why my wife… well, never mind. I'm just an old man. It’s probably too late to worry about it now, isn't it?
DOCTOR: It's never too late to address health concerns, Brodie. And it’s good you quit smoking – that’s the most important thing you could have done. COPD stands for Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease, and it’s a condition that makes it hard to breathe. It's often caused by smoking, but it can also be caused by other things. Even though you quit a long time ago, the damage from smoking can still affect your lungs. The exacerbation means your symptoms are currently worse than usual, likely due to some inflammation in your lungs. Given your age, history of smoking, and current symptoms, I suspect this is contributing to what you're experiencing. Now, to get a better picture of what’s going on, I’d like to order a chest X-ray to see what your lungs look like. Would that be okay with you?
PATIENT: A chest X-ray… well, I suppose so. If you think it’s necessary, Doctor. I haven't had one of those in… goodness, I don't even remember. I trust your judgment. I just… I don't like being poked and prodded. And I don’t want to cause any trouble. Is it expensive? I don't have much money, you see. I haven’t been working since my wife… passed. I just want to feel better, that's all. It’s hard to breathe sometimes, and I get tired easily. I just want to be able to… sit comfortably without coughing. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: It's absolutely not too much to ask, Brodie. And I understand your concerns about cost and being poked and prodded. The X-ray will help us rule out other potential causes for your symptoms, like pneumonia or fluid buildup in your lungs. As for cost, since you are uninsured, the hospital has financial assistance programs available. We can absolutely work with them to see if you qualify for a reduced rate or even coverage. We won't proceed with anything you can't afford. The X-ray itself is relatively quick and painless. You’ll just stand in front of a machine for a few seconds. And don’t worry, it doesn’t require any poking or prodding. I'm also going to order a blood test to check your oxygen and carbon dioxide levels, as well as a basic metabolic panel to assess your overall health. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Blood tests and… financial assistance? Oh dear. This is all a bit overwhelming. But… alright. If you think it’s necessary, Doctor, I suppose I have no choice. I just want to get this sorted out, so I can breathe easier. Blood tests… I don’t like needles, you know. But… if it helps, I’ll try to be brave. And the financial assistance… that would be a blessing. I really appreciate you looking into that for me. I just… I worry about the bills. I don’t want to be a burden. So, X-ray and blood tests… and then what? Will you tell me what's wrong, after you get the results? I just want to understand what’s happening, and what we can do about it. I'm just an old man, Doctor. I just want to be comfortable.
DOCTOR: You’re not a burden, Brodie, and you deserve to be comfortable. I completely understand your concerns, and we will take things one step at a time. After the X-ray and blood tests, we’ll get the results back, usually within a day or two. Then, we’ll discuss them together. I will explain everything in plain language, so you understand what’s happening and what our options are. Based on your symptoms and history, it’s likely we’ll be looking at managing your COPD. This often involves medications like inhalers to help you breathe easier, and possibly pulmonary rehabilitation to improve your lung function. We will also discuss lifestyle changes you can make to help manage your condition. I'll also ask you about your current medications and diet and lifestyle. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Inhalers… and rehabilitation… It all sounds very complicated, Doctor. But… alright. If you think it’s the best course of action, I’ll trust your judgment. I just want to be able to breathe again, without coughing and wheezing. You said medications and lifestyle changes… Can you tell me more about those? What kind of changes would I need to make? I haven’t been very active since my wife… well, never mind. And the inhalers… Are they expensive? I worry about the bills, you see. I really appreciate you explaining everything so clearly, Doctor. It helps to know what’s going on. I just… I get so confused sometimes. It’s hard to remember everything.
DOCTOR: You’re absolutely right to ask questions, Brodie. It is a lot to take in. Inhalers are usually relatively affordable, especially with assistance programs. We can explore options like generics or patient assistance programs to reduce the cost. They deliver medication directly to your lungs, helping to open your airways and make it easier to breathe. Lifestyle changes will focus on things like quitting smoking , avoiding irritants like dust and fumes, and staying as active as you can. We’ll start slowly, with gentle exercises. The goal is to improve your lung function and overall strength. And pulmonary rehabilitation involves working with a respiratory therapist who will teach you specific breathing techniques and exercises to help you manage your condition. I'm going to send a nurse in to draw your blood now. And I’ll give you a referral to radiology for the chest X-ray. We’ll schedule it for as soon as possible.
