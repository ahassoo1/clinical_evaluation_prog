DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Yadao. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Lorana Stilaire. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. It's nice to meet you as well. Well, it's my waterworks, you see. I'm having a bit of trouble... getting things going, if you know what I mean. It’s been a few weeks now, and it’s a little worrisome.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Yadao. Difficulty with urination can certainly be concerning, and it’s good you came in to have it checked. When you say “trouble getting things going,” could you describe that a little more specifically?
PATIENT: Well, it takes me a good while to actually start peeing. I stand there, and stand there… and nothing. Then, when it finally does come, it’s… weak. Not a strong stream like it used to be. And it feels like I don’t empty everything out, either. Does that make sense? I always have to go back again pretty soon after.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Ms. Yadao. Thank you for explaining that so clearly. So, it takes you some time to initiate urination, the stream is weaker than usual, and you feel a sense of incomplete emptying, leading you to urinate frequently. Has this developed gradually, or did it come on suddenly?
PATIENT: Gradually, definitely gradually. It wasn't one day I suddenly couldn't go. It just… got worse and worse over maybe the last month or so. At first, I just thought it was because I was drinking less water, but I've been trying to drink plenty, and it hasn't really helped.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Yadao. I see here you’ve had regular check-ups with Dr. Evans previously. I also note your age and that you're insured through Medicare. Now, have you noticed any pain or burning sensation while urinating?
PATIENT: No, no pain at all. Not burning, not stinging, nothing like that. Just… difficult. And frustrating, honestly. It's a little embarrassing to even talk about, but it's been bothering me enough that I needed to get it checked. I just didn't know what to do.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly understandable to feel that way, Ms. Yadao. Many people experience similar issues, and there’s no need to be embarrassed. We're here to help. Now, are you experiencing any other symptoms alongside this difficulty with urination?
PATIENT: Hmm... let me think. No fever, no chills. Not tired any more than usual, I suppose. I have been getting up a couple of times at night to pee, maybe two or three times. I usually only had to go once, if that. It’s not a huge amount each time, but enough to bother me, you know? It interrupts my sleep.
DOCTOR: Thank you. That’s helpful information, Ms. Yadao. So, increased frequency during the day and nocturia – needing to wake up at night to urinate – along with difficulty initiating and maintaining a stream, and a feeling of incomplete emptying. Now, have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits recently?
PATIENT: Changes in my... oh, you mean, like, going to the bathroom for that? Well, yes, actually. I’ve been a bit more…constipated lately. Not terribly so, but definitely not as regular as I used to be. It's been a few weeks now, maybe around the same time as the waterworks problem. I thought it was just old age catching up with me!
DOCTOR: That’s good you mentioned that, Ms. Yadao. Constipation can sometimes contribute to urinary symptoms. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions, such as diabetes, high blood pressure, or any other illnesses that you’re aware of?
PATIENT: Well, Dr. Evans always said my blood pressure was a little high, but he put me on a small pill for it years ago, and it's been fine ever since. I don't have diabetes, no. And I haven't had anything major, not really. Just the usual aches and pains for someone my age, you know. A bit of arthritis in my knees, but that’s all. Oh, and I had my gallbladder out a long time ago, but that was decades ago. Is that important?
DOCTOR: Thank you for that information, Ms. Yadao. Both the hypertension and the gallbladder removal are noted. And yes, the gallbladder removal is good to know. Now, have you had any surgeries other than your gallbladder removed?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No, not really. I broke my wrist when I was a little girl, and they set it, but I don’t think that counts as surgery, does it? And I’ve had a few teeth pulled over the years, but nothing else. No major operations, no. I'm pretty lucky, really, never had much trouble with my health until lately. It’s just… this bothersome waterworks problem and feeling a bit stuffed up, you know?
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Ms. Yadao. No other surgical history. Now, regarding your family history, are there any medical conditions that run in your family, such as kidney problems, prostate issues – if any male relatives have had those – or any other urinary tract problems?
PATIENT: Oh, family history… that’s a hard one. My mother had high blood pressure too, I think. And my father… well, he didn't talk much about his health. I know he had some trouble with his stomach when he got older. And my brother… he had some heart problems, but that was later in life. As for the waterworks… no, I don't remember anyone specifically having trouble with their bladder or anything like that. It's not something we really talked about, if you know what I mean. Old Lithuanian families didn't share much, you see.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Yadao. That’s perfectly alright. Now, just a few more questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: No, never smoked a day in my life. My mother wouldn't allow it! She said it was terrible for your lungs, and I always listened to her. I do enjoy a little glass of wine with dinner sometimes, though. Nothing too much, just a small one. And I used to be a very active gardener, but my knees aren’t what they used to be, so I don't get out there as much anymore.
DOCTOR: Thank you. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Just that little pill for my blood pressure, Lisinopril, I think it’s called. And sometimes I take a little something for my arthritis, Ibuprofen, when my knees are really acting up. Nothing else. I try to avoid taking too many pills, you know? I don’t like the way they make me feel. And no vitamins or supplements, no. I try to get my nutrients from my food. Mostly potatoes and beets, you know, Lithuanian food!
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Ms. Yadao. So, Lisinopril for hypertension and Ibuprofen as needed for arthritis. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of. I’ve never had any trouble with anything. I eat everything, I suppose. I've never had a rash or anything like that. I’m pretty lucky, really. I can’t think of a single thing I’m allergic to. I even like cats!
DOCTOR: That's excellent, Ms. Yadao. Thank you for providing me with such a comprehensive history. Now, I’d like to perform a brief physical exam, if that’s alright with you. This will involve listening to your abdomen, checking your blood pressure, and a quick neurological assessment. We may also want to do a simple urine test. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly fine, Doctor. Go right ahead. I trust your judgment. Anything you think is necessary, just let me know. I want to get to the bottom of this waterworks trouble, you see. It’s just… bothersome, and I'd like to feel like myself again. I’m ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you’ll just follow me over to the examination table, we’ll get started. Please lie down on your back, and I'll begin by listening to your abdomen with my stethoscope. Now, can you tell me if you've had any recent changes in your weight?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Actually, I think I might have lost a little weight lately. Not much, maybe a couple of pounds. I haven’t been eating as much, I suppose, with this stomach feeling a bit stuffed up. And I haven’t been as active as usual, you see. It’s not a dramatic change, but I definitely feel a little lighter than I did a few months ago. It’s hard to say exactly how much, because I don't weigh myself very often. It just doesn’t feel as solid, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Yadao. Your abdomen sounds normal, no unusual bruits or tenderness. Now, I’m going to check your vital signs, starting with your blood pressure. 138/82. That’s a little elevated, but consistent with your previous readings. I’ll now check your pulse and temperature. Pulse is 72 and regular, and your temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit. Now, I will perform a quick neurological exam, checking your reflexes and sensation in your lower extremities. Reflexes are intact and sensation is normal bilaterally. Do you feel any numbness or tingling in your legs or feet?
PATIENT: No, no numbness or tingling at all, Doctor. Everything feels perfectly normal down there. My legs feel a little stiff sometimes, you know, from not being as active, but nothing unusual. I can feel everything just fine, and I can move my toes and feet just as well as always. I’m glad to hear everything feels normal, you know. It’s just this waterworks trouble that’s bothering me. It’s just… frustrating, and a little embarrassing, you see?
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Yadao. Now, I'd like to perform a quick digital rectal exam to assess your prostate, just to rule out any enlargement or tenderness. This is a standard part of the evaluation for urinary symptoms in women, and it will provide me with valuable information. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh… a rectal exam? Well, I… I’ve never had one of those before. Is it… necessary? I mean, I’m not having any trouble with… that part. I just have trouble peeing, you see? Is it really going to tell you anything about my waterworks? It sounds… unpleasant.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Ms. Yadao. It's perfectly natural to feel uncomfortable with a rectal exam. It’s not the most pleasant procedure, I agree, but it provides vital information about the prostate and surrounding structures, which can impact bladder function. While you're not experiencing specific symptoms in that area, an enlarged prostate can sometimes press on the urethra and cause difficulty urinating. It’s a quick exam, and it will help us to rule out any underlying causes of your symptoms. We can certainly discuss alternatives if you are strongly opposed, but it would mean we would need to order further, more invasive testing. Would you like me to explain the procedure in a little more detail?
PATIENT: Well… if it really will help figure out what’s going on with my waterworks, I suppose I can do it. But please be gentle, Doctor. And quick, if you don't mind. I really don't like the sound of it. Just explain everything you're doing as you go, okay? And if you find anything… anything at all… just tell me straight away, you hear? No beating around the bush. Alright. Let's get it over with.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Yadao. I will explain everything as I go, and I will be as gentle and quick as possible. It will only take a moment. Now, I'm going to ask you to bend over at the waist, or lie on your side with your knees drawn up towards your chest. Whichever position is most comfortable for you. Once you’re in position, I’ll gently insert a gloved, lubricated finger into your rectum to assess the size and shape of your prostate, and check for any tenderness or abnormalities. I will let you know what I am feeling as I go. Are you ready to proceed?
PATIENT: I… I think so. I suppose it's better to just get it over with. I'll lie on my side, if you don't mind. With my knees drawn up… like this? Just… be quick, Doctor. And gentle, remember.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Yadao. I’m just going to insert my finger gently now… Breathe normally, if you can. I’m assessing the size and shape of your prostate… It feels slightly enlarged, but there are no hard nodules or tenderness. The rectal walls feel smooth, and there is no evidence of masses or bleeding. Okay, I’m finished now. How are you feeling?
PATIENT: Oh… that wasn't as bad as I thought, actually. Still unpleasant, but… not terrible. It's good to hear it didn't find anything hard or tender, you see. Just slightly enlarged… what does that mean, Doctor? Is that the problem? Is my slightly enlarged prostate pressing on my waterworks, making it hard to pee? It is a little uncomfortable, down there.
DOCTOR: It's good to hear it wasn't too uncomfortable, Ms. Yadao. A slightly enlarged prostate is a common finding in men your age. It’s often referred to as Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia, or BPH for short. It’s not cancer, and it doesn't necessarily mean there's anything seriously wrong. However, as the prostate enlarges, it can sometimes press on the urethra – the tube that carries urine from the bladder – which can cause the urinary symptoms you’ve been experiencing – difficulty initiating urination, weak stream, and incomplete emptying. Now, to get a better understanding of the extent of the enlargement and rule out any other potential causes of your symptoms, I'd like to order a few simple tests. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds sensible, Doctor. If a few tests can help figure out what's going on, then go right ahead. What sort of tests are we talking about? Will they be painful? And will they take long? I have a little garden to tend, you see, and I don't want to be stuck in here all day. Just tell me everything, okay? I like to know what I'm getting into.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Yadao. The first test I'd like to order is a urine analysis, or urinalysis. This will check for any infection or other abnormalities in your urine. It’s a simple test, and it doesn’t involve any needles. You’ll just need to provide a urine sample in a cup. The second test is a Prostate-Specific Antigen, or PSA, blood test. This measures the level of PSA in your blood, which is a protein produced by the prostate. An elevated PSA level can sometimes indicate an enlarged prostate, but it can also be elevated for other reasons, so it’s not a definitive diagnosis on its own. This will require a small blood sample from your arm. Both tests are relatively quick and painless. The urine analysis only takes a few minutes, and the blood test will take a little longer – about 10-15 minutes. The lab results usually come back within a few days. Would you like me to schedule these tests for you today?
PATIENT: Yes, please, Doctor. Let's get them scheduled. The sooner we know what's going on, the better. A little needle doesn't bother me, and I can easily provide a urine sample. Just let me know where to go and what I need to do. And if there's anything I need to do to prepare for the tests, just tell me now. I don't want to mess anything up. I’m ready to get this sorted out.
DOCTOR: Excellent, Ms. Yadao. I've scheduled the urine analysis and PSA blood test for tomorrow morning at 8:00 AM at the lab just across the street. There's no special preparation needed for either test. You can eat and drink as normal before the tests. Just bring this requisition form with you. The lab technician will collect the urine sample and the blood sample, and the results will be sent to my office within a few days. Once I have the results, I’ll give you a call to discuss them and develop a treatment plan. In the meantime, you can continue to drink plenty of fluids and try to avoid caffeine and alcohol. And if you experience any fever, chills, or pain while urinating, please contact me immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so, Doctor. You’ve explained everything very clearly. 8:00 AM tomorrow morning, no special preparation… I’ll remember that. Thank you for taking the time to listen to me and figure out what's going on. It’s a relief to finally have a plan. I feel much better already, just knowing what we're going to do next. Hopefully, we can get this waterworks trouble sorted out quickly, and I can get back to tending my garden.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Yadao. I’m glad I could help. I understand your concern, and I’m confident we can find a solution to your urinary symptoms. Don't hesitate to contact my office if you have any questions or concerns before your appointment. We'll be in touch as soon as the lab results are available. Have a good evening and get some rest. And do enjoy your garden when you can. It was a pleasure meeting you.
PATIENT: It was a pleasure meeting you too, Doctor Stilaire. And thank you again for your kindness and patience. I will see you soon, hopefully with some good news. Goodbye! .
