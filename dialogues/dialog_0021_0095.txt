DOCTOR: Alright, Stephane, have a seat. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Honestly, I don't have all day. It's… well, it’s my ear. Or rather, the lack of hearing in one of them. And my face feels… funny. On one side. It just started yesterday. It’s quite inconvenient, really.
DOCTOR: Right. One ear, started yesterday… and “funny” how?
PATIENT: It’s… droopy, I suppose. Not paralyzed, but… noticeably weaker. Like when you try to smile, but one side doesn’t quite cooperate. It’s subtle, but I notice it. And the hearing is just… gone. Completely. No ringing, no buzzing, just… nothing. Is this going to take long? I have a luncheon.
DOCTOR: Well, “subtle” doesn’t usually mean easily diagnosed. We need to figure out why it's happening, and that takes some time. But, alright. Let’s start with a quick look in your ear, and I'll need to do a little neurological exam… just to check things out. Have you had any fever, headache, dizziness, or trouble with your balance?
PATIENT: No fever. No headache, thankfully. And my balance is fine, I walk perfectly normally. I did feel a bit…off, yesterday morning, a little unsteady, but I put that down to not having enough sleep. I’m a widow, you know. It’s… disruptive. Is this exam going to be painful? I really don't have a high tolerance.
DOCTOR: No, it shouldn’t be painful. Just a few quick checks… moving your face, maybe looking at your eyes. It’s to see how the nerves are working. Alright, let’s have you sit up straight and look straight ahead. I’m going to shine a light in each eye… Okay, everything seems… okay. Let’s take a look in your ears now.
PATIENT: Fine. Just get it over with. I have… commitments. And please, be gentle. I detest having things poked at. Honestly, these things are so cold.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Ear canals look clear. Nothing obvious. Look, it could be something simple, like a virus. Sometimes those things just resolve on their own. But given the facial weakness and sudden hearing loss… it’s probably best to get a scan, just to rule out anything serious. Like a… blockage. Or something pressing on the nerve. We’ll need a CT scan. Do you have insurance that will cover that?
PATIENT: Insurance? Goodness, no. My husband… he had a good plan, but, well. It all went with him. I’m… managing. A scan? How much will that cost? I’m not made of money, you know. Honestly, I suspect it’s just a migraine. I get those sometimes, and they do peculiar things. A lot of peculiar things. Are you certain a scan is necessary?
DOCTOR: Look, I understand financial concerns, but sudden hearing loss with facial weakness is not typical of a migraine. It needs to be investigated. A CT scan is the best way to do that. We could try some steroids… they sometimes help with inflammation affecting the nerves, but without knowing the cause… it’s a bit of a gamble. And if it is something more serious, delaying treatment could cause permanent damage. The scan will likely be… several hundred dollars, I’m afraid. We can discuss payment options with the hospital billing department, but I cannot wave a magic wand and make it free. Do you want to consider the steroids, or would you prefer to look into the scan cost?
PATIENT: Steroids? Absolutely not. My sister took those once, and it was a disaster. Bloating, mood swings, the whole nine yards. No, thank you. Look, I suppose… I suppose I can look into the scan. But honestly, the thought of all that paperwork, and the expense… It’s just… overwhelming. I really wish this hadn't happened. What is the chance, really, that it's something serious? A blockage? What does that even mean?
DOCTOR: “Overwhelming” is putting it mildly. Look, a blockage could be anything from fluid to… something more solid pressing on the nerve that controls your face and hearing. The chances… it's difficult to say without the scan. It could be nothing, a temporary issue that resolves on its own, but we cannot simply assume that. Given your age and lack of medical history… it’s less likely to be something catastrophic, but the sudden onset of these symptoms warrants investigation. I can write you a referral to radiology. They can give you a firm price quote before the scan. And we can discuss a payment plan. I’ll also prescribe a course of antiviral medication, just in case it is a viral infection. It won’t cure everything, but it might help with any inflammation. Here are the referral and the prescription. If your symptoms worsen – severe headache, dizziness, double vision – go to the emergency room immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, emergency room, headache, dizziness. I gathered that. Honestly, you’d think a little courtesy wouldn't go amiss. I’m a widow, you know. Dealing with… everything. Fine. Antivirals, scan, emergency room. Let's just get this over with. Thank you… I suppose. Though I can't say I'm particularly reassured.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, get the scan done as soon as possible. And if you have any questions… call the office. Next patient. .
