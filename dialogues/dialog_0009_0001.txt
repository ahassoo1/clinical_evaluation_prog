DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Knoch. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Petrimoulx. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor Petrimoulx. It is a pleasure to meet you too. Well, to put it plainly, I’m here about the smoking. I’ve been… a smoker for a very long time, and I’ve decided it’s time to try and stop. It's become… troublesome.
DOCTOR: Thank you for being so upfront, Mr. Knoch. It takes courage to address something like that. “Troublesome” is a good way to put it, and I commend you for wanting to make a change. To help me understand where you’re starting from, could you tell me a bit more about your smoking history?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Let me see… I began when I was quite young, around fourteen years old, back in Lithuania. It was… common then, almost expected. I used to smoke mostly hand-rolled cigarettes, but when I came to this country, I switched to packaged ones. For many years, it was… one or two a day. Then, during certain stressful periods, it increased. Now? Well, now it's… perhaps a pack and a half a day. I’ve tried to cut back before, a few times, but… it's difficult. Very difficult. I apologize if that is not a precise answer. I do not measure it exactly.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Knoch. An approximate answer is very helpful, and it gives me a good starting point. So, roughly a pack and a half a day currently, after starting around age fourteen. And you've attempted to quit before. That’s good to know – it shows you have motivation and experience with trying. Can you tell me about those attempts?
PATIENT: Yes, well… the first time was after my wife… passed away. It was… a very difficult time, and I thought I should quit for health reasons, mostly. I managed perhaps a week, maybe ten days, but the… the feeling of loss was too strong. I started again. Then, a few years ago, my neighbor, he got very sick from… lung problems. That prompted another attempt. This time I made it almost a month, but I was… terribly irritable. My nerves were shot, you understand? It wasn’t pleasant for anyone. I stopped that attempt quickly. Each time, I tried to go “cold turkey”, if that’s the term. I simply… stopped buying them. I believe that was my mistake.
DOCTOR: "Cold turkey" can be very challenging, especially with a smoking history as long as yours, Mr. Knoch. It sounds like those previous attempts were understandably difficult given the emotional circumstances and the physical withdrawal you experienced. It’s good you're reflecting on what didn’t work before; that’s very insightful. Just to get a full picture, have you noticed any specific symptoms when you try to quit, beyond irritability?
PATIENT: Yes, there were… other things. My concentration was terrible. I couldn’t focus on anything. I found myself… restless. Pacing the floor. And… a strange sort of… emptiness. A craving, naturally, but also a sense of… something missing. It was difficult to explain. And my hands… I always had to be doing something with them. Fidgeting, playing with things, anything. My daughter, she commented on it. Said I looked… anxious. I also found myself… snapping at people, even those I care about. It was not a good experience for anyone involved.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing those details, Mr. Knoch. That gives me a much clearer understanding of what you've experienced during previous attempts. Difficulty concentrating, restlessness, that sense of emptiness, hand fidgeting, increased irritability – those are all common withdrawal symptoms, and it sounds like they were quite disruptive for you. We need to consider all of this as we develop a plan. Before we discuss treatment options, could you tell me about your overall health?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Well, I try to stay active, I walk most days. I live alone, so I do my own gardening, that keeps me busy. I have some… aches and pains, mostly in my lower back, but nothing severe. I haven’t been to a doctor regularly for… some time now. I don’t like hospitals, you see. It reminds me of… bad times. My eyesight is… not what it used to be, I wear glasses. And I have… a bit of a cough, always have, really. Nothing serious, just… a smoker’s cough, I suppose. I’ve never been diagnosed with anything major, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Knoch. That’s helpful to know. Staying active is excellent, and I appreciate you sharing about the aches, vision, and the persistent cough. Given the cough and your smoking history, I would like to listen to your lungs, and perhaps order a chest X-ray to get a baseline image, if you are willing. It’s just a precaution, to rule out anything concerning. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that… sounds reasonable. If you believe it is necessary, I will comply. I do not particularly like the idea, but I understand you are trying to do what is best. A chest X-ray… yes. And listening to my lungs… that is fine as well. I suppose it cannot hurt to be thorough. Is there anything I should do to prepare for these tests?
DOCTOR: That’s very good of you, Mr. Knoch. No special preparation is needed for either test. For the lung exam, you’ll simply need to remove your shirt and take deep breaths as I listen with my stethoscope. The X-ray is quick and painless – you’ll just stand or sit while the technician takes a picture. Let's start with the lung exam now, if you’re comfortable. Afterwards, we can discuss treatment options for quitting, based on your preferences and what we find during the exam.
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, let’s proceed. I’m… not fond of taking my shirt off, but I understand it is necessary. I hope it is not too cold in here. My skin… gets easily chilled.
DOCTOR: Not at all, Mr. Knoch. I have a blanket nearby if you get cold. Alright, just breathe deeply in through your nose and exhale slowly through your mouth. I'm listening to your breathing on both sides now… Deep breath in… and out… Again… Good. Your breathing sounds slightly diminished on both sides, which is not uncommon with a long smoking history. I hear some mild wheezing as well, but nothing alarming at this point. I'm noting this in your chart. Now, let's get that chest X-ray scheduled. Do you have a preferred radiology center, or should I recommend one nearby?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I do not have a preference. Recommend whichever center is most convenient. I suppose… closer is better. I am not a fan of long journeys. And… is it a painful procedure? I have… a low tolerance for discomfort, you see.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Knoch. The closest radiology center is just a short drive away, on Elm Street. It's called "Radiant Imaging." And no, the X-ray itself is not painful at all. You'll simply stand or sit while a technician takes a picture. There's no discomfort involved. It's very quick—a few minutes at most. They'll explain the procedure to you when you arrive. While we're waiting for the X-ray results, let’s discuss some options for quitting smoking. Have you ever considered using nicotine replacement therapy, such as patches, gum, or lozenges?
PATIENT: I have… heard of those things. Patches, I believe my daughter used them once. She was trying to lose weight, as I recall. She said they made her… a little nauseous. I am not keen on putting things on my skin, if I am honest. And gum… I do not care for gum. It gives me a headache. Lozenges… perhaps. But I am worried about the… side effects. I have a sensitive stomach, you see. What other options are available? Perhaps something… less intrusive?
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly reasonable, Mr. Knoch. It’s important to find an option that feels comfortable for you, and to consider your sensitivities. There are non-nicotine medications that can help reduce cravings and withdrawal symptoms. Bupropion and Varenicline are two examples. They work differently than nicotine replacement therapy. However, they do have potential side effects, as do all medications. Bupropion can sometimes cause anxiety or insomnia, and Varenicline can, in rare cases, cause changes in mood or behavior. We would need to discuss your medical history in more detail to determine if either of those would be a good fit for you. Another option, which you mentioned, is support groups or counseling. Behavioral therapy can be very effective in helping people change their habits and cope with withdrawal. Would you be interested in learning more about those options?
PATIENT: Counseling… that sounds… less alarming than taking pills. I am not fond of medication, if I am honest. I prefer to… rely on my own strength, if possible. But I do recognize I may need assistance. Behavioral therapy… tell me more. What does that entail? And would it involve… sharing personal information with strangers? I am… a private man.
DOCTOR: That’s completely understandable, Mr. Knoch. Behavioral therapy focuses on identifying the triggers that make you want to smoke, and developing strategies to cope with those triggers. It also helps you build skills to manage cravings and withdrawal symptoms. There are different types of behavioral therapy. Some are done in a group setting, and some are one-on-one with a therapist. If you were to choose a group setting, you would be with other people who are also trying to quit smoking. It's a supportive environment where you can share your experiences and learn from others. However, you are never obligated to share anything you're not comfortable sharing. One-on-one therapy allows for more privacy. You would work directly with a therapist to develop a personalized plan. And, of course, all therapy sessions are confidential. We have a few excellent therapists in the area who specialize in smoking cessation. Would you like me to provide you with a list of their names and contact information?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, a list would be… helpful. I would prefer to… read about their credentials first, before making a decision. And… perhaps a little information about their… approach? Some people are… more direct than others, and I would prefer someone… gentle. I believe that is the best way to describe it. And if possible, someone who speaks clearly. My hearing… isn’t what it used to be, as I mentioned.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Knoch. I understand perfectly. I can print out a list with each therapist's credentials, a brief description of their approach, and contact information. I’ll also include a note about their communication style, if available. Here you are. I’ve highlighted a few therapists who seem to fit your criteria. Take your time reviewing them. In the meantime, let’s revisit the X-ray. It’s scheduled for tomorrow morning at 9:00 AM at Radiant Imaging. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. This is… very helpful. I will review these therapists carefully. And… 9:00 AM tomorrow… yes, that will work. No, I do not believe I have any questions about the X-ray at this moment. Perhaps I will think of something later. I suppose… that concludes our conversation for today? Unless you have anything else you wish to discuss?
DOCTOR: No, Mr. Knoch, I believe that does conclude our conversation for today. I’m glad we were able to discuss your smoking history and explore some options for quitting. Remember, this is a process, and it’s okay to take things at your own pace. I’ll schedule a follow-up appointment for two weeks from today, to review your X-ray results and discuss your progress. Does that work for you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, two weeks from today will work… fine. I appreciate your patience and… understanding. I am not accustomed to speaking so openly about… these things. But I am glad I did. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Knoch. I’m glad you felt comfortable sharing your concerns. Remember, I’m here to support you every step of the way. Please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. Have a good day, Mr. Knoch. And please, take care.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You as well. Good day.
