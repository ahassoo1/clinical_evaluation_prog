DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Meigs. I'm Dr. Press. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It's my back. It's been hurting real bad. It's...well, you see on the paper, right? The cancer? It's the back, and it's not good.
DOCTOR: Yes, I see here you were previously diagnosed with cancer. And this back pain... is this a new pain, or has it been ongoing?
PATIENT: It’s…newer, I think. The cancer pain, that’s different. It’s like a dull ache, always there. But this back pain… this is sharp. Like something is stuck, and when I move… oof. It started maybe a week ago, getting worse each day. I didn’t think much at first, just thought I slept wrong. But it hasn’t gotten better.
DOCTOR: A week ago, sharp pain… and different from the cancer pain you typically experience. Can you point to exactly where it hurts most?
PATIENT: Right here. Mostly right here. And it goes down my leg a little bit, on this side. Not all the way to my foot, but… down the back of my leg. It’s hard to explain. It's… deep.
DOCTOR: Deep pain radiating down the leg. Alright. And does anything relieve the pain?
PATIENT: Hmm… not really. Laying down helps a little, but not much. And… when I take the pills the doctor gave me for the cancer pain, it doesn't touch this. It feels… separate. That’s why I came in. It’s not the usual pain. It’s…scaring me a little.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern. It’s good you came in to be checked. We need to figure out what’s going on. Have you noticed any numbness or tingling in your leg, or any weakness?
PATIENT: No, no numbness. And not really weakness, but it’s hard to… bend over, you know? Like, I can do it, but it hurts a lot. And… sometimes when I stand up from sitting, my leg feels kinda… shaky. Not all the time, but sometimes. Does that make sense? It’s like it needs a minute to… catch up.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes sense. Shaky feeling, difficulty bending... Alright. Now, I’m going to do a quick physical exam of your back, just to get a better feel for things. Could you lie down on the examination table for me, please?
PATIENT: Okay, yes. That’s fine. Is this okay? I don’t want to… make it worse.
DOCTOR: Carefully, yes. Just let me know if anything I do causes you significant pain. I’ll start by just feeling along your spine and checking your range of motion. Please relax as much as you can. Now, can you point to where the pain is most intense right now?
PATIENT: Right… about here. It feels… hot, almost. And it feels like a muscle is… tight. Really tight. If you press here, it hurts. Be careful, please.
DOCTOR: Alright, yes, there’s definitely tenderness here. And I do feel some muscle spasm. Okay, and now slowly bend forward, as far as you comfortably can. I'm watching your movement. And how does that feel?
PATIENT: Oof! That's… not good. It hurts right here. And it feels like something is… pulling. I can’t go any further. It just… stops. It’s not like a regular backache. That was… uncomfortable. Really uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Alright, yes. Limited range of motion and significant pain with forward bending. Now, I'm going to lift your leg straight up. Just let me know if you feel any pain shooting down your leg. We’ll do one side at a time. First, this leg. Any pain with that?
PATIENT: Yes! That’s it, right there! It shoots down my leg, just like before. Not the cancer pain, but the… sharp pain. It's bad. Stop, please. That's enough. It really hurts.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright, stopping immediately. Yes, that reproduces the pain radiating down your leg. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes and sensation in your legs. Just relax, and let me know if you feel anything unusual. And how does that feel?
PATIENT: It felt… normal. Like, just a little tap. Nothing special. Is that good? I don’t really know what to expect, you know? This is all… a little scary.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s good. Your reflexes are normal, and I'm detecting normal sensation in your legs as well. That rules out some more serious nerve issues, which is reassuring. Based on what you’ve told me and the exam findings, it appears you likely have a lumbar disc herniation—a slipped disc in your lower back. It's pressing on a nerve, causing the pain radiating down your leg, which we call sciatica. However, given your history of cancer, we need to be thorough. I’m going to order an MRI of your lumbar spine to confirm the diagnosis and rule out any involvement of the cancer. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: An MRI… okay. Yes, that’s alright. If it helps find out what’s wrong… yes. I just… I don’t want it to be the cancer. That’s my biggest worry. Can the MRI… will it show if the cancer has spread to my back?
DOCTOR: Yes, the MRI will give us a very detailed look at your spine and will help us determine if there is any evidence of cancer involvement. It's good you're being proactive about this. I’ll write the order for the MRI now. It’s best to get it done as soon as possible. Here's the referral form for the MRI. It's at the imaging center downtown. They should contact you to schedule an appointment. In the meantime, I’m going to prescribe you a muscle relaxant and a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug to help manage the pain and inflammation. I also recommend you avoid any heavy lifting or strenuous activity. We’ll review the results of the MRI when they come back and discuss the best course of treatment. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: Okay, muscle relaxant and anti-inflammatory… and no lifting. I can do that. Will the medicine… will it make me sleepy? I need to… well, I need to be able to do things. And how long will it take to get the MRI? I don’t want to wait too long. This is just… a lot to take in.
DOCTOR: Yes, the muscle relaxant can cause some drowsiness, but it varies from person to person. We’ll start with a low dose and see how you tolerate it. If it makes you too sleepy, we can adjust the dosage or switch to a different medication. The imaging center should be able to get you an appointment within the next few days – I’d estimate within 3-5 business days, but you should call them first thing tomorrow to schedule. And frankly, Ms. Meigs, worrying isn’t going to help. Let’s get the MRI done, see what we’re dealing with, and then we can make a plan. I understand you're anxious, but we need to be practical. Are there any other questions I can answer for you at this time?
PATIENT: Okay. 3-5 days… I can do that. I'll call them tomorrow. No… I think that’s everything. Thank you, Doctor. I really appreciate you listening. And… trying to calm me down. It’s just… scary, you know?
DOCTOR: Yes, well, that’s what I’m here for. Get the MRI scheduled, and call my office if you have any problems or if your pain worsens. We'll talk again when the results are in. You may leave now. .
