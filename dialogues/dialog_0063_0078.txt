DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Pitzel. I am Dr. Jules. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Well, to be frank, I feel…stuck. Like I need a bit of a reset, you know? A jumpstart to get things going again. I’m not sure how to explain it properly, but I just don’t have the energy I used to, and things feel…difficult.
DOCTOR: “Stuck,” you say. A rather vague description, I must admit. Difficulties with energy… are we talking physical fatigue, or more of a…mental exhaustion?
PATIENT: Oh, forgive me, Doctor. You are right to ask for clarification. It’s…both, I think. Physically, I tire easily. Simple things, like walking up the stairs, leave me breathless. But it’s also…a weight in my mind. A lack of motivation, perhaps? I find it hard to concentrate, and I’m not enjoying things the way I used to. It’s frustrating, really. I feel like I’m just…going through the motions.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Breathlessness with exertion… and a diminished enjoyment of activities. And this has been occurring for… how long precisely?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… it’s been…gradual, really. But I’d say, properly noticing it, for maybe six months now? Perhaps a little longer. It started slowly, just feeling a bit more tired than usual. But it’s definitely worsened over the last three months, I’d say. It’s becoming…noticeable to my husband as well, which is when I decided to come see you. He’s very observant.
DOCTOR: Six months… worsening over three. Very well. And are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Let me see… not that I’ve consciously noticed, no. My sleep is…okay. Not the best, but I wouldn’t say I’m losing sleep. Appetite is normal, I suppose. No aches or pains, nothing like that. Just…this general feeling of being depleted. It’s hard to describe. I don’t feel sick, exactly, but I don’t feel well, either. Does that make any sense?
DOCTOR: A general feeling…yes, I understand. Often these things are…psychological. However, we must rule out any underlying medical causes. Have you had any recent changes in your life?
PATIENT: Recent changes… well, my daughter just had her first child, which is wonderful, of course! But it is a big adjustment, you know? More responsibility, more travel to help… and I’m trying to be supportive, but it’s certainly added to my schedule. Aside from that… no, not really. Things have been fairly routine. My husband retired last year, so that was a change, but we adjusted to that quite quickly. He’s keeping busy with his garden, which is lovely.
DOCTOR: A new grandchild… certainly a significant life event. And your husband’s retirement… routine adjustments, you say. Let's move on to your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any chronic conditions – diabetes, high blood pressure, heart problems, anything of that nature?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing like that. I’ve always been quite healthy, thankfully. A bit of high cholesterol, which I manage with diet, but that’s it. No surgeries, no major illnesses… I’ve been very lucky, really. I try to eat well and stay active, but… well, as you know, things change. Perhaps this is just age catching up with me? Though I feel rather young for all this, if you don’t mind me saying so. I just turned forty-five last month.
DOCTOR: Forty-five is hardly advanced age, Ms. Pitzel. But it is an age where certain things become more…common. And high cholesterol, even managed with diet, requires monitoring. Any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No allergies, Doctor. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. I’ve only ever needed antibiotics a few times, and over-the-counter pain relievers for headaches. Nothing regular, though. I prefer to avoid medication whenever possible, if you understand. I believe in letting the body heal itself, within reason, of course. I’ve always been careful about what I put into my body.
DOCTOR: A commendable approach, though not always…practical. Very well. Let’s proceed with a brief physical examination. I'd like to listen to your heart and lungs, and perhaps check your blood pressure. Then we'll assess your reflexes and do a quick neurological exam. Is that agreeable?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly agreeable. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgement completely. I'm ready whenever you are. Please, just let me know what I need to do.
DOCTOR: Very well. Please take a deep breath for me… and exhale slowly. Blood pressure is… slightly elevated, 140/90. Not alarming, but warrants attention. Your heart sounds… regular, though a slight murmur is audible. Reflexes are within normal limits. Now, I'd like you to follow my finger with your eyes… look left, right, up, down.
PATIENT: Alright. Left, right, up, down… Is everything alright, Doctor? You seem…concerned. The murmur… is that something serious? I’ve never been told I had a murmur before.
DOCTOR: A murmur is not necessarily serious, Ms. Pitzel. Many people have innocent murmurs that are… harmless. However, given your recent fatigue and slightly elevated blood pressure, it warrants further investigation. I'd like to order a complete blood count, a thyroid panel, and an electrocardiogram to rule out any underlying cardiac issues.
PATIENT: Oh, I see. That sounds…thorough. An electrocardiogram… is that painful? And the blood tests… will I need to fast beforehand? I have a lunch date with my friend tomorrow, and I wouldn’t want to reschedule.
DOCTOR: The electrocardiogram is not painful, Ms. Pitzel. It simply involves placing electrodes on your chest. As for the blood tests, yes, you will need to fast for at least eight hours beforehand. A minor inconvenience, I assure you. I will send the orders to the lab. They will contact you to schedule the appointments. In the meantime, I recommend you try to reduce your stress levels and get adequate rest. We'll review the results in one week. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, one week is perfectly acceptable, Doctor. Thank you. Adequate rest… I suppose I can try. It's just… difficult with everything going on. Thank you for being so thorough, Doctor. I appreciate your attention to this matter. I’ll contact the lab and schedule those appointments right away. Is there anything else I should be doing in the meantime? Any particular symptoms I should be watching for?
DOCTOR: No, Ms. Pitzel. Simply monitor your symptoms. If you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath at rest, or dizziness, seek immediate medical attention. Otherwise, we will discuss the results of the tests next week. Thank you for your patience. You may leave now.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. I will do that. Goodbye.
