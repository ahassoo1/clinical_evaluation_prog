DOCTOR: Hi Clide, good morning. I'm Dr. Condray. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just… this fever. Keeps comin' back. It's botherin' me, ya know? Gets real annoying.
DOCTOR: Okay, a recurring fever. I understand. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Well, it ain't constant. Comes and goes. Lasts a couple days, maybe three, then I'm fine for a week or so, and then bam, it’s back. Usually starts with just feelin’ kinda tired, then chills, and then… well, you know, fever. I check it myself with a thermometer, gets up to around 101, 102 sometimes. Happens mostly at night, too.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. So, it comes and goes, lasts a few days at a time, with breaks in between. Around 101 to 102 when it spikes, and it tends to happen at night. You mentioned feeling tired when it starts. Anything else happen with the fever?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Sometimes a little headache, nothin' terrible. And… oh! My joints ache a bit, kinda like when it's gonna rain, ya know? But not every time. Mostly just the tired, the chills, and the heat. No cough, no… nothin' else really.
DOCTOR: Alright, so tiredness, chills, fever peaking around 101-102, sometimes a headache and joint aches, but no cough or other symptoms. And this has been happening for… how long now?
PATIENT: Oh, jeez. It's been… a while. Maybe three, four months now? It started kinda mild, thought it was just a little bug, but it keeps comin’ back, like I said. That's why I figured I better come see somebody. It’s just… disruptive, ya know? Hard to get things done when you feel like garbage.
DOCTOR: Okay, three to four months of this recurring fever. That definitely warrants a look. Let’s go through some other things to get a better picture. Have you traveled anywhere recently, even just within the country?
PATIENT: Nope. Haven’t left Puerto Rico in… oh, goodness, must be ten years. My wife and I used to go to Florida every winter, but haven’t been in a while. Just stayin’ put these days. Not much for travelin’ anymore.
DOCTOR: Alright, good to know. And do you have any known allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope, not that I know of. Never had a bad reaction to anything, thankfully. Wife gives me penicillin sometimes when I get a cold, and I'm fine with that. Nothing else, really. I don't take much in the way of pills, try to stay natural as much as I can.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. And are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter ones, or herbal supplements?
PATIENT: Nah, just some vitamin C when I feel a cold comin' on, that's about it. I don't like takin' a bunch of stuff if I don't have to. Mostly just try to rest and drink plenty of water. My wife keeps tellin’ me to take somethin’ for my joints, but I don’t bother.
DOCTOR: Alright, so just vitamin C occasionally. Let’s talk a little about your medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you been diagnosed with any health conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Hmm… well, I had a bad back for a while, that's why I am a chiropractor, ya know? Fixed myself up, mostly. High blood pressure a few years back, but I watch my salt and it’s been okay. Nothing else I can think of. Just the usual old man stuff, aches and pains. Wife keeps me goin’ to the doctor for checkups, but they don’t usually find anything.
DOCTOR: Okay, history of back problems as a chiropractor, and high blood pressure that’s currently managed with diet. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Nope, never been under the knife. Lucky that way, I guess. Always figured I’d rather fix things myself if I could. That’s why I got into this business, right? Keep people outta surgery.
DOCTOR: Alright, no surgeries. And what about your family?
PATIENT: Well, my mother had diabetes, and my father… he had heart trouble, I think. It was a long time ago, can't remember exactly. Most of my siblings are still around, healthy as can be, knock on wood. Nothing real serious on either side, not that I recall.
DOCTOR: Okay, family history of diabetes and heart trouble. Now, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Well, I retired a few years back, so I don’t work like I used to. Mostly just putter around the house, help my wife with the garden. We eat pretty healthy, lots of fruits and vegetables. I try to walk a little bit every day, but my joints don't always cooperate. Mostly just a quiet life. I don't drink much, maybe a glass of wine with dinner sometimes. No smokin' or nothin'.
DOCTOR: Alright, a quiet, healthy lifestyle with mostly good habits. That's good to hear. Before we do a quick physical exam, let's just quickly review. You’ve had a recurring fever for about three to four months, peaking around 101-102, often at night, with symptoms like tiredness and sometimes headache and joint aches. No cough or other symptoms. No allergies, no current medications. History of back problems and managed high blood pressure. Family history of diabetes and heart trouble. And a generally healthy lifestyle. Does that sound accurate?
PATIENT: Yeah, that's pretty much it. You got it all. I'm just… tired of feelin' sick all the time. It's slowin' me down, and I wanna get back to helpin' my wife with the garden. She does most of the work now 'cause I’m always feelin’ under the weather. Let's get this sorted out, Doc. I appreciate you listenin'.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Clide. I understand. It's good you came in to get this checked out. Let's do a quick physical exam, just to get a better sense of things. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your temperature again, and feel your lymph nodes. It won't take long. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, alright. Go ahead. Whatever you gotta do. Just wanna get this figured out, ya know? The sooner the better. I'm ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Okay, your temperature is slightly elevated right now. Your heart sounds regular, no murmurs or abnormal rhythms. Lungs are clear, I don’t hear any wheezing or crackles. Your lymph nodes feel normal, no swelling or tenderness. I'm just checking for any signs of infection. Your abdomen is soft, no pain or tenderness. Overall, the physical exam isn't revealing anything definitive, but the recurring fever is still a concern. Given your symptoms and the fact that this has been going on for several months, I'd like to order some blood work to help us figure out what's going on. It'll give us a better look at your overall health and rule out any potential infections or underlying conditions. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Sounds good to me, Doc. Whatever you think is best. Blood work sounds sensible. Get it done, let's see what's goin' on under the hood. I trust your judgment. Just… hope it ain't nothin' serious, ya know? I’m gettin’ kinda tired of bein’ sick.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Clide. We'll get to the bottom of this. I’m ordering a complete blood count , a metabolic panel to check your kidney and liver function, and a few inflammatory markers to see if there’s any evidence of infection or inflammation. The lab should be able to get these results back within a few days. I’ll have the nurse draw the blood for you now. Once we have the results, we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and create a plan. In the meantime, if your fever gets significantly higher, or if you develop any new symptoms, like a rash, severe headache, or shortness of breath, please don't hesitate to contact the office. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, alright. Sounds like a plan. Just gettin' the blood drawn, waitin’ for the results, then see ya again. I can do that. Thank you, Doc. I appreciate you takin’ the time to listen and figure things out. And tell the nurse I'm not real fond of needles, if that's alright.
DOCTOR: Of course, Clide. I'll let the nurse know. She’s very skilled and gentle, and we'll get you through it as quickly and comfortably as possible. We’ll get these results back and see what’s going on. And please, don't hesitate to call if anything changes or if you have any concerns before your follow-up appointment. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood. Is there anything else I can do for you right now?
PATIENT: Nope, that’s it, Doc. I think I'm good. Just waitin' for the nurse now. Thanks again for your help. I’m ready when she is. Let’s get this over with.
DOCTOR: Okay, great. I’ll let her know you’re ready. Thank you for coming in today, Clide.
