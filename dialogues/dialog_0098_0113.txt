DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Segretto. Welcome. I'm Dr. Bombara. It’s nice to meet you. Now, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor… Bombara, was it? Yes, yes. Well, it’s this… going to the bathroom. Seems like all I do is go to the bathroom these days. It’s… frequent. Very frequent. More than it used to be, that’s for sure. My wife keeps telling me I need to get it checked, and honestly, it's a nuisance.
DOCTOR: Alright, frequent urination. I understand. And how long has this been going on, Mr. Segretto?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Time… time slips away, you know? Let me think. It's been… a while. Maybe a few months? Hard to say exactly. Everything just… blends together after a while. I just noticed it getting worse recently, that's all. More trips at night, too. Waking my wife up. Not good.
DOCTOR: I see. A few months, with it getting worse recently, and nighttime trips becoming more frequent. Okay. And can you describe how frequent is frequent?
PATIENT: Frequent… well, it's… a lot. Used to be just a few times a day, normal, you know? Now it feels like every hour or so. Maybe less. And at night… oh, at least two, sometimes three times. Used to sleep right through, solid as a rock. Now? Now I’m up and down like a yo-yo. It's… tiring, frankly. My wife says I'm lucky she doesn't wake me up with a rolling pin.
DOCTOR: Alright, so significantly increased frequency during the day and at night, disrupting your sleep. And you said it’s been progressively worsening. Are you experiencing any pain or burning when you urinate?
PATIENT: Pain? No, no pain. Not exactly. A little… discomfort, maybe? A bit of a strain, sometimes, but no real burning or anything like that. Just feels like… you don't quite get everything out, if you know what I mean. Like there's still a little left in there, even after you've gone. Annoying, that's what it is. Very annoying.
DOCTOR: Okay, no pain or burning, but a feeling of incomplete emptying. And is your urine stream strong and steady, or is it weaker than usual?
PATIENT: Well, now that you mention it… it’s not what it used to be. It's… weaker. Takes a little longer to get going, too. Not a powerful stream like when I was a young man, that’s for sure. Just sort of… dribbles out there. My grandson, little Timmy, could probably make a bigger splash with his water pistol. Honestly, it’s embarrassing.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Segretto, that's helpful information. Weaker stream, takes longer to start, and feeling of incomplete emptying. Now, have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits recently?
PATIENT: Bowel habits? Now you're asking things! What does that have to do with my bladder? Honestly, Doctor, sometimes these questions… But alright, alright. Let me think. No, not really. Pretty much the same as always. A little…irregular sometimes, if I eat something bad, but nothing drastic. Old man problems, you know? Always been that way.
DOCTOR: I understand. Sometimes the bowel and bladder work closely together, so I just needed to ask. Now, are you experiencing any fever, chills, or lower abdominal pain?
PATIENT: Fever? No, no fever. I feel a little tired, maybe, but that’s just old age creeping up on me. Chills, no. And abdominal pain… not really. A little… achy sometimes, but that’s probably just from working in the garden. I still try to keep up with things, you know? Can't let the weeds take over. No, no real pain to speak of.
DOCTOR: Okay. And just to be thorough, Mr. Segretto, do you have any history of diabetes, prostate problems, or any other medical conditions?
PATIENT: Diabetes? No, never been diabetic. My wife makes sure I don’t eat too many sweets, bless her heart. Prostate problems… well, now that you mention it, the doctor did say something about that a few years back. Something about it enlarging with age. But he didn’t say it was anything serious. Just… normal for an old man, he said. And other conditions? I had my gallbladder out years ago, but that's about it. Otherwise, I've been pretty lucky, considering.
DOCTOR: Alright, history of a check-up mentioning prostate enlargement and past gallbladder surgery. And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications… let me think. Just a little pill for my blood pressure, the doctor gave it to me last year. And I take a multivitamin every day, my wife insists. Says I need to keep my strength up. Otherwise, no. I try to stay away from those pills as much as possible. They just make you feel worse, in my experience.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Segretto. I’d like to do a quick physical exam now, if you don't mind. Just checking your abdomen and, with your permission, a brief prostate exam. That will help me get a better understanding of what's going on. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: A prostate exam? Oh, goodness. Well, I suppose so. Never been a fan of those, if I'm being honest. But if you think it's necessary… alright. Just be quick about it, if you could, Doctor. And try to be gentle, if that’s possible. Old man parts aren’t what they used to be, you know?
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Segretto. I’ll be as quick and gentle as possible. Please lie down on the examination table. I’ll start by listening to your abdomen. Your abdomen is soft, and I don't feel any tenderness. Now, I’m going to do a digital rectal exam to assess your prostate. I’ll let you know before I start. Please just relax as much as you can. Okay, Mr. Segretto. Your prostate feels slightly enlarged, but there are no obvious lumps or areas of concern. It wasn't particularly tender, which is good.
PATIENT: Enlarged, you say? Just as I thought. That doctor years ago… always poking and prodding. Well, I'm glad it wasn't anything serious, at least. Still, it's annoying, all this going to the bathroom. Is there anything you can do about it, Doctor? Anything at all? I don't want to have to live with this for the rest of my life.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Segretto. Given your symptoms and the findings of the exam, it sounds like you likely have benign prostatic hyperplasia, or BPH. That’s the enlargement of the prostate, and it’s very common as men age. It can cause the urinary symptoms you've been experiencing. Now, there are several options we can consider. We could start with lifestyle modifications— things like reducing fluid intake before bed, avoiding caffeine and alcohol, and timed voiding, meaning going to the bathroom on a schedule. We can also discuss medication options that can help relax the muscles in your prostate and improve your urine flow. In some cases, surgery might be considered, but we’ll certainly explore less invasive options first. Before we make any decisions, I'd like to order a urinalysis to rule out any infection and a PSA test, which stands for prostate-specific antigen, to get a baseline level. That will help us monitor your prostate health over time. Does that sound like a reasonable plan?
PATIENT: Urinalysis and a… PSA test? More tests? Honestly, Doctor, it feels like I'm spending more time in here than I am at home! But alright, alright. If you think it's necessary. I just want this sorted out, you know? I'm too old for all this fuss. So, less invasive options first, you say? What kind of medications are we talking about? And what about these lifestyle changes? Cutting back on fluids before bed sounds easy enough, but giving up my evening coffee… that’s a tough one. It’s the only thing that keeps me awake during my wife’s bingo nights.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation about more tests, and I assure you, we’ll only order what’s necessary. The urinalysis is quick and easy, and the PSA test is just a blood draw. Now, regarding medications, there are a couple of main types we could consider. Alpha-blockers can help relax the muscles in your prostate and bladder, which can improve urine flow. The other option is 5-alpha reductase inhibitors, which can actually shrink the prostate over time. Both medications have potential side effects, which we would discuss in detail before starting anything. As for lifestyle changes, cutting back on fluids before bed is a good start, and avoiding caffeine and alcohol can definitely help. Timed voiding, meaning going to the bathroom on a regular schedule, even if you don't feel the urge, can also be beneficial. And I understand about the coffee during bingo nights! Perhaps we can start with reducing your intake slightly and see how that goes. We can tailor the changes to fit your lifestyle. I'll order the urinalysis and PSA test now. Once we have the results, we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and create a treatment plan together. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Alright, alright. Sounds… reasonable. Less caffeine, more scheduled bathroom trips, and some blood tests. I can live with that. Just as long as I don't have to give up coffee entirely. And you'll call me when the results are back? My memory isn't what it used to be, so I'd probably forget to call if I waited too long. My wife does a good job of keeping track of things, but she gets tired of reminding me. And one more thing, Doctor… is this something serious? Should I be worried? I don't want to end up in the hospital.
DOCTOR: Of course. I’ll make sure to call you with the results, and I’ll also have my nurse send you a reminder. And to address your concerns, BPH itself isn’t life-threatening, but it can be uncomfortable and disruptive. It rarely leads to serious complications, but if left untreated, it can potentially lead to urinary tract infections or, in rare cases, kidney problems. That's why it's important to get it managed. The blood tests and follow-up appointments will help us monitor your condition and ensure we’re on the right track. We’ll take things one step at a time, Mr. Segretto, and I’ll be with you every step of the way. I'll have the nurse draw the blood now, and we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results when they're available. Do you have any other questions or concerns before we proceed?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything for now, Doctor. You've been very helpful, explaining everything so clearly. My wife will be happy to hear you're keeping an eye on things. She worries a lot. Alright, let's get this blood drawn, then. Hopefully, it won’t take too long. I have a garden to tend to, you know. The weeds don't wait for anyone. Thank you again, Doctor. I appreciate your time.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Segretto. I’m glad I could help. And don’t worry about the garden—we’ll get this sorted out so you can get back to tending to it. The nurse will be right in to draw your blood. Have a good day, Mr. Segretto. And please, don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns.
