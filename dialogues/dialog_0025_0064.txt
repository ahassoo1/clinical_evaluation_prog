DOCTOR: Well, good morning, Sherion. I'm Dr. Fourney. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It's... my chest. It hurts. Not all the time, but it been happening for a few days now. Like... a heavy feeling, you know?
DOCTOR: Hmm. A heavy feeling, okay. Can you tell me more about that?
PATIENT: It's hard to explain. Not like a sharp pain, more... like someone sitting on my chest. Sometimes it goes up to my shoulder too, the left one. It happens when I walk a lot, I think. Or when I get… excited. Like, if my grandkids come over, running around. It goes away when I rest. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It does, yes. That's helpful. And how long exactly has this been going on?
PATIENT: Let me think… about a week, maybe a little more? I noticed it first when I was helping my daughter move some boxes. She got a new apartment. Heavy boxes! And then it happened again when the grandkids were visiting last weekend. So, maybe eight days? I’m pretty sure. I remember because that was right after the parade.
DOCTOR: Okay, about eight days. And you said it's brought on by activity – walking, excitement… anything else seem to trigger it?
PATIENT: Hmm... not really. Sometimes if I eat a big meal, but not always. And...cold weather maybe? Yesterday it was chilly, and I felt it a little bit when I went to the store. But mostly it's the walking or when I get… worked up. Like happy worked up, with the grandkids. It's strange. Not a bad pain, just… uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, have you ever had chest pain like this before?
PATIENT: No, never. Not like this. I had a bad flu a few years ago, and my chest felt tight then, but that was different. It was… all over, you know? This is just… right here. This is new. I haven't felt this before.
DOCTOR: Okay. And, just to get a good picture, do you have any other symptoms along with this chest discomfort?
PATIENT: No, not really. I get a little… breathless sometimes, but I always have when I walk fast. It’s just… old age, probably! Nothing with the chest pain, though. No dizzy spells, no sweating, no… I don't know… feeling sick to my stomach. Just the heavy feeling in my chest. And a little tired sometimes, but who isn’t?
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, let's talk a little bit about your medical history. Do you have any medical conditions, like high blood pressure, diabetes, high cholesterol...anything like that?
PATIENT: Hmm... well, the doctor told me my blood pressure was a little high last year, so he gave me a pill for it. I take it every day. And… I had a little bit of sugar in my pee once, a long time ago, but he said it was okay, just to watch what I eat. Other than that… no, nothing much. I’m pretty healthy for my age, I think. My husband, he had the cholesterol thing, but I didn't.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you're on medication for high blood pressure. Do you remember the name of that medication?
PATIENT: Let me think… it's a little white pill… Dr. Ramirez, he prescribed it. It starts with an "A", I think. Am… Amlodipine? Is that right? Yes, I think it’s Amlodipine. I take one every morning with my breakfast.
DOCTOR: Good. Amlodipine. And, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No, never. I had all my babies the normal way, but no C-sections or anything fancy. I broke my wrist when I was a little girl, falling from a tree, but that was a long time ago. Just that. Never been in the hospital overnight, thankfully. I always try to stay out of doctors' offices when I can!
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, what about your family?
PATIENT: My mother, she had a heart problem when she was older. They said it was… something with the valves? She was in the hospital a few times for that. My father, he was healthy as a horse until the very end. He smoked, though. A lot of cigarettes. My husband’s side… his brother had diabetes, I think. But other than that, we’re a pretty healthy family, all things considered.
DOCTOR: Okay. And, do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, no! Heavens, no. Never touched a cigarette in my life. My mother didn't allow it. And I only have a little glass of wine sometimes, with dinner. Very little. And definitely no… other things. Just the wine, occasionally. Not even every week.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, are you allergic to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm... let me think. I think I got a little rash when I took penicillin as a child, a long, long time ago. But other than that, no. No food allergies, no bee stings, nothing. I can eat anything, thankfully. My daughter is allergic to shellfish, but I'm not.
DOCTOR: Okay. Well, that gives me a good starting point. Let’s do a quick physical exam, if you don’t mind. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and feel your chest. Just to get a better sense of what’s going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you think is best. I trust you, Doctor. Just let me know if it’s going to be cold! My skin gets sensitive these days.
DOCTOR: Excellent. First, I'll check your blood pressure. Okay, your blood pressure is a little elevated today, but not drastically so. Now, let's listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, and your lungs sound clear. Now I'm going to gently feel your chest. No tenderness to palpation. Everything feels normal there.
PATIENT: Okay. That doesn't sound too bad, does it? It's just… uncomfortable. Like a tightness, you know? I was hoping you'd find something… specific. I just want to feel better.
DOCTOR: It's good that the exam didn't reveal anything immediately concerning. However, your symptoms – the chest discomfort brought on by activity, along with your slightly elevated blood pressure – warrant further investigation. Given your age and description, it's important to rule out any potential cardiac issues. I'm going to order an EKG, or electrocardiogram, to check your heart's electrical activity. And I also want to do a blood test to check your cardiac enzymes, just to be safe. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: An… EKG? And blood tests? Oh dear. That sounds… serious. But if that's what you think is best, Doctor, then yes, okay. I trust your judgment. What does the EKG do exactly? Is it painful? I don't like needles much.
DOCTOR: The EKG is a very simple and painless test. It just involves placing some small stickers, or electrodes, on your chest, arms, and legs. These electrodes detect the electrical signals from your heart and record them on a graph. It doesn't involve any needles at all. As for the blood test, yes, that will require a small needle prick, but it's very quick. We'll just need a small sample to check for certain proteins that can indicate if there's been any damage to your heart muscle. It’s a standard procedure, Sherion. We just want to be thorough and rule out anything serious. Do you have any questions about either of these tests before we proceed?
PATIENT: No… I guess not. As long as it doesn’t hurt too much. And it’s quick? My daughter says the phlebotomists here are good. Okay. Let’s do it. Just… tell me what you’re doing, okay? I get nervous easily. And… what if it is something bad?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, I’ll explain everything as we go. And, of course, I’ll be here to discuss the results with you thoroughly. As for what if it is something bad… we’ll cross that bridge when we come to it. If there is an issue, there are many effective treatments available, and we’ll develop a plan together. But right now, let’s focus on getting these tests done and gathering information. The nurse will be in shortly to start the EKG. She’ll explain the procedure in more detail. And I’ll be right here to interpret the results with you as soon as they're available. Do you have any other concerns at all before we begin?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s all for now. Thank you, Doctor. You’re very kind. It's good to know you're listening. I just… don’t like feeling helpless. I'll try to stay calm. When will I know the results?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Sherion. It's important to me that you feel heard and cared for. And you’re not helpless. We’re taking proactive steps to understand what’s going on, and that’s empowering. The EKG results will be available almost immediately. The blood test results usually take a couple of hours. I’ll have the nurse let you know as soon as they’re ready. I’ll then review them with you in detail. In the meantime, if you experience any worsening chest pain, shortness of breath, dizziness, or sweating, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Is there anyone you would like us to contact after the tests?
PATIENT: No, that's alright. My husband is at work. He wouldn't be much help right now. He worries too much. I'll just wait here and try to relax. Thank you again, Doctor. You've been very reassuring. I appreciate it. I guess I'll just wait for the nurse.
