DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Fornes, good to see you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hi Dr. Gorga. Just for my shots, you know, keepin’ up to date. Routine stuff. It’s good to see you too, by the way. Haven’t been in for a while now, I reckon.
DOCTOR: Right, shots... yes. Hmm. Let me just pull up your record here… It says routine, but… it's a bit vague, honestly. When was the last time you had a tetanus booster, do you recall?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Tetanus… You know, I really don’t remember. It’s been… a long time. Probably when my kids were little? They needed theirs and I always bundled everything together. That was… well, a while back now. I honestly couldn't say for sure. Is that bad?
DOCTOR: It's… not ideal, but not necessarily bad. Tetanus protection does wane over time. Okay. And have you had a flu shot recently?
PATIENT: Flu shot… Let me think. Last winter was pretty mild, I don’t think I even thought about getting one. I usually do when it looks like a bad season is comin', but… no, I don’t believe I did. I was mostly workin’ and tryin' to stay warm.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, likely due for both a tetanus booster and a flu shot. Just to be thorough, are you experiencing any fever, chills, body aches, or a cough right now?
PATIENT: Nope, thankfully. Feelin' pretty good, all things considered. Just a little tired, but that's probably the job. Lots of walkin' and climbin' around those sites, you know? No cough or nothin'. Nothing like a cold or the flu, I promise.
DOCTOR: Good. And are you currently taking any medications, or do you have any allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No medications, not regularly. Just ibuprofen now and then for my back, if I really overdo it at work. And allergies… hmm. I'm a little sensitive to bee stings, but that’s about it. Not like an EpiPen-needin’ kind of sensitive, just a really bad swelling.
DOCTOR: Okay, ibuprofen as needed, bee sting sensitivity... not requiring an EpiPen. Alright. Now, just a quick check… Let's take your blood pressure and listen to your heart and lungs, just to be sure everything's okay before we administer the shots. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds good. Whatever you need to do, Dr. Gorga. I trust your judgement. It's always good to be sure.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure's a little elevated, 140/90, but not drastically so. Heart sounds regular, lungs are clear. Everything sounds alright, but we'll keep an eye on that blood pressure. Now, since you're uninsured, I want to be mindful of costs. We can do the tetanus and flu shot today, and I'll also recommend you check with the local health department about resources for managing your blood pressure. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: That sounds perfectly reasonable, Dr. Gorga. I appreciate you thinkin' about the costs, truly. I've been meanin' to look into what the health department offers. I just... keep puttin' it off. My husband, he usually handles that sort of thing. So, yeah, the shots today sounds good. And I'll try to get on that health department thing, I promise.
DOCTOR: Alright. Just a little pinch, Ms. Fornes. First, the flu shot… then the tetanus booster. Try to relax your arm. There you go. All done. Keep that arm moving to prevent soreness. Now, I'll document this in your chart and give you a card with the dates of vaccination.
PATIENT: Ooh, that was a little somethin', but nothin' I can't handle. Thank you, Dr. Gorga. Appreciate your quick work. Okay, flu shot, tetanus… August 2nd, 2025. I'll stick this somewhere safe. Is there anything else I should be lookin' out for, like, side effects or somethin'?
DOCTOR: Mild soreness at the injection site is common, and a low-grade fever is possible for the first 24 hours. If you experience a high fever, severe allergic reaction—difficulty breathing, swelling of the face or throat—seek immediate medical attention. Otherwise, just normal post-vaccine stuff. And again, check with the health department regarding your blood pressure. I'll also give you a handout with some information on managing it. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. You've been very thorough, Dr. Gorga. Thank you so much for takin' care of me. And I really appreciate you rememberin' the health department thing. I best be gettin' back to work, I reckon. Gotta finish up that site before the rain comes.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Fornes. Get back to work safely, and don’t hesitate to call if you have any concerns. Have a good day.
