DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Withycombe. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Solero. It’s nice to meet you. To start, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Well, I been getting… a lot of flushing. Face gets red, neck too. Happens sometimes when I eat, sometimes just… happens. It’s a little worrying, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand. Flushing can certainly be concerning. To help me understand what’s going on, could you describe when this flushing started?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It started… maybe six months ago? Hard to say exactly. It wasn't all the time at first. Just now and then. But it’s been happening more often the last month or so. I remember it started around the time… well, around the time my wife passed.
DOCTOR: I’m very sorry to hear about your wife, Mr. Withycombe. That must be incredibly difficult. Stress and grief can certainly manifest in physical ways. So, this flushing… does it happen with specific foods, or does it seem random?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. It is… hard. Yes, with foods sometimes. Spicy things, definitely. And… red wine. I used to enjoy a glass with dinner, but now… not so much. But it also happens when I’m just… sitting, watching TV. No food, no drink. Just… red face. It’s strange.
DOCTOR: Okay, that gives me a better picture. It sounds like food and drink can be triggers, but it's also happening independently, which is important to note. When the flushing happens, do you experience any other symptoms along with it?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… hmm. Sometimes I feel a little warm, like a hot flash, I think they call it. And my heart… it beats a little faster. Not a lot, but I can feel it. And sometimes… a little dizzy. Not falling down dizzy, just… lightheaded. It doesn't last long, though. Just a few seconds.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Mr. Withycombe. That’s helpful information. Just to clarify, would you say the dizziness happens during the flushing, or shortly after?
PATIENT: During, Doctor. It happens right when my face gets red and I feel warm. Everything just feels… whooshy for a little bit. Then it goes away. Not scary, just… unsettling.
DOCTOR: Okay, “wooshy” is a good way to describe it. And it resolves relatively quickly. Do you have any history of high blood pressure, or has a doctor ever mentioned anything about your heart health?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, never. I've never been told I have high blood pressure. And I haven’t seen a doctor regular for… a long time, to be honest. My wife, she always took care of all that. After she… well, I just haven’t gotten around to it.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Withycombe. It’s very common for things to fall by the wayside after a loss. We can certainly get you back on track with your health. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing at all. I don’t like taking pills if I can avoid it. Always tried to stay healthy on my own. Just… this flushing is new. And worrying.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies, Doctor. Never had one. I can eat anything, thankfully. My wife used to joke I had a cast iron stomach.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. Now, could you tell me a little bit about your family history?
PATIENT: Hmm… family history. My mother, she had… diabetes, I think. And my father, he had… problems with his heart, later in life. But I don’t know much about it, to be honest. They lived back in India, and we didn’t talk about health much. It wasn’t something we did.
DOCTOR: I see. It’s helpful to know even that limited information. Now, just a couple more questions before we do a quick physical exam. Could you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle… Well, I live alone now, in a small house. I used to work as a counselor, but I retired a few years ago. Mostly I just… keep to myself. I walk a little, in the park. I used to garden, but haven’t had the energy lately. I don’t drink much alcohol anymore, not since my wife… and I don't smoke.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Withycombe. That gives me a good overall picture. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I’ll check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and take a look at your skin. It shouldn’t take long. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… good. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgement.
DOCTOR: Okay, great. If you could please have a seat on the table, we’ll start with your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, 148/92. Not drastically high, but something we’ll want to keep an eye on. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear. I notice some mild facial flushing, as you described. No rashes or other visible abnormalities. Okay, thank you. Based on what you've told me, and this quick exam, a few things come to mind. The flushing, along with the warm feeling and dizziness, could be a few things. It could be related to your blood pressure, or possibly something called rosacea, or even a hormonal issue. Given your history, and the recent loss of your wife, we should also rule out anything stress-related. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order some blood tests. These will help us check your hormone levels, kidney function, and rule out any other underlying conditions. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds… sensible. Blood tests, that’s good. Whatever it takes to find out what’s wrong. I just want to feel normal again.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Withycombe. We’ll get to the bottom of this. I'll write you a lab order now. It will include a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, thyroid stimulating hormone, and a few other tests to get a good baseline. You can go to the lab at [Clinic Name] – the address is on the order. They’re open [Days and Times]. Once you have the results, please bring them back to me, and we’ll discuss them. In the meantime, I recommend trying to manage your stress levels. Grief can have a significant impact on your body. Perhaps consider talking to a grief counselor, or engaging in activities you enjoy. Also, while we wait for the results, I’d like you to try avoiding spicy foods, red wine, and caffeine. And drink plenty of water. Does that all make sense?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That makes… perfect sense. Lab tests at [Clinic Name], avoid spicy food and red wine, drink water… and try to manage stress. I can do that. Thank you. Is there… anything else I should be doing? Or anything I should be looking out for?
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, Mr. Withycombe. As for anything else, please monitor your symptoms. If you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath, severe dizziness, or any other concerning symptoms, please go to the emergency room immediately. Don't hesitate. Also, if the flushing becomes significantly worse, or doesn't improve after a week or so of avoiding triggers, please give the clinic a call and let us know. I'll also schedule a follow-up appointment for you in two weeks, once your lab results are back. Does that work for you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Two weeks is… fine. And I’ll remember to go to the emergency room if I have chest pain. I appreciate you telling me that. I think… that’s everything. Thank you for your time, and for listening to me. It’s good to know someone is taking this seriously.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Withycombe. It was my pleasure. I understand how worrying these things can be, and I’m here to help in any way I can. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. Take care of yourself, and I look forward to seeing you in two weeks.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too. .
