DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Schaust. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Chagaris. It's nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Well, it’s… it’s a bit difficult to explain, really. I’ve been feeling weaker, generally. And my eyelids… they’ve been drooping. It's been getting worse over the last few months, I think. It makes me look very tired, and frankly, it's a bit worrying.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's good you came in to get it checked out. Weakness and drooping eyelids – those can have a number of causes, and it's best to figure out what's going on. When you say "weaker," can you describe that a bit more?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Um… it’s not like a sudden thing. It's more… doing things feels harder. Like, carrying groceries upstairs – I used to do it without thinking, now I have to stop and rest halfway. And even just holding things for a long time, my arms get tired quicker. It’s mostly in my arms and legs, I’d say. Not so much in my hands or feet, though. Is that… helpful? I don't really know how to explain it well.
DOCTOR: That is helpful, thank you. It sounds like the weakness is primarily in your larger muscle groups – your arms and legs – and it's a gradual onset, which is important information. And you mentioned it's been worsening over months. Just to clarify, have you noticed any difficulty with specific tasks, like climbing stairs, lifting things, or perhaps getting up from a chair?
PATIENT: Yes, exactly. Climbing stairs is definitely harder, I have to use the railing now, which I didn’t before. And getting up from a chair… sometimes I need to use my arms to push myself up. It's not every time, but more often than it used to be. Lifting things, like boxes, is also… challenging. I find myself avoiding it, to be honest. I don't want to strain myself.
DOCTOR: Okay, that paints a clearer picture. And have you noticed any other symptoms along with the weakness and drooping eyelids?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No, not really. I haven’t had any fever or anything like that. I suppose I have been a bit more tired than usual, but I just assumed that was from… well, life, you know? Divorces are exhausting. I haven’t noticed any pain, no rashes, no dizziness… nothing obvious, anyway. I don’t really know what to look for, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense. It's good you haven't had any fever, dizziness, or pain. The recent divorce is important information as well – stress can certainly contribute to fatigue. Now, let's move on to some other questions, if you don't mind. Have you noticed any changes in your vision, other than the drooping eyelids?
PATIENT: No, not really. My eyesight is… well, it's not great, always has been a bit blurry. I wear glasses, as you can see. But the blurriness hasn’t gotten any worse, I don't think. And I don't have any double vision or anything like that. Just the usual. It's the eyelids dropping that’s the biggest change, really. It makes me blink more often, just to keep things clear.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know about your vision. And you mentioned the eyelids dropping makes you blink more frequently. Have you noticed any difficulty with swallowing or speaking?
PATIENT: No, no difficulty with either, thankfully. I can eat and drink normally, and I don’t have any trouble talking. Though… now that you mention it, sometimes my voice does sound a bit… quieter than usual. But I thought that was just because I haven’t been feeling myself lately. I don’t know if that’s related. It's very subtle, if it is.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear about swallowing and speaking. And the quieter voice is something to keep in mind. Subtle changes can be important. Now, let's talk a little bit about your medical history. Do you have any past medical conditions that you're aware of?
PATIENT: No, not really. I’ve always been quite healthy, to be honest. Had the usual childhood illnesses – measles, mumps, chickenpox – but nothing serious. No major operations, no chronic diseases… I don’t think. I had a bad sprained ankle a few years ago, but that's about it. My family… my mother had high blood pressure, but that’s the only thing I can think of.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to know. No major medical history. And your mother's high blood pressure is something to note. Have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: No, I haven’t. Never needed any, thankfully. Just the sprained ankle, which didn’t require surgery. Just a lot of ice and rest, as I said. I’m not a fan of hospitals, if that makes any difference. So I try to avoid them when I can. It sounds silly, I know.
DOCTOR: It doesn’t sound silly at all. Many people feel that way. And do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else, like foods or pollen?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I can eat anything, and I haven’t had any bad reactions to medications in the past. I don’t take any regular medication at the moment, either. Just the occasional painkiller for a headache, but nothing specific. I’m pretty lucky, in that regard, I suppose. I haven’t been around pollen much recently, to be honest. Mostly indoors.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful. No known allergies or regular medications. Now, let's talk about social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, none of those, thank you. Never smoked a cigarette in my life. I don’t drink alcohol regularly – maybe a glass of wine with dinner occasionally, but that’s it. And I certainly don’t use any recreational drugs. I try to live a fairly healthy lifestyle, all things considered. Perhaps not successfully lately, but I try.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. And finally, regarding your current situation, do you have any significant stressors in your life other than the divorce?
PATIENT: Well, the divorce is the biggest stressor, to be honest. It's been… difficult, settling things, finding a new place to live, just adjusting to being on my own again. I work as a facilities manager, so that can be stressful sometimes, dealing with building issues and tenants. But that’s normal, I suppose. Nothing major beyond that, no. I don’t have any family nearby, which makes things harder, but… I manage. I mostly just try to keep busy.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for being so open with me, Mr. Schaust. That gives me a good understanding of your overall health and situation. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical exam to get a better sense of what’s going on. I’m going to check your vital signs – blood pressure, pulse, temperature – and then do a quick neurological exam, looking at your reflexes, strength, and coordination. And I'll take a closer look at your eyelids and eyes. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly alright, Doctor. Please, go ahead. I trust your judgment. I just want to know what’s causing this, and hopefully, there’s something we can do about it. I’m ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Okay, your blood pressure is 130/80, which is slightly elevated but not concerning. Your pulse is 72 and regular. Temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit, which is normal. Alright, I’m just going to have you look straight ahead. And now look up, down, left, and right. I’m noticing some ptosis in both eyelids, more pronounced on the left side. Your pupils are equal and reactive to light. Extraocular movements are full, though there is some mild difficulty with upward gaze. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes. Just relax your arms. And now, can you squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. I’m trying my best, Doctor. It feels… a little weaker than usual, if that makes sense. It’s hard to explain. It’s not a dramatic difference, but I can definitely feel it. And yes, you’re right, it does feel a bit… more difficult than it used to be. Is that what you're looking for? I just want to be helpful.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Schaust. That’s helpful. I’m noticing some mild weakness in both arms, particularly with extension. Your legs feel slightly weaker as well, though not as pronounced. Your reflexes are normal. Okay. Based on your history and the physical exam, there are a few possibilities we need to consider. The weakness, drooping eyelids, and difficulty with upward gaze suggest a possible neuromuscular issue. There’s a condition called myasthenia gravis, which causes weakness and fatigue that worsens with activity. Another possibility is a vitamin deficiency, such as vitamin D. It's also possible, though less likely given your normal reflexes, that there's a neurological issue at play. To get a better understanding of what's going on, I'd like to order some blood tests. We'll check your vitamin levels, thyroid function, and also run some specific tests for myasthenia gravis. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible, Doctor. Blood tests seem like a good idea. If that’s what you think is best, then please, go ahead. I just want to know what’s causing this, and if there’s something I can do to fix it. I’m happy to do whatever tests you think are necessary. I’ll do my best to be cooperative. And… what does myasthenia gravis mean, exactly? If you don’t mind explaining it, that is. No pressure, of course. I just… I like to understand things.
DOCTOR: Of course, I'm happy to explain. Myasthenia gravis is an autoimmune condition where your immune system mistakenly attacks the connections between your nerves and muscles. This causes weakness and fatigue, and the symptoms often worsen with activity and improve with rest. It's not contagious, and while there's no cure, it can be effectively managed with medication. The blood tests will help us determine if this is the cause of your symptoms, or if something else is going on. I'm going to order a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, vitamin D level, thyroid stimulating hormone, and a specific test called an acetylcholine receptor antibody test, which is used to diagnose myasthenia gravis. You can take this to the lab downstairs. They'll draw some blood, and the results should be available in a few days. Once I have the results, we can discuss them and create a treatment plan. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding strenuous activity and getting plenty of rest. If you notice any significant worsening of your symptoms – difficulty breathing, swallowing, or speaking – please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, I think… that explains everything quite well, Doctor. Thank you for taking the time to explain it so clearly. I will avoid strenuous activity and get plenty of rest, as you suggested. And I will definitely go to the emergency room if anything gets worse. No, I don't think I have any other questions right now. I suppose I should go downstairs and get the blood tests done then. Thank you again, Doctor Chagaris. I appreciate your help. And… I’ll see you when the results are back. I’ll try not to worry too much in the meantime. Although, that might be easier said than done. But I’ll try.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Schaust. It was a pleasure meeting you. Try not to worry too much, and remember, we'll get to the bottom of this. Please call the clinic if you have any concerns before your follow-up appointment. Here's my card with the clinic number. Have a good day, and I’ll see you soon.
PATIENT: .
