DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Gunasekara. I'm Dr. Gonzalezperez. It says here you’re 83 years of age. Welcome to the clinic. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Eighty-three, is it? Feels like yesterday I was… well, never you mind. What brings me in? Honestly, all this fuss. They keep wanting me to do things. Things I don't need. My feet are… feet. They've been feet for a long time. And I don't want anyone poking and prodding at them now. It's just silly.
DOCTOR: I understand your reluctance, Ms. Gunasekara. However, even feet that have “been feet for a long time” can sometimes develop problems that need attention. To properly assess the situation – and reassure you that everything is alright, if that's the case – I do need to ask a few questions. Could you describe what's bothering you about your feet?
PATIENT: Bothering me? Nothing is bothering me, really. That’s the whole point! People make such a to-do over nothing. My daughter, bless her heart, she’s the one who dragged me here. Said I was being “stubborn” and “unrealistic.” Honestly, I think she just likes the doctor. Always did have a thing for men in white coats. But no, my feet are fine. They get me where I need to go, don’t they? That’s all that matters.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, perhaps we can approach this from a different angle. Even if there isn’t pain, sometimes changes in your feet can affect your balance or how you walk. Have you noticed any difficulty with walking recently?
PATIENT: Walking? Oh, goodness, now you're asking a lot. I walk… I suppose I walk about the house. And to the garden, sometimes. It's not as easy as it used to be, of course. Everything's harder when you get… well, you know. But is that a problem? I don’t know. I haven’t fallen or anything. Just… slower, I guess. But everyone gets slower. It's the natural order of things. Are you suggesting I'm falling apart?
DOCTOR: Not at all, Ms. Gunasekara. I simply want to understand how your feet are functioning. Slower walking isn't necessarily a problem, but it’s useful information. Have you noticed any changes in the way your shoes fit?
PATIENT: Shoes? Oh, goodness, now you're asking about shoes. Honestly. They fit. They always fit. I’ve had these particular pair for… well, a long time. They’re comfortable. I don't understand why everyone makes such a fuss about shoes. They're meant to protect your feet, aren't they? As long as they do that, what's the problem? My daughter keeps trying to get me to buy new ones. All those silly, pointed things. I told her, "If it ain't broke, don't fix it." Simple as that.
DOCTOR: Very well. And have you noticed any numbness or tingling in your feet, particularly when you’re resting or walking?
PATIENT: Numbness? Oh, goodness, no. Not that I’ve noticed. Sometimes my feet feel a little… cool, perhaps? But that's just the air conditioning, I suspect. This building is always freezing. You're not trying to tell me I'm sick, are you? Because I assure you, I am perfectly fine. Just… old. There’s a difference. A very big difference.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Gunasekara. I’m not trying to suggest you’re “sick”. I am simply trying to get a complete picture of your overall condition. Now, just to be thorough, have you had any problems with your circulation – swelling in your legs or ankles, perhaps?
PATIENT: Swelling? Well, now that you mention it… my ankles do seem a little… puffy sometimes. But that’s just the heat, surely? It’s been awfully hot lately. And I do enjoy a little salt with my food. Always have. My mother said it was good for the nerves. It’s nothing to worry about. Just old age, and a fondness for properly seasoned food. Honestly, doctors these days... always looking for something to be concerned about. Back in my day…
DOCTOR: Right. And finally, Ms. Gunasekara, have you noticed any changes in the color or texture of your toenails?
PATIENT: Toenails? Oh, goodness. You’re really getting down to particulars now, aren’t you? My toenails? They're... toenails. I paint them occasionally, a nice pale pink. Otherwise, they're just… there. Honestly, I haven't spent much time examining my toenails recently. I have more important things to worry about. Like what I'm going to have for dinner. Are you sure you can't just tell me I'm fine and let me go? This is exhausting.
DOCTOR: Ms. Gunasekara, I appreciate your candor, though it is making a thorough assessment somewhat challenging. Given your age and the concerns you’ve mentioned – the changes in walking speed, the swelling, the long-standing shoe wear – I would like to conduct a brief physical examination of your feet. This will involve checking your circulation, sensation, and the condition of your skin and nails. It’s a standard procedure, and it will help me to determine if any further investigation is necessary. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Oh, now you want to poke and prod? After all this questioning? Honestly. I told you, my feet are fine. Perfectly fine. But, if you must, I suppose you can take a quick look. But don’t go poking around too much. And no cold instruments, if you please. I hate cold instruments. Make it quick, and be gentle. And no diagnosing me with anything serious, understand? I don’t want to hear about arthritis or… or anything like that. It’s a waste of my time, and yours. Just… have a look and tell me I'm perfectly normal, and let me go home.
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Gunasekara. I’ll be as quick and gentle as possible. Please remove your shoes and socks. I’ll start by checking your pulses. Your pulses are present, but somewhat diminished, particularly on your right foot. Now, I'm going to check the sensation in your feet. Can you tell me if you can feel this when I touch you here?
PATIENT: Diminished? What does that mean, diminished? Is that bad? I told you, I have poor circulation. It’s the heat! And a little bit of salt, perhaps. Yes, yes, I can feel that. A little… prickly. But I feel it. See? Perfectly normal. Stop poking, please. It’s making me nervous. Now, can we be done? I have a luncheon appointment, you know. With my friend Esme. We’re discussing the latest scandal at the garden club. Very important business.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Gunasekara. I'm simply completing the examination. I notice some mild thickening of the skin on your feet, and your toenails could benefit from some trimming. These are common findings in older adults. There is some mild swelling, or edema, in both ankles, which is consistent with what you've described and what I've observed. Based on my examination, I don’t believe there is anything acutely concerning. However, given your age, changes in walking speed, and the swelling, I recommend a few things. First, I’d like you to schedule an appointment with a podiatrist to have your toenails trimmed and to discuss appropriate footwear. Second, I recommend elevating your legs for 30 minutes several times a day. Finally, I suggest you limit your salt intake and drink plenty of fluids. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: A podiatrist? Elevate my legs? Limit my salt? Honestly, this is ridiculous. I’ve lived eighty-three years perfectly well without any of that nonsense. A podiatrist? What does a podiatrist even do? My daughter will be thrilled. She’s always trying to get me to do things I don’t want to do. Elevate my legs? Where am I supposed to do that? On the ceiling? And limit my salt? That's asking too much. Honestly, I think I’m perfectly capable of managing my own health. I’ve been doing it for a long time. I appreciate your… concern, but I think I’ll just go home and have a nice cup of tea. And maybe a little something salty with it. Now, if you’ll excuse me… I have luncheon plans to keep.
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Gunasekara. I respect your autonomy. However, I strongly encourage you to reconsider the recommendations. Even small changes can make a significant difference in your quality of life. I will provide you with a written summary of my findings and recommendations. Please, if you experience any worsening of your symptoms – increased pain, redness, swelling, or difficulty walking – please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic. I wish you a pleasant luncheon with your friend Esme. And Ms. Gunasekara, for your own well-being, please consider discussing this with your daughter. She clearly cares about your health. Have a good day.
PATIENT: Yes, yes, very kind. My daughter will be delighted to hear I saw a doctor. She’ll probably make me schedule all sorts of appointments. Honestly, the fuss. Thank you, Doctor. I suppose. But I still think I'm perfectly fine. And don’t you worry about me. I’ve survived a lot worse than a little swelling.
