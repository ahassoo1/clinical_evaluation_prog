DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Buoniconti. It’s a pleasure to meet you. My name is Dr. Lorana Stilaire. Thank you for coming in today. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Stilaire. It’s… a pleasure to meet you as well. I believe I requested… assistance with some paperwork? Something about… future care, perhaps? It’s rather difficult to recall specifics, I’m afraid. I was advised to come speak with someone about it, though. It had to do with making sure my wishes are known, should… well, should something happen.
DOCTOR: Certainly. It sounds as though you’re interested in discussing advance care planning – completing documents such as a living will and durable power of attorney for healthcare. These are very important steps to ensure your preferences are respected should you be unable to communicate them yourself. To ensure I understand your needs fully, could you tell me a little more about what prompted you to seek this consultation today?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, my memory is… not what it once was. A friend—a former colleague, I think—suggested it. She mentioned something about… peace of mind, and avoiding complications for family. I seem to recall a rather unsettling situation with a neighbor a few years back. It involved a lot of disagreement, and… well, it was unpleasant. I believe she thought I should protect myself from a similar outcome. I don’t… recall the details of that situation very clearly either, I’m afraid. It just… sounded wise, at the time. And I suppose it is a good idea, to be prepared.
DOCTOR: That’s very thoughtful of you to consider this, Ms. Buoniconti. It is a wise decision, and it’s perfectly alright that details aren’t crystal clear. We can take things at your pace and focus on ensuring your current wishes are documented. Before we delve into the specifics of those documents, could you tell me a little about your general health?
PATIENT: General health… I… I believe I’m reasonably well. I don’t suffer from any major ailments, as far as I know. I try to eat a balanced diet—though I admit to a fondness for pastries. And I walk when the weather permits. I haven’t been to a doctor regularly in… some time. Perhaps a few years. My divorce… took up a great deal of energy, and I neglected certain things. I do have… mild arthritis in my hands, I suppose. It affects my work occasionally, but it’s manageable. I take over-the-counter pain relievers when needed. Is that sufficient? I feel rather vague about specifics, I apologize.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Buoniconti. Life can certainly be disruptive. And it's common for health maintenance to take a backseat during stressful times. Thank you for sharing that information. To get a better overall picture, could you tell me if you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… I… believe I've always been fortunate in that regard. No known drug allergies, no severe reactions to foods… I recall a slight rash once, years ago, after eating shellfish, but it was mild and fleeting. And I'm not allergic to… pollen, or dust, or anything common like that. I don't have any sensitivities that I'm aware of. No, I don't believe I have any allergies. Though, it’s possible I’m forgetting something. I truly don't recall any significant allergic reactions.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Ms. Buoniconti. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications… let me see. As I mentioned, I occasionally take ibuprofen for the arthritis in my hands, when the pain is particularly bothersome. Nothing regularly, though. And… I believe my friend—the one who suggested this paperwork—recommended a Vitamin D supplement last winter, as I spend a great deal of time indoors while etching. I think I took it for a while, but I… stopped, at some point. I can’t recall the dosage, or even the brand. I just… remember buying it. Is that helpful? I'm truly trying to be thorough, but my memory is… fragmented. Nothing else comes to mind. No prescription medications, no regular vitamins, just the occasional ibuprofen and that fleeting Vitamin D attempt.
DOCTOR: That is very helpful, Ms. Buoniconti. It’s perfectly alright to not have precise details. We can address any gaps as we move forward. Now, I’d like to ask about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any significant medical conditions, such as high blood pressure, diabetes, heart disease, or cancer?
PATIENT: Significant medical conditions… I believe I have always been quite healthy, for the most part. No high blood pressure, as far as I know. No diabetes. I don’t recall ever being diagnosed with heart disease. And thankfully, no cancer. I had… a rather severe bout of the flu several years ago, but that was temporary. And I broke my wrist as a child, but it healed fully. Other than those minor incidents, I don’t believe I have any significant medical history. I’ve always been fortunate in that regard. Though, my mother suffered from glaucoma, if that is relevant. I haven't been tested for it myself. Is that something I should be concerned about?
DOCTOR: That's good to know. And yes, it's certainly worthwhile to mention your mother's glaucoma. It does increase your risk, and we can discuss having your eyes checked as part of your routine care. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or hospitalizations?
PATIENT: Surgeries or hospitalizations… The broken wrist as a child required a cast, so I was briefly hospitalized for observation after it was set. That was… a very long time ago. And I had my tonsils removed when I was a teenager. Other than those two incidents, I don’t believe I’ve ever been hospitalized or undergone any other surgeries. No, I’m quite certain. It’s rather… uneventful, my medical history. Which I am very grateful for, of course. Perhaps that is why I’ve neglected regular check-ups. Nothing ever seemed necessary.
DOCTOR: That's excellent, Ms. Buoniconti. It's understandable to not prioritize regular check-ups when you've been healthy. Now, could you tell me a little bit about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history… My mother… she lived to be eighty-seven, I believe. She suffered from that glaucoma, as I mentioned. And she had… arthritis, later in life. My father… he passed away when I was quite young, from a heart condition, I think. It was… sudden. I don’t recall many specifics. He wasn’t a particularly healthy man, if I remember correctly. And… I have an older brother, but we haven’t spoken in many years. I believe he lives in Mongolia, but I don’t know anything about his health. I’m afraid that is… rather limited information. I wasn’t particularly close to either of my parents, and I haven’t maintained contact with my brother. It’s a rather… fragmented picture, I apologize.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Buoniconti. It's common for family history to be incomplete. You’ve provided valuable information, and we can work with what we have. Now, could you tell me a little about your social history?
PATIENT: Social history… Well, I am divorced, as you know. It was… amicable, but difficult nonetheless. I don’t have any children. I live alone. I dedicate most of my time to my work—etching and engraving, as I mentioned. It’s… a solitary profession. I have a few acquaintances—colleagues, mostly—but I don’t have a large social circle. I don’t smoke. I rarely drink alcohol—perhaps a glass of wine occasionally. And I don’t use any recreational drugs. It’s… a quiet life, Doctor. A rather… isolated one, perhaps. But I find fulfillment in my work. Is that sufficient?
DOCTOR: That is very helpful, Ms. Buoniconti. Thank you for sharing that with me. Now, one final question regarding your background. Have you ever traveled internationally?
PATIENT: Internationally… Yes, I have. I was born and raised in Mongolia, of course. And I lived there for many years after that. I spent some time in Europe—France, specifically—several years ago. It was… a brief stay, for a workshop. And I’ve traveled to various countries for exhibitions—Japan, Canada… mostly for work-related purposes. Nothing particularly extensive, though. It was… a long time ago, for the most part. I haven't been back to Mongolia in many years. It's... complicated. Does that answer your question?
DOCTOR: Yes, that is perfect. Thank you, Ms. Buoniconti. That gives me a very good overall picture of your health background. Now, before we move on to discussing the advance care planning documents, I'd like to do a brief physical exam. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that would be… fine. Though, I must warn you, my complexion is rather… pale, I believe. And my hands are somewhat calloused from my work. But otherwise, I believe I am in… reasonable health. Please proceed.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let’s start with your vital signs. Your blood pressure is 128/76, and your pulse is 72 beats per minute—both within a normal range. Your lungs sound clear. Your heart sounds regular, no murmurs detected. Your throat appears normal. Now, let’s take a look at your hands. As you mentioned, there is some callusing consistent with your profession. Your grip strength is good, but there is some mild stiffness in your finger joints. Your reflexes are normal and your coordination is intact. Overall, your physical exam is unremarkable, with the mild stiffness in your hands being the only notable finding. Everything appears to be within normal limits, Ms. Buoniconti. Now, let's discuss your advance care planning documents. Are you familiar with living wills and durable powers of attorney for healthcare?
PATIENT: I… believe I have a vague recollection of those terms. Something about specifying my wishes, should I become incapacitated? And designating someone to make decisions on my behalf? It was… explained to me briefly, a long time ago. But I confess, the details are… somewhat hazy. I understand the general concept, but I’m not entirely certain of the specifics. Perhaps you could explain it to me again, in simpler terms? It would be… most helpful.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Buoniconti. You are correct in your understanding. A living will – also known as an advance directive – is a document that outlines your wishes regarding medical treatment if you are unable to communicate them yourself. This can include things like whether or not you want life-sustaining treatment, such as a ventilator or feeding tube, if you have a terminal illness or are in a persistent vegetative state. A durable power of attorney for healthcare – sometimes called a healthcare proxy – is a document that designates someone you trust to make medical decisions on your behalf if you are unable to do so. This person will have the authority to speak to your doctors, review your medical records, and make decisions based on your wishes, or what they believe you would want if you were able to communicate them. Essentially, these documents ensure that your preferences are respected and that someone you trust will advocate for you if you are ever in a situation where you cannot speak for yourself. Does that clarify things a bit?
PATIENT: Yes, that is… somewhat clearer, thank you. The designation of a proxy is… reassuring. It is comforting to know that someone would be able to advocate for my wishes. I… I do not have a partner, or any children. My brother… we are not close. I have a few acquaintances, but I’m not certain any of them would be willing—or able—to take on such a responsibility. It is… a difficult situation. Is it possible to designate a professional—perhaps a lawyer—as a proxy? Or is that not permitted? I apologize for asking so many questions. It is simply that I’ve never encountered this before.
DOCTOR: That's a very valid concern, Ms. Buoniconti. You are right to consider the responsibilities involved. While it is possible to designate a lawyer as your healthcare proxy, it's generally recommended to choose someone who knows you well and understands your values and preferences. A lawyer, while competent, may not have the personal connection needed to make the most informed decisions about your care. However, there are other options. If you don't have a close family member or friend who is willing to serve as your proxy, you can consider designating a public guardian or a professional healthcare advocate. We can discuss the pros and cons of each option and help you find someone who is a good fit for your needs. Before we proceed with selecting a proxy, let's discuss your wishes regarding medical treatment. Are there any specific treatments you would want or not want, even if your condition is terminal?
PATIENT: That is… a difficult question, Doctor. I’ve always believed in the sanctity of life, of course. But I also believe in… dignity. I would not want to be kept alive artificially if there was no hope of recovery. Prolonging suffering seems… pointless. I would want to be comfortable, of course. And I would want my pain to be managed adequately. But I would not want to be subjected to aggressive interventions—such as a ventilator or feeding tube—if my quality of life was severely diminished. And I would not want to be resuscitated if my heart stopped beating naturally. I believe that would be… undignified. I realize this is a rather… bleak conversation. But I believe it is important to be honest about my wishes. I do not want to impose a burden on anyone. I simply want to be allowed to pass peacefully, with dignity and respect.
DOCTOR: That is a very thoughtful and courageous way to express your wishes, Ms. Buoniconti. You've clearly given this a great deal of consideration, and it's important for me to document everything carefully. It sounds as though you would not want life-sustaining treatment if you were in a terminal condition with no hope of recovery, and you would prefer to focus on comfort and pain management. You also do not want to be resuscitated if your heart stopped beating naturally. Is that an accurate summary?
PATIENT: Yes, that is… perfectly accurate. Thank you for listening, Doctor. It is… a weight off my shoulders, to have it documented. Perhaps we should discuss the designation of a proxy now? As I mentioned, my brother is… unavailable. And I’m not certain any of my acquaintances would be willing—or capable—of taking on such a responsibility. Do you have any suggestions? Or perhaps a list of professional healthcare advocates that you would recommend? I apologize for asking so many questions. It is simply that I am… unfamiliar with this process.
DOCTOR: You are not imposing at all, Ms. Buoniconti, and it's perfectly alright to ask questions. It's my job to guide you through this process. Fortunately, I do have a list of reputable professional healthcare advocates in the area. These advocates are experienced in making medical decisions on behalf of others and can ensure your wishes are respected. They typically charge an hourly fee for their services, but they can provide valuable support and peace of mind. Before we review the list, would you like me to explain the role of a healthcare advocate in more detail?
PATIENT: Yes, please. That would be most helpful. I confess, I am unfamiliar with the specifics of their duties. What exactly does a healthcare advocate do? Do they attend medical appointments with me? Do they have the authority to access my medical records? And what is the process for selecting one? I apologize for asking so many questions, Doctor. It is simply that I want to be fully informed before making any decisions.
DOCTOR: You are not imposing at all, Ms. Buoniconti. Asking questions is precisely what you should be doing. A healthcare advocate acts as your representative in all medical matters. They can attend medical appointments with you, take notes, and ask questions on your behalf. They also have the authority to access your medical records, with your consent, and communicate with your doctors and other healthcare providers. Their primary role is to ensure your wishes are respected and that you receive the best possible care. They can also help you understand complex medical information and navigate the healthcare system. The process for selecting a healthcare advocate typically involves an initial consultation to discuss your needs and preferences. You can then review their qualifications and experience and decide if they are a good fit for you. Most advocates have a formal agreement outlining their fees and responsibilities. Would you like me to provide you with a more detailed list of questions to ask potential advocates?
PATIENT: Yes, please. That would be most helpful. A list of questions to ask would be… invaluable. I confess, I am not certain what to look for in a qualified advocate. I want someone who is trustworthy, knowledgeable, and compassionate. And someone who is willing to advocate for my wishes, even if it is difficult. Perhaps a list of their qualifications would be helpful as well? Are there any specific certifications or licenses that I should look for? I apologize for asking so many questions, Doctor. It is simply that I want to be certain I am making the right decision.
DOCTOR: You are not imposing at all, Ms. Buoniconti. It is perfectly reasonable to be thorough when selecting someone to represent your healthcare interests. Here is a list of questions to ask potential healthcare advocates. It also includes a list of qualifications to look for. Generally, advocates with a background in nursing, social work, or law are well-equipped to handle these responsibilities. Certification as a professional healthcare advocate is not always required, but it can indicate a higher level of training and expertise. Pay attention to their experience advocating for patients with similar conditions and their communication style. It’s important to find someone who is a good listener and who is willing to advocate for your wishes, even if it is difficult. I also recommend checking their references and verifying their credentials before making a final decision. Do you have any immediate questions about the document?
PATIENT: This is… immensely helpful, thank you. The questions are very thorough, and the list of qualifications is invaluable. I feel much more confident now about selecting an advocate. I believe I will take some time to review the document and contact a few of the advocates on the list. Is there anything else I should be aware of before I begin this process? Any potential pitfalls to avoid? I apologize for asking so many questions, Doctor. I simply want to be certain I am making the right decision.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Buoniconti. And please, don’t apologize for asking questions. It's my job to provide you with all the information you need. One potential pitfall to avoid is selecting an advocate solely based on cost. While it’s important to find someone affordable, it’s even more important to find someone who is qualified, experienced, and trustworthy. Another pitfall is failing to discuss your wishes in detail with the advocate. Make sure they understand your values, preferences, and concerns, and that they are willing to advocate for them, even if it’s difficult. Finally, it’s important to maintain open communication with the advocate throughout the process. Keep them informed of any changes in your health or wishes, and make sure they are available to answer your questions and address your concerns. Overall, selecting a healthcare advocate is an important step in ensuring your wishes are respected. Take your time, do your research, and find someone who you trust and feel comfortable with. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I believe you have answered all of my questions. I am immensely grateful for your time, patience, and guidance. You have alleviated much of my anxiety, and I feel much more confident now about selecting an advocate. Thank you again for everything. I truly appreciate your kindness. .
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Ms. Buonictoni. It was my pleasure to assist you. Please don’t hesitate to contact my office if you have any further questions or concerns in the future. Have a good day, and take care.
