DOCTOR: Hi Kandy, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Amussen. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, it’s my waterworks, really. I’m having a bit of trouble… going. It just takes me ages to start, and sometimes it doesn't feel like I empty everything, you know? It’s been going on for a couple of weeks now.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Trouble starting, a slow stream, and feeling like you don’t fully empty your bladder. That’s definitely something we should look into. A couple of weeks, you said?
PATIENT: Yes, about two weeks, maybe a little longer. It started gradually, not all at once. At first, I thought I just drank too much tea before bed, but it hasn’t gotten any better, even when I cut back. It’s a bit embarrassing to talk about, honestly.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly alright, Kandy. These things happen, and it's much better to talk about it so we can figure out what's going on. No need to be embarrassed at all. Gradual onset is helpful to know. Now, can you tell me a little more about when this happens?
PATIENT: Hmm, when… well, it's mostly when I need to go, of course. But even then, it takes a good minute or two to actually get anything going. And sometimes, I'll feel like I'm finished, get up, and then have to go back a few minutes later because it feels like there's still some left. It's more common in the mornings, I think, but it happens throughout the day. Not usually at night, though – if I wake up to go, it's fine.
DOCTOR: Okay, so mostly when you initiate urination, a delay in starting, incomplete emptying, more common in the mornings… and not usually a problem overnight. That’s helpful. Do you feel any pain or burning while you’re urinating?
PATIENT: No, no pain at all. No burning either. It’s not uncomfortable, exactly… just… frustrating. And like I said, it feels like I have to push a bit more than I used to. It’s more of a weak stream, not a strong one.
DOCTOR: Alright, no pain or burning, just a weak stream and needing to push. Good to know. Have you noticed any changes in your urine itself?
PATIENT: Changes in the urine… let me think. No, not really. It looks the same as always, I think. Normal color, no blood or anything like that. Sometimes it's a bit darker if I haven't had enough to drink, but that's just me being forgetful and needing to drink more water.
DOCTOR: Okay, no changes in the color or appearance of your urine. That's good. Now, let's talk a little bit about your medical history. Do you have any medical conditions that you’re currently being treated for?
PATIENT: Oh, let's see. I have a bit of arthritis in my knees, but that's all managed with some cream and gentle exercise. And my blood pressure gets a little high sometimes, so I take a small pill for that – Lisinopril, I think it's called. Otherwise, I’m pretty healthy for my age. I have Medicare, so I see a doctor regularly for checkups.
DOCTOR: Okay, arthritis and high blood pressure, managed with cream/exercise and Lisinopril. That's good to know. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think… yes, I had my gallbladder removed many years ago. Must be… thirty years or more now. And I had a hysterectomy, a long time ago too, when I was still relatively young. But nothing else, not that I can recall.
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder removal and a hysterectomy. Good to know. And do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, no allergies that I’m aware of. I’ve never had a reaction to any medication, not that I can remember. I eat everything, and I don’t have any problems with pollen or dust or anything like that. I used to worry about bee stings, but I haven't been stung since I was a little girl!
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. That's helpful. Now, I'm going to ask a few questions about your family history. Has anyone in your family had any problems with their bladder or kidneys?
PATIENT: Oh, family history… let me think. My mother had some trouble with her kidneys when she was older, but I don’t know exactly what it was. Something to do with them not working properly. My brother had diabetes, but he took care of it with diet and exercise. And my father… well, he was a healthy man, lived a long life. I don’t remember anyone else having specific problems with their bladder, no.
DOCTOR: Okay, mother with kidney problems, brother with diabetes. That's good to know. Now, let's talk a little bit about your lifestyle. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: Oh no, never. I've never touched a cigarette in my life. My husband, God rest his soul, he used to smoke, but I always made sure he smoked outside. It's a dreadful habit, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, good, you don’t smoke. How about alcohol?
PATIENT: Oh, just a small glass of wine with dinner sometimes. Nothing more than that. I used to enjoy a little more when I was younger, but I don’t drink very often now. Maybe once or twice a week, if that. It’s more of a habit than anything, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, occasional small glass of wine. And finally, do you do any regular exercise?
PATIENT: Well, I try to. I go for a short walk most days, if the weather is nice. And I do some gentle stretches to help with my arthritis. It's not much, but it helps me stay mobile. I used to be very active, but I’m not as young as I used to be.
DOCTOR: Okay, so regular walks and gentle stretching. Thank you, Kandy, that gives me a good overall picture. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright. We’ll just check your abdomen and do a quick neurological exam. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that's perfectly alright. Go ahead, Doctor. I trust your judgment. I'm ready whenever you are.
DOCTOR: Okay, great. First, I’m going to listen to your abdomen with my stethoscope. Just try to relax and breathe normally. Okay, everything sounds normal there. Now, I’m just going to gently press on your abdomen to check for any tenderness. Let me know if anything feels painful. No tenderness there. And finally, I'm going to do a quick neurological exam, just to check your reflexes and sensation. Can you please cross your legs?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Alright, go ahead. I do feel a little silly, but if it helps, that’s what matters.
DOCTOR: Okay, everything seems normal there as well. No obvious neurological deficits. Now, based on what you've told me and the exam, it sounds like you may be experiencing urinary retention, or difficulty fully emptying your bladder, likely due to some weakening of the bladder muscles. It's common as we get older. It could also be related to your history of a hysterectomy, although it's difficult to say for sure without further testing. To get a better understanding of what's going on, I’d like to order a urine analysis to rule out any infection, and a post-void residual volume test to see how much urine is left in your bladder after you urinate. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly reasonable, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. A urine analysis and… a post-void residual volume test, you said? Is that painful? I do worry about tests, you know.
DOCTOR: No, the post-void residual volume test isn’t painful at all. It’s a very simple procedure. After you urinate, we’ll use a small, sterile catheter to gently drain any remaining urine from your bladder and measure the amount. It might feel a little strange, but it shouldn’t hurt. And the urine analysis is just a simple sample. We'll give you a cup, and you’ll provide a sample when you're ready. I'll write the orders for these tests now, and the nurse will let you know how to schedule them. In the meantime, I recommend trying to drink plenty of fluids – about 6-8 glasses of water a day – and avoiding caffeine and alcohol. Also, try to urinate regularly, even if you don’t feel a strong urge. We'll review the results once they’re back, and then we can discuss a plan of action. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds very good, Doctor. Plenty of water, no caffeine, and regular trips to the bathroom… I can manage that. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly. I feel much better knowing what's going on and what we’re going to do about it. I appreciate your kindness.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Kandy. I’m glad I could help. The nurse will be in shortly to go over the test orders and schedule them for you. If you experience any sudden pain or inability to urinate at all, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any other questions for me before I go?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. You’ve been very thorough, Doctor. I really do appreciate it. Thank you again for your time and patience. I'll see you when the test results are back.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Kandy. Take care, and don’t hesitate to call if you have any concerns. .
