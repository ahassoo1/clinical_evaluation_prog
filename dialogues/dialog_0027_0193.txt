DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Mr. Goodstein. Welcome. I'm Dr. Fazzina. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor. It is very nice to meet you too. Well, to be frank, it’s a little embarrassing, but… I have a lot of gas. More than usual, and it’s… disruptive. It started maybe a week ago, I think. It’s just… a lot of it.
DOCTOR: Okay, disruptive gas… I understand. It can be bothersome. A week ago, you said?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. About a week. Maybe a little longer, but I am quite sure it was before the first of August. I try to keep track of these things. It’s… well, it’s hard not to keep track, if you understand what I mean. It happens many times a day, and… it smells. A lot. I apologize for bringing this up.
DOCTOR: No apology necessary, Mr. Goodstein. These things happen, and it’s important to get them checked out. So, it’s been happening frequently for about a week, and you've noticed a… stronger odor than usual?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that is correct. More frequent, and… stronger. It is not a pleasant thing. I eat the same things I always eat, mostly. Sandwiches, soups, sometimes a little pasta. Nothing new, really. I was worried it might be something… serious. I do not want to be a bother, but it is quite upsetting.
DOCTOR: Okay. Nothing new in your diet… That's good to know. And you're not experiencing any other symptoms along with the gas?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No stomach pain, no… changes in my bowel movements, nothing like that. Just… the gas. And the smell. It is mostly just… inconvenient, and I worry about other people. It’s… embarrassing in public, you see. I do not want to cause anyone discomfort.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Goodstein. It’s good that you're not experiencing any pain or changes in your bowel habits. Let’s go over a little bit of your medical history, if you don’t mind. Do you have any known allergies to any medications or foods?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No allergies that I am aware of. I have never had a reaction to anything, as far as I know. I have Medicare, if that is helpful. I get my prescriptions at the pharmacy near the market. I think that is all. I am generally a very healthy person, despite this… situation.
DOCTOR: Good, no known allergies. That's helpful. And you said you're generally healthy… Have you had any significant medical problems in the past?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing significant. I had the flu once, many years ago, but everyone gets the flu. I also broke my arm when I was a child, falling from a tree, but it healed perfectly. Other than that… just the usual colds, I suppose. I try to eat healthy and get enough rest. I do not smoke, and I rarely drink alcohol.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no major medical issues, flu and a childhood broken arm… Have you had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never had surgery. I have always been… lucky, I suppose. I try to avoid doctors if possible, but this… this is a bit difficult to ignore. I am glad I came in to see you. It is just… embarrassing to talk about these things. But you are very kind, Doctor, and I feel more comfortable now.
DOCTOR: I appreciate you saying that, Mr. Goodstein. It's perfectly normal to feel embarrassed discussing these things, but we're here to help. Now, let's talk about your family history, if you don't mind. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… my mother had… problems with her stomach, sometimes. Indigestion, I think. But she did not see a doctor very often. My father was very healthy, lived to be eighty-five. And I do not know much about my grandparents, to be honest. They lived in Hungary, and we did not see them very often. Is that helpful, Doctor? I do not want to waste your time.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly fine, Mr. Goodstein. Any information is helpful. So, mother had some stomach issues, father was healthy… Now, just a couple more questions. Are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No medications at all. I do not like taking pills if I can avoid it. I try to stay as natural as possible. Just vitamins sometimes, a multivitamin. But I have not taken those recently. I prefer to get my nutrients from food. It is better for you, I think.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Goodstein. Let’s just do a quick examination, if you don't mind. I'll listen to your abdomen and check for any tenderness. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That is perfectly alright. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgement. Just… please be gentle? It is a little sensitive, you see. But I understand you need to do your job.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Goodstein. I will be as gentle as possible. Just let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. Okay… I'm not detecting any significant tenderness or masses. Your bowel sounds are present, though they seem a little… active. Everything seems normal on initial examination, but those active bowel sounds could be contributing to the gas.
PATIENT: That is… reassuring, Doctor. So, it is not anything serious? Just… my stomach being too active? Is there anything I can do about that? Perhaps a special diet? I am willing to try anything to make this stop. It is just… very disruptive, as I said. And embarrassing.
DOCTOR: It doesn’t seem to be anything serious at this point, Mr. Goodstein. Often, increased gas is related to diet or how your gut processes food. It could also be a slight imbalance in your gut bacteria. I'm going to recommend a few things. First, let’s try keeping a food diary for a week to see if we can identify any trigger foods. Write down everything you eat and drink, and note when you experience gas. Second, consider limiting gas-producing foods like beans, broccoli, cabbage, onions, and carbonated drinks. Third, over-the-counter simethicone can help relieve gas. Do you know what that is?
PATIENT: A food diary… yes, I can do that. And those foods… beans, broccoli, cabbage… yes, I do eat some of those. I will try to avoid them. And simethicone… is that a pill? I think I have seen that in the store. It is for gas, correct? I will try all of those things, Doctor. I appreciate your help. I feel much better knowing it is not something terrible. I just want to be able to go out in public without… worry.
DOCTOR: Yes, simethicone is a pill, or liquid, available over-the-counter. It helps break up gas bubbles. We'll start with these measures for a week. If the gas doesn't improve, or if it gets worse, or if you develop any other symptoms like abdominal pain, bloating, nausea, vomiting, or changes in bowel habits, please contact me immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I do not think so. You have been very thorough, and I appreciate your kindness. I will keep the food diary, avoid those foods, and try the simethicone. And I will contact you if anything changes. Thank you again for your help. It is a relief to have a plan. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Goodstein. I’m glad I could help. Remember, it’s okay to reach out if you have any concerns. We'll check in after a week to see how things are going. Have a good day, and please don't hesitate to contact the office if you need anything.
