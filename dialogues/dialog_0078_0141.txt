DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Mr. Ferneding. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Solero. It’s a pleasure to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Afternoon, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Well, it’s this itching, really. It’s all over, pretty much. Been going on for…oh, I’d say a couple weeks now, maybe a little longer. It’s driving me a bit mad, to be honest. Not painful, exactly, just… constant.
DOCTOR: I see. Constant itching all over… for a couple of weeks. That certainly sounds frustrating. To get a better understanding, could you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Sure. Hmm… it doesn’t really seem to be worse at any particular time of day. It's just… there. And it doesn’t really seem to be connected to anything I’m eating, as far as I can tell. I haven’t changed my diet recently. It's not like a rash, either. Just… my skin feels like it needs scratching all the time. I’ve been using lotion, a lot of lotion, but it doesn’t really help for long.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it's been constant for a couple of weeks, not linked to a specific time of day or changes in your diet, and lotion isn’t providing much relief. And you haven’t noticed any visible rash, correct?
PATIENT: That’s right. No rash, no bumps, nothing like that. Just the itching. It’s…well, it’s hard to describe. It’s under the skin, almost. Does that make any sense? Like a deep itch, not just on the surface. It’s not a new soap or anything like that, either. I’ve been using the same things for years. I’m a fairly simple man, really. Don't change things much.
DOCTOR: Yes, that does make sense – a deep itch, not superficial. And you haven’t changed any soaps, detergents, or other skincare products recently. That’s helpful information. To get a more complete picture, could you tell me a little about your overall health?
PATIENT: Oh, sure. Well, I'm… fairly healthy for my age, I think. I walk a lot, try to stay active. I had a bit of trouble with my blood pressure a few years back, but it’s been controlled with medication for a long time now. I take… let me think… Lisinopril, I believe it's called. And a baby aspirin every day, the doctor said it’s good for my heart. Otherwise… not much. I had my gallbladder out maybe ten years ago, but that’s about it. I’m on Medicare, if that’s helpful. And… oh, my wife passed away about five years ago. That was… difficult. But that’s about the extent of it. Is there anything specific you’re looking for?
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that with me, Mr. Ferneding. It’s good to know you’re generally active and that your blood pressure is controlled. Lisinopril and a daily aspirin – I’ve made a note of that. And I’m sorry to hear about your wife. Okay, so you take Lisinopril and aspirin, had your gallbladder removed ten years ago, and are on Medicare. No known allergies?
PATIENT: No allergies that I’m aware of. Never had a problem with bee stings or anything like that. Food allergies either. I eat pretty much everything. I used to love shellfish, but I haven't had it in a while. More of a cost thing, to be honest. It's expensive, and… well, it's just me these days. So I don't really bother with fancy things. But no, no allergies, not that I know of. I haven't been around any new plants or anything like that, either.
DOCTOR: Good. No known allergies and no recent exposure to anything new that might be causing a reaction. Now, regarding your family history, are there any skin conditions, or conditions that cause itching, that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. My mother… she had eczema when she was a child, I think. But she grew out of it. And my grandmother, on my father’s side… she had really dry skin. Always complained about it. But it wasn’t really… itching, as much as just… flaking, you know? Neither of them had anything serious, as far as I know. My father… he was a healthy man, lived a long life. And my brother… he’s still alive, thankfully, but we don't talk much anymore. He always was a bit of a loner. I don't know anything about his medical history, to be honest. So… eczema on my mother’s side, dry skin on my grandmother’s. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: That is helpful, thank you. So, eczema in your mother and dry skin in your grandmother. And you haven't had any recent travel or changes in your living situation that might be contributing to this?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. I’ve lived in the same house for almost forty years. And I haven’t been anywhere further than the grocery store in the last year, to be honest. I used to travel a bit with my wife… but that was a long time ago. So, no changes in travel or living situation. Just the same old house, the same old routine, and… this itching. It's really starting to get on my nerves.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds incredibly frustrating. Okay, Mr. Ferneding, with your permission, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. I’ll take a look at your skin, and also listen to your heart and lungs just as a general check. That will help me get a better idea of what might be going on. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly alright, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I’m happy to cooperate. I’m just hoping we can figure out what’s causing this itch. It’s really driving me mad. Go ahead, whenever you’re ready.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you could please loosen your clothing, that would be helpful. I’m going to start by examining your skin. Alright, Mr. Ferneding. I’m not seeing any obvious signs of rash, hives, or anything like that on your skin. Your heart and lungs sound clear. I’m also not feeling any swollen lymph nodes. Your skin feels generally normal to the touch, but I can tell you're experiencing some irritation. It's subtle, but it’s there. Given your history and the exam findings, the itching could be due to a number of things, including dry skin, a mild allergic reaction, or even something systemic. To help narrow down the possibilities, I’d like to order a complete blood count and a comprehensive metabolic panel . These tests will give us a good overview of your overall health and help rule out any underlying medical conditions. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly reasonable, Doctor. Blood tests… I’ve had those before. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. A CBC and a CMP, you said? Will I need to fast for those? And… how long will it take to get the results? I'm just anxious to get this sorted out. It's nice of you to be so thorough.
DOCTOR: Yes, a CBC and a CMP. And yes, you will need to fast for the CMP – that means no food or drinks, except water, for at least 8-12 hours beforehand. I'll give you a requisition form with detailed instructions. The results typically take 24-48 hours to come back. Once I have them, I'll give you a call to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the findings and formulate a plan. In the meantime, I recommend continuing to use a fragrance-free, hypoallergenic lotion several times a day. You can also try taking an over-the-counter antihistamine, like Benadryl or Zyrtec, to help relieve the itching. However, please be aware that some antihistamines can cause drowsiness, so be careful when driving or operating machinery. Does that sound like a good plan for now?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds very good, Doctor. Fasting for 24 hours, hypoallergenic lotion, and an antihistamine… I can do all of that. Benadryl, you said? I think my wife used to take that. I'll be careful about the drowsiness. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly. I appreciate your help. And… thank you for being patient with an old man who just wants to stop itching.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Ferneding. It's my pleasure. And please, don't apologize for wanting to find relief – that’s what I’m here for. Here is the requisition form. The lab is located just down the hall. They are open until 5:00 PM today. Please let the front desk know if you have any trouble locating it. I'll be in touch as soon as the results come back. In the meantime, if the itching becomes significantly worse, or if you develop any other symptoms, such as fever, rash, or difficulty breathing, please don’t hesitate to call the office immediately or go to the nearest emergency room. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so, Doctor. You’ve covered everything very thoroughly. I’ll head down to the lab now and get those tests done. Thank you again for your time and patience. It’s a relief to finally be getting this looked at. I think that will be all for now. Have a good day, Doctor.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Ferneding. You have a good day as well. And please, don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. .
PATIENT: .
