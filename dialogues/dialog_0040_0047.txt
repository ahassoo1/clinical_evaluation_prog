DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Rover, yes?
PATIENT: Yeah, that's me. Cleo Rover. Good to meet ya, Doc… uh, Osga, right? My wife… she used to handle all this kinda stuff. Long-term care… it's somethin' she looked into. I'm just… well, I'm just followin' through now. It's August, isn't it? Feels like time's flyin' by.
DOCTOR: Yes, August 2nd. Look, Mr. Rover, I appreciate you coming in, but my schedule is… tight. Let’s just get straight to why you're here. What’s bothering you?
PATIENT: Botherin' me? Well, nothin’ right now, exactly. It’s… it’s about makin' sure I'm covered, ya know? For the future. My wife… she wanted me to have this insurance, just in case. She said it would help if I needed… help. I'm still pretty good, workin’ steady… movin' freight mostly. But things change, don't they? She just… wanted me prepared. I forget a lot of the details she talked about, though. It was a while back.
DOCTOR: So, preventative care?
PATIENT: Preventative… yeah, I guess that's a good way to put it. She wasn’t one for leavin' things to chance, my wife. Always plannin' ahead. I mostly just… did what she said. She said it was important to have someone look at me… to see if I was… still able. Able to do things, ya know? She worried I’d overdo it at work sometimes. I like stayin' busy. It keeps me goin'. Is this… is this what this is for? Just checkin' if I'm still okay?
DOCTOR: Fine. Let’s start with a basic review. Do you have any current medical problems?
PATIENT: Medical problems… hmm. Well, my back gets a little sore sometimes, from liftin' stuff at work. Been that way for years, nothin' serious. I take some… some pills for it, when it really flares up. Can’t remember what they’re called, though. My wife got 'em for me. Other than that… I get a little tired now and then, but who doesn’t, right? I don't really go to the doctor much. Haven’t needed to, not really. I mostly just… tough it out. Is that what you wanna know?
DOCTOR: And have you had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… let me think… Oh! Yeah, now that you mention it. Years ago, when I was younger, I had my appendix out. That was… a long time ago. When I was still fishin', I think. And… I think I had somethin' on my knee taken care of when I was playin’ sports, but I was pretty young then, don't remember much about it. Just… somethin' on my knee. Is that what you need to know? It was a long, long time ago.
DOCTOR: Any family history of… anything significant?
PATIENT: Family history… My wife's side… they had some heart trouble, I think. Her mother, maybe? It was a while back. And… my own folks… they lived a long time, pretty healthy, as far as I know. My dad was a fisherman, strong as an ox. My mom… she mostly kept things runnin' at home. I don’t really… keep track of those things, ya know? It wasn't somethin' we talked about much. Does that help? I'm not very good with rememberin’ stuff like that.
DOCTOR: Alright. Allergies?
PATIENT: Allergies… Not that I know of. I eat pretty much anything. My wife always said I had an iron stomach. I never had any trouble with… pollen or nothin' like that. Never had a rash or trouble breathin' or… anythin'. Nope, no allergies, as far as I know. Never needed no special medicine or nothin'. Is that what you’re lookin' for?
DOCTOR: Currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Oh, right. The back pills. Like I said, when my back acts up. I take… uh… they're little white ones. Small, round, white pills. My wife always filled the prescription. I don’t know the name of 'em. And… sometimes I take somethin' for sleep, if I’m really restless. But not every night. A little blue pill, I think. Small too. That's it. Just the back pills and the sleep pills sometimes. I don’t really keep track, my wife handled all that.
DOCTOR: Okay. Let’s do a quick physical exam. Just to get a baseline, you understand. Blood pressure, pulse, listen to your heart and lungs. Routine. Can you stand up for me?
PATIENT: Yeah, sure. Routine's good. My wife always liked routine. Keeps things… orderly. There we go. Bit stiff this mornin', but I'm up. Go ahead, Doc. Do what you gotta do. Blood pressure and… lungs, huh? Just tell me if anythin's wrong. I mostly just wanna get this done, ya know? Make sure I'm still… alright.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is 140 over 90. Pulse is 72, regular. Lungs are clear, no wheezing or crackles. Heart sounds… normal. A bit elevated blood pressure, but not overly concerning at this time. BMI is 26.6, putting you in the overweight category. Do you exercise regularly?
PATIENT: Exercise… Well, movin’ freight is pretty good exercise, right? Liftin' and carryin' all day… it keeps me movin'. I don’t really… go to a gym or nothin’. Never been one for that. Just… workin’. Is that what you mean by exercise? I try to stay active. It’s hard work, though. Maybe that’s why my blood pressure is up a bit?
DOCTOR: Alright. Given your wife's concerns and your slightly elevated blood pressure, I recommend a few lifestyle modifications. Watch your diet, reduce salt intake, and try to incorporate some moderate exercise, even a daily walk, if possible. I’m going to order some basic bloodwork to get a more comprehensive picture. Cholesterol, blood sugar, kidney function, things like that. Here’s the order for the lab. You can go to any lab that accepts your insurance. Come back in two weeks with the results, and we’ll discuss them. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds… okay. Salt and walkin', huh? My wife always said I ate too much salt. She made the best fish stew, though. Hard to resist. Two weeks. I can do that. Just gotta remember where to go. My wife usually handled all these appointments… But yeah, I'll get it done. Salt, walkin', and bloodwork. Sounds like a plan. Thank you, Doc. I appreciate ya takin' the time. Is there anything else I should know?
DOCTOR: No, that will be all for today. The lab results will give us a better idea of your overall health. If you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath, or severe headache, seek immediate medical attention. Here's my card. Schedule a follow-up appointment with the receptionist when you have your results. Next patient!
