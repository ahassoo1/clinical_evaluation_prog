DOCTOR: Good morning, Tarin. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Beinborn. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It's a pleasure to meet you as well. I'm here because I've been experiencing some numbness in my leg. It's… rather persistent, and I thought it best to have it checked out. It's been going on for a little while now, actually.
DOCTOR: Okay, persistent numbness in your leg. That's good you came in to get it checked. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Certainly. It primarily affects my left leg, starting in my foot and sometimes extending up to my… well, just below my knee. It isn’t a complete loss of feeling, more of a… tingling and a sort of dullness. It’s not consistently there, either. Sometimes it’s quite noticeable, other times it fades to almost nothing. I do a fair amount of work standing, being an effects artist and all, so I initially thought it might just be from that.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it’s mainly in your left leg, starting in the foot and going up to just below the knee. Tingling and dullness, not a complete loss of sensation. And it comes and goes, and you initially thought it was work-related, given your job as an effects artist. When did you first notice this numbness?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think… it began sometime in late March, I believe. Around the 24th, perhaps? I was working on a rather large stop-motion project, spending long hours on my feet constructing sets and posing figures. At first, I just attributed it to fatigue. But it hasn’t really gone away, even after taking some time off. I recall specifically noticing it after a particularly long day rigging a miniature explosion sequence.
DOCTOR: Okay, late March, around the 24th. Started after a long day working on a stop-motion project, rigging a miniature explosion sequence. And it hasn’t resolved with time off. Has anything specific seemed to trigger it, besides prolonged standing?
PATIENT: That's a good question. No, not really a specific event, but I have noticed it seems worse after I’ve been… cold. Like, if I'm working in a cooler room, or if my leg gets chilled, the numbness becomes more pronounced. And it doesn't seem to be affected by activity level directly; it can happen whether I'm actively moving or resting. I haven’t experienced any pain, thankfully, just the… lack of sensation.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it’s worsened by cold temperatures, but not directly related to activity level, and there's no pain. That's helpful. Now, let’s talk a bit more broadly. Have you noticed any other symptoms accompanying the numbness?
PATIENT: Yes, actually. Thinking about it, there's been a slight weakness in my left foot and ankle, though it’s subtle. I haven't had any trouble walking or anything, but I do occasionally stumble a bit more than usual. It's difficult to describe… it’s almost like it takes a little more effort to lift my foot when I walk. And, now that I recall, my left foot does feel colder than my right, even when they’re both at room temperature. It’s a peculiar sensation.
DOCTOR: Okay, subtle weakness in the left foot and ankle, occasional stumbling, and your left foot feels colder than your right, even at room temperature. That's a good detail. Now, just to get a more complete picture, have you had any other medical issues in the past?
PATIENT: Yes. I broke my left wrist when I was about twelve, playing hockey. It healed cleanly and without complication, as far as I know, but I do occasionally experience a slight ache in the wrist if the weather is particularly damp. Otherwise, I've been fairly healthy. No chronic illnesses, allergies, or regular medications. I had the usual childhood vaccinations, and I had the flu shot last winter. I've not had any surgeries besides the standard removal of wisdom teeth when I turned eighteen.
DOCTOR: Okay, broken left wrist as a child, standard wisdom teeth removal, otherwise healthy. No chronic conditions, allergies, or medications. Good to know. What about your family?
PATIENT: That's a fair question. My mother has some mild arthritis in her hands, and my grandfather on my father’s side had diabetes, though it was diagnosed relatively late in his life. He lived to be eighty-seven, thankfully. Other than that, there aren’t any major hereditary medical concerns that I’m aware of. I haven’t observed any similar conditions in my siblings or other close relatives.
DOCTOR: Okay, mother with mild arthritis, grandfather with late-onset diabetes. No other significant family medical history. And finally, do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, I do not smoke, and I only drink alcohol very occasionally – perhaps a glass of wine with dinner a few times a year. I do not use any recreational drugs whatsoever. I maintain a reasonably healthy diet and try to get regular exercise when my work schedule allows. I find it important to take care of myself, given the physical demands of my profession.
DOCTOR: Okay, no smoking, minimal alcohol use, and no recreational drugs. Healthy diet and regular exercise. Alright, Tarin. Thank you for providing all that information. It gives me a much better understanding of what’s going on. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. I'll check your reflexes, muscle strength, and sensation in both legs.
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. That sounds perfectly reasonable. I’m happy to cooperate in any way that can help. Please, proceed at your own pace.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's start with reflexes. I’m going to gently tap on your knees and ankles with this little hammer. Just relax, and let your legs go loose. Okay, reflexes are… a little diminished on the left side compared to the right. Now, let’s check your muscle strength. Can you push your heel down against my hand, keeping your leg straight?
PATIENT: Certainly. Yes, of course. I’m pushing as hard as I can.
DOCTOR: Okay, and now the right side. Good. Strength is…slightly reduced on the left, but not dramatically. Now, let’s check sensation. I’m going to lightly touch your legs with this cotton ball. Just tell me when you feel it. Close your eyes, please. Okay, sensation is… noticeably decreased on the outer side of your left foot and lower leg, especially around the ankle. I'm noting that now. Alright. That’s all for the physical exam. Thank you for your cooperation. It seems we have some decreased reflexes and strength, and diminished sensation in your left leg. Based on what you’ve told me and the exam findings, I’m concerned about possible nerve compression or peripheral neuropathy.
PATIENT: I appreciate your thoroughness, Doctor. “Nerve compression or peripheral neuropathy”… those terms are somewhat concerning. Could you elaborate on what those might entail, and what the potential causes could be in my case? Is further testing required to determine the root of the problem?
DOCTOR: They are concerning terms, and I appreciate you asking for clarification. Nerve compression means a nerve is being squeezed somewhere along its path, often due to swelling or something pressing on it. Peripheral neuropathy, on the other hand, is damage to the nerves themselves. In your case, given your occupation and the symptoms you've described, a few things could be contributing. Prolonged standing and repetitive movements could lead to inflammation and compression, especially if there’s any tightness in the muscles or tendons around the ankle or foot. Cold temperatures can also exacerbate nerve symptoms. Less likely, but we need to rule it out, diabetes can cause peripheral neuropathy, though your family history isn’t strongly indicative. It's also possible, though less common, that there’s a more structural issue causing the compression. To determine the root of the problem, I recommend a couple of tests. First, an electromyography and nerve conduction study. This test measures the electrical activity of your nerves and muscles, and can help pinpoint the location and severity of any nerve damage or compression. Second, a blood test to check your blood sugar levels and rule out diabetes. Would you be comfortable with those tests?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds reasonable. I would absolutely be comfortable with those tests. I'd rather identify the problem and address it proactively. An EMG and a blood test… is there anything I should do to prepare for them? And approximately how long will it take to receive the results? I do have a project deadline approaching in a few weeks, and I’m hoping to get a clearer understanding of any potential limitations or accommodations I might need to make.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I’m glad to hear that. For the EMG, there's minimal preparation needed. Just avoid using any lotions or creams on your legs on the day of the test. It involves small needles, so if you have a needle phobia, please let the technician know beforehand, and they can take extra precautions. The technician will clean the skin and insert small needles into your muscles to record electrical activity. It might cause some brief discomfort, but it’s generally well-tolerated. The blood test requires a standard fasting blood sugar level, so you’ll need to refrain from eating or drinking anything for at least eight hours before the test. The results usually take about 3-5 business days to come back. Once I have them, I’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them in detail and develop a treatment plan. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding prolonged standing and repetitive movements as much as possible. You can try over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or naproxen to manage any discomfort, and wearing supportive shoes. Do you have any questions about any of that?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, that's all quite clear. Thank you for explaining everything so thoroughly. "Avoid prolonged standing" is… challenging, given my profession, but I will certainly make a conscious effort to minimize it and take frequent breaks. I also appreciate the suggestion of over-the-counter pain relief. I believe that covers everything for now. Could you please provide me with any necessary paperwork for the tests and details regarding scheduling them? I’d like to get them arranged as soon as possible.
DOCTOR: Certainly. Here is a requisition form for both the EMG/nerve conduction study and the blood work. It includes the lab addresses and phone numbers. You can usually schedule the appointments online or by phone. The lab typically requires a referral from your primary care physician. I will also send this information electronically to your primary care provider. And here's a note summarizing our conversation and the recommended tests, in case you’d like to share it with your primary care physician. Do you have any questions about filling out the forms or scheduling the appointments?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, the forms appear straightforward enough. And I appreciate you sending the information to my primary care provider. That will certainly streamline the process. I believe I have everything I need for now. Thank you again for your time and attention. I feel much more informed and prepared, and I appreciate your thoroughness and patient explanations. I'll schedule the tests as soon as possible and reach out if any questions arise.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Tarin. I'm glad I could help. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. I look forward to seeing you again after the tests. Have a good day, and take care of yourself.
