DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Wrye. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Abady. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Abady, is it? Yes, well, it's about a letter, really. A pet ownership letter, someone told me I needed one. Honestly, I can’t quite recall who said that, or exactly why... something about bringing a little… friend, somewhere. It’s all a bit fuzzy, you see. A friend of a friend needed it, I think? Or maybe it was for me… honestly, my memory isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Certainly. It sounds like you may be referring to an Emotional Support Animal letter, or perhaps documentation related to a service animal. These letters often have specific requirements and are used for various purposes, such as housing or travel. To clarify, Ms. Wrye, are you looking for documentation to support bringing an animal with you somewhere, or are you seeking assistance with an animal you already have?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, all those words… Emotional Support… Service… It’s all a bit much, Doctor. Look, I just need the letter, okay? Someone said I needed it, and I’m trying to get it. It's for... traveling, I think. Yes, traveling. With… well, with a small dog. A very small dog. A friend's dog, mostly. Though I might… keep him for a bit, you know? It’s complicated. Do you just… write the letter?
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Wrye. It sounds like you're seeking a letter to allow you to travel with a dog. To properly assess whether documentation is appropriate, and to ensure it meets any required guidelines, I’ll need to ask a few questions. This isn't simply a matter of writing a letter, as there are specific criteria that must be met. It relates to a documented need for an animal to provide support for a disability or medical condition. Would you mind if we start by discussing your overall health and any conditions you currently manage?
PATIENT: Oh, conditions? Doctor, honestly, I'm perfectly healthy. A little forgetful, perhaps, but that’s just… age, isn’t it? I don’t have conditions. I keep myself active, I eat reasonably well… well, mostly. What does my health have to do with a little dog and a trip? This is getting very complicated. I just want the letter, you know? Can’t you just ask me what kind of dog it is and write it down?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Wrye. You're right, it may seem unnecessarily complicated. However, to ensure the documentation is valid and legally sound – especially for travel – I need to confirm that there is a legitimate medical or psychological need for the animal to accompany you. It's not simply about the type of dog, but why having the dog with you is essential for your well-being. Let me assure you, I'm not trying to be difficult. I'm simply following established guidelines. Perhaps we can approach it this way: could you describe any ways in which the dog helps you?
PATIENT: Well, he's… comforting. He's a small dog, very fluffy. And… he doesn't shed much, which is a plus. Honestly, Doctor, I don't need a reason to want to travel with a perfectly well-behaved little dog! It’s a bit insulting to even ask, really. It's not like I'm asking for a full-grown elephant on the plane. I just… like having him around. He’s a good companion. Is that enough? I really don’t want to delve into… personal things. This is becoming rather unpleasant.
DOCTOR: I appreciate you sharing that, Ms. Wrye. It sounds like the dog provides you with companionship and emotional support, which is certainly valuable. However, for documentation to be considered valid, it generally needs to be tied to a diagnosed mental health or medical condition. Simply stating companionship isn’t typically sufficient, as it doesn't meet the legal criteria for an Emotional Support Animal or Service Animal. To be clear, I'm not questioning your need for companionship, but rather the requirements for obtaining a legitimate letter. Would you be open to discussing whether you’ve been diagnosed with any conditions – such as anxiety, depression, or another mental health concern – that the dog helps to alleviate?
PATIENT: Oh, now we're getting somewhere. Diagnosed? Doctor, I am a perfectly rational, capable woman! I do not need a diagnosis to enjoy the company of a small, fluffy dog. This is absolutely ridiculous. Honestly, I’ve wasted enough of my time here. It sounds like you aren't going to write the letter, and frankly, I’m not sure I want you to, after all this… probing. I think I’ll just find another doctor. A more… understanding doctor. Thank you for your time, Doctor. But I believe I’ll be going now. .
DOCTOR: Ms. Wrye, I understand your frustration, and I apologize if my questions felt intrusive. However, I have a professional and ethical obligation to ensure any documentation I provide is accurate and legally sound. As I explained, simply wanting companionship doesn’t meet the necessary criteria. I respect your decision to seek another physician. Before you leave, I would like to offer a referral to a mental health professional if you are interested. They could provide a proper assessment and, if appropriate, documentation if you meet the criteria for an Emotional Support Animal or Service Animal. Here is a list of qualified professionals in the area. Thank you for your time, and I wish you all the best.
