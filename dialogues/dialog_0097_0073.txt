DOCTOR: Hi Triana, welcome! It's lovely to meet you. I'm Dr. Georgiou. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Look, I already told the nurse. It's my stomach. It just…won't stop. And nothing seems to help. I've tried everything the pharmacy suggested. It’s been going on for weeks. Frankly, it's embarrassing to even talk about.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It is frustrating when something goes on for weeks and over-the-counter remedies aren’t cutting it, and you’re right, stomach issues can be tough to discuss. No need to be embarrassed at all – it’s my job to help figure things out. So, “won’t stop” – can you tell me a little more about how it won’t stop?
PATIENT: What do you mean, how? It's diarrhea, okay? I go to the bathroom…a lot. Like, constantly. And it's…watery. Is that what you want to know? Honestly, I don’t see what more detail you need. I've barely left the house in a week because of it.
DOCTOR: Okay, watery diarrhea, and it's been going on for a week… consistently. I appreciate you clarifying – it helps me get a clearer picture. And I'm so sorry to hear it's keeping you housebound; that sounds really difficult. When you say “constantly,” about how many times a day are we talking?
PATIENT: Ugh, I don’t count. It's not like I’m keeping a log! But…probably at least ten times a day. Maybe more. It wakes me up at night, too. It's just…awful. And it's not like a normal stomach bug, it just keeps going. I just want it to stop already.
DOCTOR: Ten times a day, waking you up at night… that is significant, and definitely not something to ignore. And you're right, it shouldn’t be dragging on this long. Okay, let’s try to piece things together. Has anything changed in your diet recently?
PATIENT: Diet? No. I eat…normal food. I haven’t been trying any fancy new restaurants or anything. It’s not like I’m suddenly eating spoiled fish or something. I eat what I always eat. Look, I’m a practical person. I don’t think my diet is the problem here. Maybe it’s something I picked up? Though where, I have no idea. I haven't been traveling.
DOCTOR: Okay, no changes in diet, and no recent travel. That helps rule a few things out. And you’re right to consider if you might have picked something up. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms along with the diarrhea?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Like what? I'm tired, obviously. From running to the bathroom all the time. And…my stomach cramps a bit. But that’s it. No fever, no vomiting. Just…this. It’s really just this awful diarrhea. I don't get why I have to explain every little thing.
DOCTOR: You're right, you shouldn’t have to explain every little thing. I'm just trying to get a complete picture, and you've been very helpful so far. Cramping and tiredness are good to know. Now, when you say cramping, where exactly is the pain located?
PATIENT: Everywhere. It's just…my whole stomach hurts. Lower part, mostly. It’s not like a sharp pain, it’s just…uncomfortable. And it comes and goes. It's hard to describe. Look, I’m not a doctor, okay? I just know my stomach feels terrible and won't leave me alone.
DOCTOR: I understand. “Terrible” and won’t leave you alone is definitely enough to go on. Lower abdominal cramping that comes and goes. Now, thinking about your medical history – have you ever had any issues with your stomach or intestines before?
PATIENT: Not really. I had a bout of food poisoning years ago, when I was traveling in Alaska. But that was ages ago. And I’ve always had a…sensitive stomach, I guess. But nothing like this. This is…different. It’s just…persistent. And exhausting. Look, I’m a painter. I need to be able to, you know, function. I can’t be running to the bathroom all day.
DOCTOR: Okay, a bout of food poisoning years ago, and generally a sensitive stomach, but this is much worse and persistent. And you're a painter – I understand needing to be able to function. Let's talk about your family history. Do any of your close family members have any history of digestive problems, like irritable bowel syndrome, Crohn’s disease, or colitis?
PATIENT: Family history? Honestly, who keeps track of that? My mother had…something with her gallbladder, I think. Years ago. And my grandmother…she just always complained about her stomach. But that was just old age, probably. I really don’t know. We weren't a family that talked about…that stuff. Look, I'm telling you, I've never had anything like this before. It just came on suddenly and won't go away. Can we just get to the part where you tell me how to fix it?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, and I appreciate you sharing what you remember. It sounds like there isn’t a strong family history of digestive problems. Okay. Let's move on to some quick questions about your current medications and allergies. Are you currently taking any medications, prescription or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: Just some vitamins. A multivitamin, and Vitamin D, because of the winters. And…sometimes I take ibuprofen for aches and pains, if I’ve been painting all day. That’s it. No allergies, as far as I know. I've never had a reaction to anything. Honestly, I'm a pretty healthy person. Usually. This is just…weird. And inconvenient.
DOCTOR: Okay, multivitamins, Vitamin D, and occasional ibuprofen. No known allergies. Alright, Triana. I think I have enough information for now. Would you mind if I did a quick physical exam?
PATIENT: Fine. But don't expect me to be comfortable with…prodding around. Just get it over with. I have things to do, you know. I need to get back to work. This is taking up my whole day.
DOCTOR: Of course. It won't take long, and I'll be as gentle as possible. I'm just going to listen to your stomach with my stethoscope, and then I’ll gently press on your abdomen to check for any tenderness. I’ll also check your reflexes and listen to your heart and lungs, just to get a full picture. Okay, I’m listening now. Your bowel sounds are a bit…hyperactive, which isn’t surprising with the diarrhea. And I do notice some tenderness in your lower abdomen, particularly on your left side. It’s not severe, but it's definitely present. Your reflexes are normal, and your heart and lungs sound clear. I don't feel any masses.
PATIENT: See? I told you. It hurts there. Just a little, but it's definitely there. What does that mean? Is it something serious? I really don’t have time for something serious. I have a commission due next month. Can we just…skip the rest of the exam? I'm ready to hear what I need to do to fix this, already.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand your concern. And I’m glad we identified the tenderness. The tenderness in your lower left abdomen, combined with the hyperactive bowel sounds and the persistent diarrhea, is suggestive of a few possibilities. It could be something as simple as a viral gastroenteritis, but given the duration and your symptoms, we need to rule out other causes. I'm not going to dismiss anything without further investigation. To be thorough, I'd like to order a stool sample to check for any infections and to rule out parasites. I'd also like to order a blood test to check for inflammation and to see if you're dehydrated. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Blood test and a stool sample? Seriously? That's…disgusting. And inconvenient. Look, I really don’t want to spend my whole life in a doctor’s office. Is there anything else I can do? Like, a medication, or…something? I just want this to be over with. Can't you just give me something to stop it? I don’t care what it is. I just need it to stop. .
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Triana, and I truly wish I could just prescribe something to make it all go away. But rushing into a treatment without knowing the cause could actually make things worse. There are medications that can help manage the symptoms, like loperamide to slow down the diarrhea, but it's important to know why it's happening before using them. Sometimes, stopping the diarrhea can trap an infection inside, which isn’t ideal. For now, let's get the stool sample and blood test done. It's the most responsible way to figure out what's going on and get you the right treatment. The lab is just down the hall, and the nurse can help you collect the sample. Then, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results as soon as they're available, likely in a few days. In the meantime, I recommend staying hydrated with clear fluids, eating bland foods like toast and rice, and getting as much rest as possible. Does that sound alright?
