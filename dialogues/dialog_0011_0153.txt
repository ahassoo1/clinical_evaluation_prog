DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Krahn. My name is Dr. Christopher Neppl. It’s a pleasure to meet you. I see here you’re 69 years of age. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Neppl, you said? Yes, 69… feels older some days, I tell you what. Something about a… clearance? For a performance, I think. Honestly, these things… they send me these papers, and I just… fill them out to get it over with. I don't really remember all the details. It's about acting, I believe. Or maybe… ushering? I do a little of both.
DOCTOR: Thank you for clarifying, Mr. Krahn. It sounds like this is a medical clearance form for a performance-related activity – either acting or ushering, or perhaps both. That's perfectly alright; these forms can be quite confusing. To best assist you, let’s go through some questions to ensure you're medically fit to participate. To begin, could you tell me a little more about the nature of this performance?
PATIENT: Nature… Oh dear. That's a good question. Honestly? It changes. Sometimes it’s just standing in the lobby, taking tickets. Very little physical effort. Other times… there's a small theater downtown, they do… historical reenactments. I played a… a general once. Lots of walking. And… shouting, I suppose. It's not strenuous, but it keeps me on my feet. I really don't remember which performance this clearance is for specifically. They just send the form, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Krahn. It sounds like the demands can vary. That’s helpful to know. To get a clearer picture, let’s focus on a typical performance week, if possible. Would you say, on average, how many hours per week you spend on your feet, walking or performing, and roughly how often do you engage in the more physically demanding activities like shouting or reenactment work?
PATIENT: Hmm… a typical week… Let me think. Usually, it's… three or four evenings, maybe four hours each time. Standing mostly. The… reenactment stuff? Not every week. Maybe once a month? Twice, if I’m lucky. That probably adds another… two or three hours, easy. But sometimes they rehearse, so it could be more. It’s hard to say precisely. I mostly just show up where they tell me and do what I'm asked. I don’t keep track of the hours, Doctor. I really don't.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Krahn. An estimate is very helpful. Now, let’s move on to your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any chronic medical conditions – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, heart disease, lung problems, or arthritis?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s… a lot of things. Let me see… I had a bit of trouble with my blood pressure a few years back, the doctor put me on something for it. But I stopped taking it, I think. It seemed to go away on its own. And… my knees ache sometimes. Just from getting old, I suppose. Nothing… serious, though. I’ve never been told I had any of those other things you mentioned – heart disease or lung problems. My divorce was a bigger health issue, if you want the truth.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Mr. Krahn. We can certainly explore the knee pain further. And it’s good to know about the history of high blood pressure. Just to confirm, have you ever been hospitalized for anything, or had any major surgeries?
PATIENT: Hospitalized… Hmm. Let me think. When I was a boy, I had my tonsils out. That was a long time ago. And… my wife, bless her soul, she had a hip replacement a few years before… well, before everything. I went with her, of course. But I haven't been hospitalized myself, not since the tonsils. No surgeries either, except for those tonsils. Is that good? I hope that's good. I try to stay out of hospitals, if I can help it.
DOCTOR: That is good, Mr. Krahn. Very good. Now, are you currently taking any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, vitamins, or herbal supplements?
PATIENT: No, no medications. Not currently. I used to take something for… indigestion, I think. But I stopped that a long time ago. I find a cup of tea does just as well. And… maybe a little ginger now and then. But nothing a doctor would prescribe. Just… everyday things. I’m trying to keep things simple, you see. Less pills, less trouble.
DOCTOR: Excellent. And do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, no allergies. Not that I know of. I eat everything. My ex-wife was the picky eater, always complaining about something. I never had any trouble with food, or anything else, really. I’ve been stung by a bee once or twice, but that didn’t last long. Just a little swelling, nothing serious. So, no. No allergies.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. Now, to finish up with your history, could you tell me a little about your family’s medical history?
PATIENT: Family history… Oh dear. That’s a long story. My mother… she lived to be a very old age, but she had… something with her heart, I think. She was always tired. My father… he was a strong man, but he smoked a lot. He got… something with his lungs, near the end. I had an older brother, but he… he passed away young. A car accident. Didn't really know him well. It was all a long time ago, and I don’t remember the details. We weren’t a very close family, if I’m honest. It’s hard to say what runs in the family. Not much good, probably.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Mr. Krahn. That gives me a good overview. Now, I'd like to do a brief physical exam, if that’s alright with you. Just to check your heart, lungs, blood pressure, and make sure everything seems stable. It won’t take long. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Oh. A physical exam… Well, I suppose so. As long as it doesn’t take too long. I have… things to do, you see. But yes, alright. Go ahead. Just be gentle, please. My knees aren’t what they used to be. And try not to make a fuss. I get… flustered easily.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Krahn. I will be as gentle as possible. We'll take things at your pace. First, I’ll listen to your heart and lungs with the stethoscope. Please take a deep breath in… and out… Good. Your heart sounds good and steady, and your lungs are clear. Now, I'll check your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is a little elevated today, 148 over 82. As we discussed, you previously took medication for this. Now, could you please extend your arms for me?
PATIENT: Elevated, you say? Oh dear. Well, I haven’t been feeling particularly stressed lately. Maybe it’s the excitement of… the performance. Or maybe it’s just getting old. There. Arms extended. Not as flexible as they used to be, you know. Everything aches these days. Is that bad? Is something wrong?
DOCTOR: It’s not necessarily bad, Mr. Krahn, but it’s something we should be aware of. The mild discomfort with movement is likely due to age-related changes, and your blood pressure is a bit higher than ideal. I'm going to check your knees now. Could you please bend them for me, if that's alright?
PATIENT: Oh… my knees. Well, alright. But be gentle, please. They creak like an old ship. There. Bent. Not as far as they used to go, you know. Used to be able to squat down no problem. Now… it’s just… painful. Is it bad? Am I going to need a replacement?
DOCTOR: There is some crepitus and mild tenderness, which is consistent with osteoarthritis, Mr. Krahn. It’s a common condition as we get older. We are not at the point of needing a replacement at this time. There’s some limitation in range of motion, but it doesn’t appear severe. Now, I will just check your reflexes briefly. Please relax your legs. Your reflexes are normal. Overall, your examination reveals a slightly elevated blood pressure and some mild osteoarthritis in your knees. The rest of your examination is within normal limits.
PATIENT: Oh. Osteoarthritis. That’s what my mother had. Just… old age, you say? Nothing serious? And my blood pressure? Should I… start taking those pills again? I really didn't like taking them, made me feel… strange. Is it alright for me to… continue with the performance? I don’t want to cause any trouble, but I promised them I’d be there.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Krahn, osteoarthritis is very common with age. It’s not life-threatening, but it can cause discomfort. We can discuss ways to manage the pain, such as over-the-counter pain relievers, physical therapy, and lifestyle modifications. Regarding your blood pressure, it is mildly elevated, and restarting medication is an option. However, before we make a decision, let’s try some lifestyle changes first – reducing salt intake, regular exercise, and stress management. We can monitor your blood pressure for a few weeks and see if those changes make a difference. As for the performance, given your overall condition, it should be alright for you to continue, but I recommend you listen to your body. If you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath, or significant knee pain, please stop immediately and consult with me or seek medical attention. It's important not to overexert yourself. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s… good to hear. Lifestyle changes… I can try that. Less salt… I suppose I eat a lot of soy sauce. And stress… well, that's a little harder. Listen to my body… yes. That makes sense. No chest pain… I’ll remember that. Um… yes. One question. If I do need to take the pills again, are there any… side effects I should be aware of? I remember feeling… dizzy sometimes, and a little… sluggish. And is there anything I can do to… help my knees? Some kind of cream or ointment, maybe? And thank you, Doctor. For being so patient with an old man like me.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Krahn. It's my pleasure. Regarding the medication, common side effects can include dizziness, fatigue, and sometimes a dry cough. If you experience any significant side effects, please let me know immediately, and we can explore alternative medications. For your knees, there are several options we can consider. Over-the-counter pain relievers, such as ibuprofen or naproxen, can help reduce inflammation and pain. Topical creams, like diclofenac gel, can also provide localized relief. Additionally, physical therapy can help strengthen the muscles around your knees and improve range of motion. Weight management can also significantly reduce stress on your knees. I’ll provide you with a handout outlining these options, as well as some resources for physical therapy in the area. We can also schedule a follow-up appointment in a few weeks to monitor your blood pressure and assess your knee pain. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s wonderful. A handout… yes, that would be very helpful. I always forget things, you see. And physical therapy… I suppose I should try that. It can't hurt, right? A follow-up appointment… yes, that sounds good. In a few weeks, you said? Give me time to… try these things. Thank you again, Doctor. You’ve put my mind at ease. I really appreciate your patience and kindness. I suppose… that’s all for now. Unless you have any other questions for me?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Krahn. I’m glad I could help. No, I don’t have any further questions for you at this time. Just remember to listen to your body, take things at your own pace, and don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns. Here’s the handout and a referral to a physical therapy clinic nearby. The nurse will be in shortly to review your discharge instructions and schedule your follow-up appointment. Take care, Mr. Krahn, and enjoy the performance!
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. I will. I really appreciate everything. Enjoy the performance… yes. I certainly hope I can. Thank you again!
