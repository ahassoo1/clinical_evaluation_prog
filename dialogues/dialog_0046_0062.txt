DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Knabenshue. My name is Dr. Glowka, and I’m an Internal Medicine physician here at the clinic. It’s nice to meet you. To start, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor Glowka. It is a pleasure to meet you too. I am here today regarding a matter with my work. Specifically, about the masks they are requiring us to wear. It is causing me some difficulty, and I was hoping to discuss the possibility of an exemption.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Knabenshue. It sounds like the mask requirement at work is creating a challenge for you, and you’re hoping to explore a potential exemption. That's perfectly reasonable to discuss. To help me understand the situation better, could you describe the difficulties you're experiencing while wearing the mask?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. It’s…well, it feels like it’s restricting my breathing a bit. Not severely, but enough that it makes focusing on my duties difficult. I work as a protective service worker, you see, and I need to be alert and able to react quickly. The mask…it makes that harder. It also causes a bit of…discomfort, around my face, and I find myself adjusting it constantly, which is distracting. I have tried different types, but none seem to fully resolve the issue.
DOCTOR: Thank you for explaining that, Mr. Knabenshue. It's good you've already tried different mask types – that gives us a good starting point. So, to clarify, the discomfort and breathing restriction are impacting your ability to concentrate and react quickly at work, which is essential for your role as a protective service worker. Could you tell me how long you've been experiencing these difficulties with the masks?
PATIENT: That is correct, Doctor. You understand perfectly. And yes, it has been…let me see…approximately three weeks now, since the mask requirement began. It was initially just a mild annoyance, but it has steadily worsened. I hoped it would resolve on its own, but it hasn’t. I tried to push through, but it’s becoming increasingly noticeable and impacting my work.
DOCTOR: Okay, three weeks – that's helpful to know. And it’s good you’re being proactive about addressing it now, before it potentially impacts your ability to perform your duties effectively. Before we discuss potential exemptions, I'd like to gather a bit more information to get a clearer picture of what might be going on. Have you had any similar issues with breathing difficulties or discomfort in the past, perhaps unrelated to masks?
PATIENT: That is a fair question, Doctor. To the best of my recollection, no. I have not experienced anything like this previously. I have always been in good health, and I maintain a fairly active lifestyle when my duties permit. I’ve never had any trouble with asthma, allergies, or anything of that nature. This discomfort truly began with the mask requirement, as far as I can tell. I do occasionally get a bit winded from physical exertion, naturally, but this is different.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good information to have, Mr. Knabenshue. So, no prior history of breathing problems, allergies, or asthma, and the issue seems directly correlated with the start of the mask requirement. Let’s do a quick physical exam to assess your breathing and overall health. I'll listen to your lungs, check your heart rate and blood pressure, and just do a general assessment. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly reasonable. I am happy to cooperate in any way that might help determine the cause of this issue. Please proceed when you are ready. I will do my best to remain still and follow any instructions you may have.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Knabenshue. First, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. I'll ask you to take deep breaths in and out through your mouth. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. No wheezing, crackles, or rhonchi noted. Respiratory rate is 16 breaths per minute, which is within the normal range. Your lymph nodes are not enlarged. Oxygen saturation is 98% on room air, which is excellent. Blood pressure is 130/80, and pulse is 72 beats per minute. Overall, your vital signs are within normal limits, and your physical exam is unremarkable. This makes it less likely there's an underlying respiratory condition causing the discomfort. Now, just to be thorough, do you have any other symptoms at all – perhaps a cough, fever, fatigue, or headaches?
PATIENT: That is good to know, Doctor. I appreciate your thoroughness. And no, thankfully, I do not have any other symptoms. No cough, fever, fatigue, or headaches. As I said before, it is specifically the sensation of restriction and discomfort caused by the mask itself. It does not occur without it. I am grateful that you have not found any immediate cause for concern. Perhaps it is simply a matter of sensitivity, then?
DOCTOR: It's good that there aren't any other accompanying symptoms, Mr. Knabenshue. Given your normal vital signs and the absence of other concerning findings on the physical exam, it seems less likely that there is an underlying medical condition causing the issue. It's possible you have a sensitivity to the mask material or the pressure it exerts on your face. It’s also possible there’s a slight anatomical factor that makes mask-wearing less comfortable for you. Before we discuss potential exemptions, I want to ensure we’ve explored all reasonable options. Have you tried masks with adjustable nose clips and/or ear loops?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, I have. My employer provided several different types, and I made sure to request those with adjustable features. I tried tightening and loosening them, and experimenting with the nose clip to get a better fit. It does offer a small amount of relief, but the sensation of restriction remains. I have also tried masks made of different materials – cloth, paper, and the surgical-style ones – but none seem to fully alleviate the discomfort. I even considered a face shield, but my employer indicated that it would not meet their safety requirements.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you've thoughtfully tried different mask types and adjustments, and even considered a face shield, all without significant relief. That’s very helpful information. Given your history, physical exam findings, and attempts to mitigate the issue, it does seem like you may have a genuine difficulty with mask tolerance. Now, regarding the possibility of an exemption from the mask requirement, I can write a note to your employer outlining your symptoms, my examination findings, and my assessment that you may have a difficulty with mask tolerance. However, it's important to understand that the decision to grant an exemption ultimately lies with your employer, as they have their own safety protocols to uphold. They may require additional documentation or suggest alternative accommodations. Would you like me to write a note for your employer outlining these findings?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that would be most appreciated. A note from you outlining my situation would be tremendously helpful. I understand and accept that the final decision rests with my employer, and I do not wish to impose any undue hardship on them. I simply hope they will consider my limitations and perhaps explore alternative accommodations, if possible. Thank you for your time and thoroughness; you have been very helpful.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Knabenshue. I'm happy to help. I’ll include details about your symptoms, the normal findings from your physical exam, your attempts to find a comfortable mask, and my assessment that you may have a difficulty with mask tolerance. I will also state that you are seeking possible alternative accommodations. Here is the note. It summarizes our conversation and my findings. Please review it to ensure it accurately reflects our discussion. Do you have any questions for me before we conclude today’s visit?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. Yes, this is a perfect summary of our conversation, and it accurately reflects my situation. I truly appreciate you taking the time to document this so thoroughly. No, I do not have any further questions at this time. You have addressed all of my concerns and provided me with valuable information. I am grateful for your assistance. I suppose there is nothing left to do but submit this to my employer and hope for the best. Thank you again for your time and consideration, Doctor Glowka. Have a wonderful day.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Knabenshue. I’m glad I could help. I hope your employer is understanding, and that you’re able to find a solution that allows you to continue your important work safely and comfortably. If you have any further concerns or questions in the future, please don’t hesitate to reach out. Have a wonderful day as well, and stay safe. .
PATIENT: It is very kind of you to say so, Doctor. I will certainly keep that in mind. And thank you again for your excellent care. Have a lovely day as well, Doctor Glowka. .
