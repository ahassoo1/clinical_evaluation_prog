DOCTOR: Hi Marija, welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Georgiou. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good day, Doctor. It is a pleasure, though I confess I find these sorts of visits…necessary evils, one might say. I am here because my husband, bless his heart, is quite insistent I have… arrangements made. Something about what happens if I am unable to… communicate my wishes. He keeps mentioning a form. An advance directive, I believe he called it. And a POLST form. Honestly, the man worries over everything.
DOCTOR: It sounds like your husband is a very thoughtful man, Marija. And you’re right to come in—planning ahead like that is a really responsible thing to do, even if it doesn’t feel particularly…enjoyable. Both the advance directive and the POLST form are about making sure your healthcare wishes are respected, should you ever be in a situation where you can’t speak for yourself. Let’s talk through them a bit. First, let’s focus on why you'd want these forms. Have you given any thought to what kinds of medical situations you’d want to have a say in, if you were unable to communicate?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, I haven’t. And I’m not entirely sure I want to. It feels…morbid, dwelling on such things. My husband, he’s been reading articles, of course. He speaks of “end-of-life care” and “quality of life.” Very dramatic. But truthfully, I’ve always believed these decisions are best left to…well, to fate, and to the good judgement of the doctors. I trust medical professionals. I expect you to know what’s best. Is it absolutely necessary I fill out these forms? Perhaps my husband can simply explain my…general preferences? I lead a very healthy life, you see. I don’t anticipate needing such…measures.
DOCTOR: I completely understand your hesitation, Marija. It is unsettling to think about these things, and it’s very common to feel that way. And you’re right, trusting your medical team is important. However, these forms aren't really about taking away that trust; they’re about ensuring your values are known, even when you can’t speak for yourself. It's about clarifying what "quality of life" means to you, so we can honor that. While it’s not legally required, having these forms can prevent a lot of stress for your family, should something unexpected happen. It helps them advocate for you, knowing what you would want. Your husband can certainly explain your preferences, but sometimes, in a difficult situation, memories can be unclear. A written document is very helpful. Let’s think about it this way: we're not predicting the future, just preparing for possibilities. Would you be open to me simply asking you a few questions about your general wishes, and we can see if putting anything in writing feels comfortable?
PATIENT: Questions, I suppose, are acceptable. Though I maintain this is all rather… unnecessary. And please, do not expect detailed responses. I am not one for lengthy discussions about hypothetical illnesses. Just ask, and I will answer as briefly as possible. And if I find the line of questioning too…distressing, I shall simply request we cease. Is that acceptable?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Marija. That’s perfectly acceptable. We’ll take it at your pace, and we can stop at any time. Just brief answers are fine. Let’s start with something broad. Generally speaking, if you were facing a serious illness where recovery was unlikely, would you prioritize trying every possible treatment, even if those treatments had significant side effects and wouldn’t necessarily improve your quality of life…or would you lean more towards comfort and minimizing suffering?
PATIENT: Comfort, without question. I have always believed in a dignified exit. Prolonging life at any cost…it seems rather barbaric. I have seen enough suffering in my life, thank you very much. No, I would not want to be subjected to a battery of unpleasant procedures simply to extend my days by a few weeks or months, especially if it meant a diminished quality of life. Is that…sufficiently brief? I do hope this isn’t becoming a philosophical debate.
DOCTOR: That is very clear, Marija, and perfectly sufficient. It's helpful to know your preference. So, prioritizing comfort and minimizing suffering. Now, thinking along those lines… are there any circumstances, even with a poor prognosis, where you would want all possible life-sustaining treatments attempted, even if they were aggressive?
PATIENT: Absolutely not. None whatsoever. I have made that abundantly clear, haven’t I? Life-sustaining treatments…aggressive procedures…it all sounds rather dreadful. I trust you will remember my wishes. Really, Doctor, I cannot fathom a scenario where I would request such things. It goes against everything I believe. Are we nearing the end of this…interrogation? I find it rather exhausting.
DOCTOR: We are getting there, Marija. And I apologize if it feels like an interrogation—that's certainly not my intention. I’m just trying to understand your values. One final question, and then we can talk about the forms themselves, and if you’d like to fill them out. If you were to become seriously ill and unable to make decisions, would you want your husband to be the person making those decisions for you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. My husband. He is… perfectly capable. Though sometimes a bit overly cautious, as I mentioned. But he is intelligent and well-meaning. He knows my… general temperament, and what I would likely want. He is my power of attorney, is he not? He handles all the finances and…these sorts of things. He can speak for me. Though, to be perfectly honest, I hope it never comes to that. I much prefer to make my own decisions, thank you very much.
DOCTOR: Excellent. So, your husband as your designated healthcare proxy. That’s very good to know. Now, let’s talk about the forms themselves. There are two main ones. The advance directive, sometimes called a living will, is a document where you can outline your wishes regarding specific medical treatments—like whether or not you’d want a breathing machine or feeding tube. The POLST form—Physician Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment—is a bit more specific; it’s a medical order that tells healthcare providers what treatments you want—or don't want—in the event of a medical crisis. It’s typically used for people with serious illnesses. Given our conversation, it sounds like an advance directive might be the most helpful option for you at this time. It allows you to clearly state your wishes regarding life-sustaining treatment. We don't necessarily need to complete a POLST form right now, unless you feel strongly about outlining specific orders for a medical emergency. Would you like me to bring the advance directive form, and we can go through it together?
PATIENT: Perhaps. But I must reiterate, I am not promising to fill it out. I simply wish to…review it. To see what is involved. And please, Doctor, do not use complicated language. I am not a medical professional, and I have no desire to become one. Keep it simple, and concise. And if I find the wording too…overbearing, I shall simply decline. Is that understood? I do believe I am rather tiring myself out with all this talk of illness and…procedures.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Marija. Perfectly understood. We’ll take it slow, and I’ll use plain language. No pressure at all. We can review it together, and if you’re not comfortable, we’ll simply stop. No need to fill anything out you don't want to. Let me go get the form, and then we can go through it together, section by section. It’s not a long document, and we can take as much time as you need. Would you like a glass of water while we wait?
PATIENT: A glass of water would be lovely, thank you. And do hurry, if you would be so kind. I find myself feeling rather…drained. All this talk of hypothetical illnesses is quite unsettling, you know. It makes one feel… vulnerable. Yes, a glass of water would be most appreciated. And then, let us get this over with.
DOCTOR: Here you are. Please, take your time. Alright, let's take a look at the form together. It’s divided into sections, and we can go through each one slowly. The first section asks about your general wishes regarding life-sustaining treatment. It asks if you would want all possible measures taken to prolong your life, even if there’s no reasonable hope of recovery, or if you would prefer a more comfort-focused approach. Does that sound alright to start with?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds…acceptable. Though, as we discussed, I have already made my wishes perfectly clear. I do not wish for “all possible measures” taken. I prefer comfort. So, whatever the form says, I shall simply state that. I trust that is sufficient. I do not require lengthy explanations, thank you very much. Just allow me to mark the appropriate box, and we can move on. This is all rather tedious, don't you think? One would think a simple conversation would suffice. But no, we must fill out forms and…and boxes. It's all very bureaucratic.
DOCTOR: You're absolutely right, a simple conversation should suffice, and I appreciate you stating your wishes so clearly. The form is just a way to document those wishes, for clarity and to avoid any misunderstandings. Here’s the section regarding life-sustaining treatment. It asks if you want “aggressive medical treatment” or “comfort-focused care.” You can simply check the box for "comfort-focused care." Take your time. I’m here if you have any questions, but otherwise, feel free to just mark the box that reflects your wishes. And if you decide you don't want to continue at any point, that's perfectly fine.
PATIENT: There. Done. Is that sufficient? Can we move on? I trust there isn’t much more to this…exercise. Really, Doctor, I find this all rather…degrading. It feels as though I am being asked to anticipate my own demise. And I have no desire to dwell on such morbid thoughts. Let us simply finish with this, and I can return to my… more pleasant pursuits.
DOCTOR: Yes, that is perfect, Marija. Thank you. You’ve clearly stated your wishes, and that’s what’s most important. The next section asks about artificial nutrition and hydration—meaning, whether or not you would want to be fed and given fluids through a tube if you were unable to eat or drink on your own. Would you like to discuss that section, or would you prefer to simply check the box that aligns with your preference for comfort-focused care?
PATIENT: Simply check the box, Doctor. Honestly, I find this all rather… repetitive. If I wish for comfort, then I wish for comfort in all things. No tubes, no aggressive procedures, no prolonged suffering. Just…comfort. I do not require a detailed explanation of every possible scenario. The answer is the same. I trust that is perfectly clear. Can we please expedite this process? I have a luncheon engagement this afternoon, and I wouldn't want to be late.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Marija. I apologize for the repetition—I just want to be thorough and ensure your wishes are documented accurately. This is the final section, and it’s about designating a healthcare proxy—someone to make medical decisions for you if you are unable to do so yourself. You've already told me that you want your husband to be your healthcare proxy, so we just need to write his name and contact information here. Could you please spell your husband’s name for me?
PATIENT: Certainly. His name is… Khalil Benhamza. B-E-N-H-A-M-Z-A. And his phone number is… 555-123-4567. He is perfectly capable of handling any medical matters, I assure you. Intelligent, resourceful, and a very sensible man. Though sometimes… overly cautious, as I’ve mentioned. But reliable nonetheless. Is that all? Is this…tortuous process finally nearing its conclusion? I do believe I am starting to feel faint. All this talk of illness and demise… it is quite draining.
DOCTOR: Alright, perfect. And thank you for confirming that information. And… that’s it, Marija. The form is complete. Here's a copy for your records. I'll also keep a copy in your chart. I know this wasn’t a pleasant experience, and I appreciate you taking the time to complete it. You’ve clearly stated your wishes, and that's what's most important. Do you have any questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I do not. And frankly, I do not anticipate needing this form ever to be utilized. I lead a very healthy life, as I’ve mentioned repeatedly. But my husband… he insists. And I find it easier to simply acquiesce to his… anxieties. Thank you for your patience, Doctor. And for expediting this… tedious process as much as possible. I believe I shall return to my luncheon engagement now. It was… a pleasure, of sorts. Though I doubt I shall be repeating this experience anytime soon.
DOCTOR: .
