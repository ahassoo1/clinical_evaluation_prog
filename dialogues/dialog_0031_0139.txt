DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Shanor. My name is Dr. Rakosky. It’s good to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Just… fitness check. For… referee work. I need paper say I okay. Quick check is good. I no want long time here.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Shanor. A fitness-for-duty examination for your referee work. I understand you'd like to keep this relatively concise. We can certainly do that. To start, can you tell me a little bit more about the requirements of the examination?
PATIENT: Requirements? I… not sure. League say need check up. Heart, maybe. And… strong? They want I not fall down when people run fast near me. I run little, not much. Mostly… stand. Is that okay? I not know what they need exactly.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Shanor. It sounds like a general physical examination with a focus on cardiovascular health and musculoskeletal strength would be appropriate. We can cover all the basics to ensure you’re fit for your duties. Let’s start with a little about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, heart problems, or anything else?
PATIENT: No. No problems. I… healthy. Always work. Hard work. Except… wife. She… sick. But me, okay. No sick. No high… what you say? Pressure. Just… tired sometimes. After work. But normal.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s good to hear that you generally feel healthy. I’m sorry to hear about your wife; that can certainly be tiring. Just to clarify, when you say tired, is that just general fatigue after a long day, or is it something more significant?
PATIENT: Just… normal tired. Long day, stand much. Legs hurt. Back hurt. But… I rest, okay. Nothing… special. I take… vitamins. Is that good? I don't know much about… vitamins. Wife buy them.
DOCTOR: That's helpful to know, Mr. Shanor. Vitamins can be a good addition to a healthy lifestyle. Do you recall the name or type of vitamins your wife purchases for you?
PATIENT: I… no remember. Small pills. Many colors. She say good for… bones. And… energy. I think. She… she know more about this. I just take them. I no ask much questions. Sorry.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all, Mr. Shanor. That’s perfectly alright. Let’s move on to any medications you currently take, aside from those vitamins. Are you on any prescriptions or over-the-counter medications regularly?
PATIENT: No. Nothing. Just… sometimes, painkiller. When back very bad. But not often. Maybe… once a month. Ibuprofen? Is that right? The blue pills. I buy at store. When I need. Not every day. Definitely not every day.
DOCTOR: Okay, ibuprofen as needed for back pain. That's good to know. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No surgery. No hospital. I… careful. I no like… doctors. Except this check up. League need. Wife… she went hospital. Long time ago. But me, no. Never. Just… small cuts from work. Nothing big. I clean, okay.
DOCTOR: Alright, no surgeries or hospitalizations. That’s good to hear. Now, let’s talk about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, diabetes, cancer, or anything else?
PATIENT: Family? My… parents gone. Long time ago. They… old. Normal old people problems. I think. They… cough much. And… weak. But I no know what problems exactly. No talk much about… sick things. My wife's family… she have… sugar problem? Diabetes? I think. But I no sure. No close. We… no see family much. Sorry. I no good with remembering.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Mr. Shanor. It’s common not to have detailed information about family medical history. We can proceed without it. Before we move on to a physical exam, are there any allergies you have – to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies. I eat everything. I… not picky. Sometimes, skin little itchy from dust at work. But not big problem. Soap help. No… medicine allergy. No food allergy. I eat spicy food. Very spicy. No problem. Wife… she allergic to cats. But me, no.
DOCTOR: Good, no known allergies. That’s helpful. Now, let's move on to a brief physical exam. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and briefly assess your range of motion. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes. Okay. Quick is good. I… have work later. Not long time, please? I… want finish quickly. Is heart first? I… worry about heart. League say strong heart important.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Shanor. We'll start with your heart, as requested. It will be quick and straightforward. Take a deep breath in… and out… Good. Your heart rate is regular and I'm not hearing any murmurs or abnormal sounds. That's a good sign. Blood pressure is 130/80, which is slightly elevated, but not significantly concerning at this time. Now, I'm just listening to your lungs. Deep breath in… and out… Everything sounds clear on both sides. No wheezing or crackling. Your pulse is strong and regular. Now, if you don't mind, I'd like to briefly check your reflexes and range of motion in your arms and legs.
PATIENT: Okay. Reflexes? Like… when doctor hit knee? I… not like that. But… okay. Quick, please. And arms first? My back… sometimes hurt when I bend. So… maybe legs after? Quick, quick. I… want finish quickly. League need paper.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Shanor. Arms first, and we’ll be as quick as possible. Good range of motion in both arms. Reflexes are normal. I am noting a slight tenderness to palpation in your lower back, particularly on the left side. Can you point to the specific area that hurts?
PATIENT: Here. Right here. Hurts when I bend. And… when I lift heavy things. Not always. Sometimes okay. Depends. Today… hurts little. Like… dull ache. Not sharp. Just… bothersome. I… take ibuprofen sometimes for this. But not every day.
DOCTOR: I understand. It feels like there's some muscle tension in that area. Now, let’s check your legs. If you’re comfortable, could you sit on the edge of the table and let your legs dangle?
PATIENT: Okay. Legs. Quick, please. I… worry about falling. Not good for referee. Need strong legs. And… quick feet. So… check quickly? Is there… anything wrong so far? I… want to know. League need paper.
DOCTOR: Your reflexes in your legs are normal, and your range of motion appears good. I'm observing no significant weakness or instability. Overall, your musculoskeletal assessment is within normal limits, with the noted tenderness in your lower back. Based on what we’ve discussed and the brief physical examination, it seems you have some mild lower back muscle strain. Your heart and lungs sound clear, and your legs are stable. Your blood pressure is slightly elevated, but likely related to stress or exertion. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No questions. So… I okay for league? I need paper. Can you write paper say I okay? Just… simple paper. League not need much detail. Just… say I fit to referee. Is that possible? Quickly, please. I… have work later.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Shanor. I can absolutely provide a note for your league stating you are medically cleared to referee. I’ll keep it concise, as you requested. Here you go. This note indicates you are cleared for referee duties with no acute medical concerns. I’ll also include a recommendation to monitor your blood pressure and to practice good back care – stretching and proper lifting techniques. I recommend scheduling a follow-up appointment with your primary care physician to discuss your blood pressure and back pain further. Would you like me to provide you with a referral to a local physician?
PATIENT: No, thank you. I have doctor. I… go see him later. This paper is good. Thank you. Quickly done. Is all? I… want go now. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Shanor. I’m glad we could get this sorted out quickly for you. Yes, that is all. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any further concerns. Have a good day, and good luck with your refereeing! .
