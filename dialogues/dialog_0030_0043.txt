DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Gibbel. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Quicksey. It’s lovely to meet you. Now, to get started, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning to you too, Doctor. Please, call me Percell. Well, it's this headache I've been having. Right in the back of my head, here… It’s been botherin’ me for a little while now, nothin’ terrible, but it just won’t go away, you know?
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand, Percell. A persistent headache can be quite bothersome. Let's try to get a better understanding of it. Could you tell me a little more about when it started?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think… It started, oh, maybe… three weeks ago? Around the end of July, I reckon. It wasn’t sudden, not like a bang, just kinda… there one morning. I was helpin’ my grandson with his garden, pullin’ weeds mostly. It didn’t hurt while I was doin’ it, just started later that day. I thought maybe it was from bein’ in the sun, but it hasn’t really gotten better with rest.
DOCTOR: Okay, three weeks ago, starting gradually, and not necessarily related to the gardening or sun exposure. That's helpful. And can you describe the headache itself?
PATIENT: Well, it's not a throbbing pain, not like what my daughter gets sometimes. More of a… dull ache, constant pressure. Feels like a tight band around the back of my head. Sometimes it feels a little stiff there too, in my neck. It's not the worst pain, but it’s always there, ya know? It makes it hard to concentrate sometimes, especially when I’m lookin’ at numbers for my clients.
DOCTOR: Yes, a dull, constant pressure with some neck stiffness. And you mentioned it interferes with your concentration, particularly when reviewing numbers for clients – do you do bookkeeping or accounting work, Percell?
PATIENT: Oh, no, not exactly. I’m a financial advisor, help people plan their savings, retirement, that sort of thing. Lots of spreadsheets, lots of lookin' at little figures. It's mostly concentration that's the issue. I can still do the work, but it takes more effort, and I get tired quicker. Feels like my brain's a little foggy, if that makes sense. Not all the time, just when I’m really focusin'.
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, Percell. A persistent headache can certainly cause that “foggy” feeling and difficulty concentrating. Now, have you noticed anything that makes the headache better or worse?
PATIENT: Hmm… that's a good question. Not really, not that I've noticed, consistently. Layin' down sometimes helps a little, but not much. Stress doesn't seem to make it worse, and neither does bein' busy, oddly enough. I drink plenty of water, I always have. Coffee doesn't seem to affect it either. It's just… there. It's pretty consistent, which is kinda what worries me, I guess. Usually, a headache has a reason, ya know?
DOCTOR: You're right to think that a headache usually has a reason, and it's good that you've noticed it's consistent. Let's talk about other symptoms. Have you experienced any nausea, vomiting, or changes in your vision—like blurry vision, seeing spots, or double vision—along with the headache?
PATIENT: No, thankfully nothin’ like that. No nausea, no throwin' up. And my vision’s been fine, as far as I can tell. I still read the newspaper every mornin’, and I haven't needed to get my glasses adjusted recently. No blurry spots, no double vision, nothin’ like that. Just the headache, and a little bit of stiffness in my neck sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to know, Percell. No nausea, vomiting, or changes in vision. Let's move on to your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any other medical conditions, such as high blood pressure, diabetes, or arthritis?
PATIENT: Well, let's see... I had a bout of pneumonia when I was younger, back in the ‘60s, but I recovered fully. And my doctor told me a few years back my cholesterol was a little high, so I try to eat healthy. Other than that, not much. No diabetes, no arthritis, nothin’ major. I've always been pretty healthy, to be honest. I walk every mornin', even in the winter.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, Percell. Being active is excellent. Have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: No, never had any surgeries. Always tried to avoid 'em if I could. My mother always said surgery was a last resort. Just a little appendix trouble when I was a boy, but that’s it. Everything else, I just got through it on my own, or with a little medicine. No broken bones, no nothin'. Mostly just aches and pains from gettin’ old, ya know?
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. No surgeries, that’s helpful to know. Now, concerning your family history, are there any relatives who have experienced frequent or severe headaches, or neurological conditions like migraines or stroke?
PATIENT: Hmm… that's a tricky one. My mother had headaches sometimes, but she mostly complained of arthritis, in her hands and knees. My father, he was a strong man, never much sick. I don’t remember anyone havin' terrible headaches, or strokes or anything like that, honestly. We didn't talk much about health stuff, back then. It wasn't somethin' we really shared. Mostly just tough it out and get on with it. I don’t think there was a lot of history of headaches in the family, but I couldn't say for sure.
DOCTOR: Okay, Percell. That gives me a good sense of your family history. Now, I’m going to ask about some medications. Are you currently taking any prescription medications, over-the-counter drugs, vitamins, or herbal supplements?
PATIENT: Just a little something for my cholesterol, a statin, I think it’s called. A small pill, once a day. And I take a multivitamin every mornin' with breakfast, just somethin’ simple. Other than that, nothin’. I don't really like takin' pills if I can avoid it. I prefer a good walk and a healthy meal, ya know? No herbal supplements, no nothin' fancy.
DOCTOR: Okay, Percell. A statin for cholesterol and a multivitamin. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope, nothin’ I know of. Never had a reaction to anythin’. I used to help my wife with her garden, and she grew all sorts of things. I ate pretty much everything she grew, and never had a problem. I don’t have any skin allergies either, not to poison ivy or anything like that. I’m pretty lucky that way, I guess.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to know, Percell. No known allergies. Now, if you don't mind, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a better understanding of what's going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine, Doctor. Go right ahead. I don't mind a little lookin' around. Hopefully, you can figure out what's botherin’ me. I just want to get back to my normal routine, helpin’ my clients and spendin’ time with my grandkids.
DOCTOR: Alright, Percell. I'm going to start by checking your blood pressure and pulse. Then, I'll listen to your heart and lungs. After that, I’ll take a look in your ears, eyes, and throat, and do a brief neurological exam to check your reflexes and strength. I’ll also gently palpate your neck and scalp. Your blood pressure is 138/82, which is a little elevated but not critically high. Pulse is 72 and regular. Your heart sounds are regular, and your lungs are clear. Your ears look normal, and your throat is clear. Your reflexes are normal and equal, and your strength is good in all your extremities. I notice some mild tenderness in the muscles at the base of your skull and in your upper neck. No obvious masses or abnormalities. Overall, the physical exam is fairly normal, but the tenderness in your neck muscles is significant. It's likely contributing to your headache.
PATIENT: Well, that’s good to hear it’s not somethin’ too serious, I suppose. The neck muscles, you say? I do spend a lot of time hunched over spreadsheets, thinkin’ about numbers… That makes sense. What do you think is causin’ the tenderness, then? And what can we do about it?
DOCTOR: It’s good that the exam didn't reveal anything alarming, Percell. The tenderness in your neck muscles is very likely due to muscle strain from prolonged sitting and working in a hunched posture. It’s a common issue, especially for people who spend a lot of time focused on close work. Given your history and the physical exam findings, it’s likely a tension headache. However, because it’s been present for three weeks and hasn’t improved with rest, I'd like to rule out other potential causes. I'd like to order some blood work, just as a precaution, to check your complete blood count and thyroid function. I also recommend a vitamin D level, as deficiency can sometimes contribute to muscle pain and headaches. Do you have any objections to having some blood drawn?
PATIENT: No, not at all. If it helps figure things out, I’m happy to have some blood drawn. I don't mind a little pinprick if it means gettin' to the bottom of this headache. Vitamin D, huh? I haven't been spendin' much time in the sun lately, workin' inside all the time. Makes sense, I reckon. Where will I go to get the blood work done?
DOCTOR: Excellent, Percell. I'll send an order to the lab here in the clinic; they'll draw the blood right here. It shouldn’t take long. I'll also give you a requisition form for the Vitamin D test. While we’re waiting for the results, I recommend a few things to help manage your symptoms. I want you to focus on improving your posture while you work. Try to sit with your back supported, shoulders relaxed, and your monitor at eye level. Taking frequent breaks to stretch your neck and shoulders will also be beneficial. Over-the-counter pain relievers, such as ibuprofen or naproxen, can help with the pain if needed, but I don't want you to rely on them long-term. We can also discuss some simple neck exercises that you can do at home to strengthen your muscles. Would you be interested in learning some of those now?
PATIENT: Yes, please, Doctor. Exercises would be great. I’d like to try somethin' to actually do about it, instead of just sittin' here feelin' sorry for myself. I’m pretty good at followin' instructions, if you show me what to do. And tellin' me what not to do is always helpful too. I don’t want to make things worse.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Percell. That’s a good attitude. Here are a few simple exercises you can do. First, neck rotations: Gently turn your head to the right, as if you're looking over your shoulder. Hold for five seconds, then slowly turn to the left. Repeat 10 times on each side. Do this slowly and gently, and stop if you feel any pain. Second, neck tilts: Gently tilt your head towards your right shoulder, trying to bring your ear closer to your shoulder. Hold for five seconds, then repeat on the left side. Repeat 10 times on each side. Again, slow and gentle movements are key. Third, chin tucks: Gently pull your chin towards your chest, as if you’re making a double chin. Hold for five seconds, then relax. Repeat 10 times. This exercise helps strengthen the deep neck muscles. Important: Avoid any exercises that cause pain. Don't force the movements. And don't push your neck beyond its comfortable range of motion. I also recommend using a warm compress on your neck and shoulders for 15-20 minutes a few times a day. Do you understand these instructions, Percell?
PATIENT: Yes, I understand. Rotations, tilts, and tucks… slow and gentle. And warm compress. No pushin’ it. Sounds manageable. I’ll try to remember that, and not overdo it. It's easy to get carried away when you're tryin’ to fix somethin’. And thanks for writin’ it down for me, Doctor. My memory isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Percell. I'm happy to write it down. It's always a good idea to have a reminder. We'll get the lab results back within a few days. Once we have those, we can discuss the next steps. If your symptoms don’t improve with these exercises and over-the-counter pain relief, or if they worsen, please don’t hesitate to call the clinic. Do you have any other questions for me at this time, Percell?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. You’ve covered everything pretty thoroughly, Doctor. I appreciate you takin’ the time to listen and explain things so clearly. It’s a relief to have a plan, even if it’s just startin’ with exercises and seein’ what the blood work says. I’ll give those exercises a try and see if they help. Thank you again, Doctor Quicksey.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Percell. I’m glad I could help. Remember, take it easy, listen to your body, and don't hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns. The nurses will be along shortly to draw your blood. Have a good day, and I’ll see you back in a few days to discuss the results.
PATIENT: It was nice meeting you too, Doctor. I’m sure I’ll be alright. Thank you again for your time.
