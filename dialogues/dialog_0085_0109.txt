DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Brum. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Devetta Lahn, and I'm a family medicine physician. It's nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Lahn. Nice to meet you too. My head... back of my head... it hurts. Been hurting for... maybe three days now? Not all the time, but it comes and goes. It's a dull ache, not a sharp pain. Like... a weight. I worked hard all my life, you know? Rail yard work. Lots of lifting. Maybe that?
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Brum. A dull ache at the back of your head for about three days, coming and going… and you're wondering if it could be related to your previous work at the rail yard?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Rail yard. Lots of heavy things. And… well, I am old now, yes? Ninety years. Things start to… not work so good. But I still try to help around the house, you know? Little things. But this headache… it’s new. It worries me a little. Never had one like this before.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Brum. It's good you're paying attention to something new. And you're right to consider your age and past work. We'll definitely try to figure out what's going on. To help me get a better picture, could you tell me a little more about the headache itself?
PATIENT: More… how to say? It comes when I am tired, I think. Or… when I bend over. Like when I pick something up from the floor. Not every time, but often. And sometimes… when I am thinking hard. Not a bad pain, but… annoying. And it does not go away easy. It stays for a long time, then goes. Then comes back. Is that… helpful?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's very helpful, Mr. Brum. So it seems to be triggered by exertion, bending, or concentration, and it lingers for a while. Does anything make it better?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. When I lie down, it feels a little better. And… when my daughter, Elena, rubs my neck. She has good hands, Elena. Very gentle. But it always comes back, even after that. I take a little nap, then it’s back again. It does not go away completely, you know? Just… less bad for a little while.
DOCTOR: Okay, lying down and Elena's neck rubs provide some relief, but it doesn’t fully resolve. And you mentioned you’re 90 years old. Have you had any other medical problems in the past – anything at all that you’ve been treated for?
PATIENT: Oh, many things. Old age brings many things! When I was younger, I broke my arm, a long time ago, working on the trains. And… I had some trouble with my stomach, many years back. The doctor gave me some pills. I don’t remember what they were called. And… my blood pressure, sometimes it gets high. Elena checks it for me. She tells me to watch the salt. But… mostly, I have been lucky. Not much trouble until now, this headache. I don't know if that helps?
DOCTOR: That’s all very helpful, Mr. Brum. So, a broken arm in the past, some stomach issues, and a history of high blood pressure that Elena monitors. Do you currently take any medications for your blood pressure, or anything else?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I take a little white pill every morning for the pressure. Elena gets it for me. I do not know the name. And… sometimes, when my joints hurt, I take a little brown pill. But not every day. Only when it’s bad. Elena says I should not take too much. She worries about me. She is a good daughter. I think that's all the pills. I don't like taking too many.
DOCTOR: Okay, a white pill daily for blood pressure and a brown pill occasionally for joint pain. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never had any allergies. I eat everything. Elena always asks, but… no allergies. I ate all kinds of things growing up in Guatemala, you know? Different fruits, different meats… never had any trouble. I think I am lucky that way too. Just this headache now. It worries me.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Mr. Brum. No known allergies. And you mentioned growing up in Guatemala. Do you have any family history of headaches or other medical problems, like heart disease or stroke?
PATIENT: Hmm… family. That is hard to remember. My father… he was a strong man, worked in the coffee fields. He did not get sick much. My mother… she had some trouble with her legs when she was old, but not headaches. My sister… she lived a long life, but I do not remember any sicknesses. We did not have doctors much, you know? We had herbs and teas. Not like now. I don't think anyone in my family had headaches like this. It’s a new thing.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known family history of similar headaches. Now, just to be thorough, could you tell me about your daily routine?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Well, I wake up around seven, Elena helps me get dressed. I eat a little breakfast - usually toast and fruit. Then I sit on the porch and watch the birds. I try to help around the house, little things, like folding laundry or bringing in the mail. I eat lunch with Elena. In the afternoon, I read the newspaper or listen to the radio. We eat dinner together. Then I watch a little television before bed. Not much excitement, you know? Quiet life. I try to rest. That's mostly it.
DOCTOR: Okay, a quiet life with a daily routine that includes rest. Now, Mr. Brum, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your reflexes, and gently feel your head and neck. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That is fine. Whatever you need. I trust you. Elena says you are a good doctor. She picked this clinic for me. Please, do what you need to do. I just want to feel better. I am a little worried, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Brum. Just relax and breathe normally. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes… [I gently test Mr. Brum's reflexes in his arms and legs.] Those seem normal as well. Now, I'm going to gently feel your head and neck for any tenderness or muscle tightness. [I carefully palpate Mr. Brum's scalp, temples, and neck muscles.] I notice some mild tenderness in the muscles at the back of your neck. Not significant, but definitely some tightness there. [Documentation: Mild tenderness to palpation of posterior cervical muscles. No lymphadenopathy noted.] Do you feel any pain or discomfort when I press here?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That… that is where it hurts. Not a sharp pain, but… a dull ache. When you press there, it feels… worse. Like a weight. Elena rubs that spot sometimes, when the headache is bad. She says my muscles are tight. But I never thought it was that bad. It’s good you feel it too, you know? It’s good to know what is wrong. Maybe that is all it is? Tight muscles?
DOCTOR: It's good we've identified that area of tenderness, Mr. Brum. It certainly seems like muscle tension in your neck is contributing to your headache. Given your age, history of rail yard work, and the characteristics of your headache, I believe this is likely a tension headache, possibly exacerbated by strain and normal age-related changes. However, to rule out other potential causes, especially given this is a new headache, I'd like to order a simple blood test to check your blood count and thyroid function. It's just a precaution. [Documentation: Order blood test: CBC, Thyroid Stimulating Hormone ] Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Blood test is fine. Whatever you think is best. Elena always says it is good to be sure. I trust you. It’s good to know what is wrong, you know? I am getting old, and things change. If a little blood test can help, then do it. It is good to be sure. Thank you, Doctor. Elena will be happy to hear we are checking things.
DOCTOR: Excellent, Mr. Brum. I'll have the lab draw the blood now. It will only take a few minutes. [I gesture to a nearby nurse.] Nurse, could you please draw a CBC and TSH for Mr. Brum?
PATIENT: Yes, thank you Doctor. I will sit here and wait. Elena said I should not eat anything for a little while, yes? Before the blood test. I hope it does not take too long. I am getting a little tired now. But I am glad we are doing this. Thank you again, Doctor. It is good to have someone listen.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's right, Mr. Brum, it's best to have an empty stomach before the blood draw. And you’re very welcome. I understand it can be tiring, and I appreciate your patience. While we wait for the results, I'm going to recommend some simple measures to help manage your headache. [Documentation: Recommend conservative management: OTC pain relievers , heat/cold packs to neck, gentle stretching exercises.] In the meantime, I suggest trying over-the-counter pain relievers like acetaminophen or ibuprofen, as long as you don't have any medical conditions that would prevent you from taking them. You can also try applying heat or cold packs to your neck muscles. And gentle stretching exercises may help relieve some of the tension. Would you like me to show you a few simple stretches?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, stretches would be good. I am not very good with exercise, you know? Old man. But I will try. Elena says I need to move more. Maybe this will help. Just simple ones, please? Not too hard. I don't want to pull anything. Thank you. It’s good to have something to do while we wait.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Brum. Nothing strenuous at all. We'll just focus on gentle movements. [I demonstrate a few simple neck stretches, including slow head rotations, chin tucks, and shoulder rolls.] Okay, so start by slowly rotating your head from side to side, as if you’re saying “no.” Just go as far as is comfortable – don’t force it. [I demonstrate.] Then, gently tuck your chin towards your chest, as if you're trying to make a double chin. [I demonstrate.] And finally, roll your shoulders forwards and backwards. [I demonstrate.] Repeat each exercise about ten times, slowly and gently. Listen to your body, and stop if you feel any pain. Would you like me to go through them with you again?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, one more time, please. My memory is not so good anymore, you know? Elena says it’s getting worse. I try to remember, but… it’s hard. Slowly, yes? And… what did you call it? “Chin tuck”? Like this? [I attempt a chin tuck, but it looks a little awkward.] Is that right? It feels… strange. But I will try to remember. Thank you, Doctor. You are very patient with an old man.
DOCTOR: That's right, Mr. Brum, a “chin tuck.” You’re doing well, just a little more subtle. Imagine you’re trying to make a double chin, but very gently. [I gently guide his chin into the correct position.] That's it! And remember, slow and steady. No need to force anything. Let’s do it together a few times. I’ll guide you. [I repeat the exercises with him, providing gentle encouragement and corrections.] And to reiterate, slow head rotations, gentle chin tucks, and shoulder rolls. Do these several times a day. It can also be helpful to maintain good posture while you’re sitting and standing. While you’re practicing those, the nurse will let me know when your blood test results are back. We'll discuss them as soon as they’re available. In the meantime, do you have any questions for me?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think I understand. Slow and gentle. Like you said. And… good posture. Elena tells me that too. She says I slouch too much. It’s good to have someone else remind me. I don't think I have any more questions right now. I just hope it's not something bad. But you seem to think it's just… muscle tension? That is good. Thank you again, Doctor. You have been very kind. And patient. I will practice the stretches and try to remember everything.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Brum. And yes, based on your history and examination, muscle tension is the most likely cause. But we’ll confirm that with the blood test results. Nurse: Doctor Lahn, Mr. Brum’s results are back. Doctor Lahn: Thank you, Nurse. [Turning back to Mr. Brum] Alright, Mr. Brum, the good news is your blood work is normal. Your blood count is within a normal range, and your thyroid function is also normal. This confirms that your headache is likely due to muscle tension, as we suspected.
PATIENT: Oh, that is good news, Doctor! Very good news. Normal blood work. That is a relief. So... just the muscles? Elena will be happy to hear that. She worries so much. Thank you, Doctor. Thank you very much. What do I do now? More stretches? And... should I take anything for the pain? I don't want to take too many pills. But sometimes it hurts, you know?
