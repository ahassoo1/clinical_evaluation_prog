DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. McKinnon. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Talen Delacour. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Please, call me Edric. Well, it’s… my muscles, mostly. They feel weak. It’s been happening for a little while now, and it’s starting to worry me.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Edric. Weakness in the muscles, you said. And how long has this been going on for, approximately?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It started maybe… six, seven weeks ago? At first, I just thought I was tired from work, you know? Long hours inspecting cars and all. But it hasn’t gone away, and it's actually getting a bit worse, if I'm honest. I noticed it more when I was helping my cousin move some boxes last weekend. Really struggled with it.
DOCTOR: I understand. So, it began gradually over six to seven weeks, initially attributed to work-related fatigue, but has since progressed and is now noticeably impacting your ability to perform tasks, such as lifting during your cousin's move. Could you describe the weakness more specifically?
PATIENT: Yeah, that's about right. It's... not like I can't do things, it's just… harder. It feels like my arms and legs are heavier than they should be. And it’s not really painful, just… sluggish. Like trying to move through water. It’s mostly in my limbs, hasn't really affected my face or anything. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that clarifies things considerably. Weakness primarily in your arms and legs, a sensation of heaviness and sluggishness, but without pain, and not affecting your facial muscles. Have you noticed any other symptoms accompanying this weakness?
PATIENT: Let me think… now that you mention it, I have been feeling more tired than usual, even when I get enough sleep. And… this is a bit strange, but sometimes my hands feel a little shaky. It’s not constant, just… comes and goes. Oh, and I’ve been a little thirsty lately, more so than normal. I didn't think much of it, just figured it was the weather.
DOCTOR: Okay, so we're now noting increasing fatigue, intermittent tremors in your hands, and increased thirst alongside the muscle weakness. Do you have any difficulty with swallowing or changes in your vision?
PATIENT: No, no trouble swallowing at all. And my vision is fine, I think. I wear glasses for reading, but that hasn’t changed. Actually, now that I think about it, I have been going to the bathroom more often, especially at night. It’s not a huge amount each time, just… more frequent. Is that important? I haven't mentioned it to anyone before.
DOCTOR: Yes, that is important information, Edric. Increased urinary frequency, particularly at night, adds another piece to the puzzle. To get a more complete picture, could you tell me a bit about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Not much to tell, really. I had the usual childhood stuff – chickenpox, measles, that sort of thing. Broke my arm when I was a kid, but that healed fine. No serious illnesses, never been hospitalized. No surgeries. I don’t take any regular medications, just over-the-counter pain relievers sometimes for aches and pains, like ibuprofen. And… I don’t have any allergies that I know of. I wish I had something to tell you, honestly. It's frustrating not knowing what’s going on.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Edric. A lack of significant past medical history is helpful information as well. Now, regarding your family history – are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… my father had high blood pressure, and he had diabetes later in life, but he lived to be 85, so I guess it wasn’t too bad. My mother… she had some arthritis in her hands, but nothing major. My older brother is healthy as a horse, as far as I know. And my cousins… nothing that I'm aware of. We don't really talk about that stuff much, if I'm honest. It’s a bit of a taboo topic in my family.
DOCTOR: I see. A family history of hypertension, diabetes, and arthritis. Now, let's briefly discuss your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, no smoking. Never been a smoker. I have a beer or a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, maybe two or three times a week. Nothing heavy. And absolutely no drugs. Never touched them, never will. I try to eat pretty healthy, mostly. Lots of vegetables, rice, and fish. Yemeni food, you know? It's usually good for you. I work a lot, though, so I don't always have time to cook. That's probably the worst part of it all.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Edric. That provides a good overview. Given your symptoms – the progressive muscle weakness, fatigue, tremors, increased thirst and urinary frequency – and your medical and family history, I'd like to conduct a physical examination. I'll start by checking your vital signs – blood pressure, pulse, and temperature – and then perform a neurological exam to assess your muscle strength, reflexes, and coordination. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good, Doctor. Anything to figure out what’s going on. Let’s get it done. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me. It's been worrying me quite a bit.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Alright, let's start with your vital signs. Please extend your arm. Your blood pressure is 138/82, your pulse is 76 and regular, and your temperature is 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take deep breaths in and out. Your heart and lungs sound clear. Now, let's move on to the neurological exam. Could you please sit up and I will test your muscle strength?
PATIENT: Okay, sounds good. Whatever you need me to do, Doctor. Just let me know. I'm ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Thank you. I'm going to ask you to resist as I push down on your arms. Please push back with the same force as you can. Your biceps strength is 5 out of 5 on both sides, which is normal. Your triceps strength is also 5 out of 5 bilaterally. Your wrist strength is 4 out of 5 on both sides – a little bit weaker than normal, but not significantly. Now let's move on to your legs. Could you extend your legs out for me?
PATIENT: Okay, no problem. A little weak, maybe? But I'll try my best. Let me know if I need to adjust anything.
DOCTOR: Thank you. Your quadriceps strength is 4 out of 5 bilaterally – again, a little weaker than normal. Your hamstring strength is also 4 out of 5 on both sides. Your ankle strength is 3 out of 5 bilaterally, which is noticeably weaker. Now, let's test your reflexes. I'm going to tap on your knees and ankles with this little hammer. Your knee reflexes are 2+ bilaterally, which is normal. Your ankle reflexes are 1+ bilaterally, which is a little bit diminished. Finally, let's check your coordination. Could you please touch your finger to your nose with your eyes closed?
PATIENT: Okay. It’s a little shaky, Doctor. Not as smooth as it usually is. It's harder to do with my eyes closed.
DOCTOR: Yes, I noticed that. It's a little bit uncoordinated, and your movements are slightly shaky. Based on the physical examination – the reduced muscle strength in your legs, diminished ankle reflexes, and slight incoordination – along with your reported symptoms, I'm concerned about possible neuromuscular weakness. However, these findings are not definitive. To investigate further, I’d like to order some blood tests. Specifically, I want to check your complete blood count, electrolytes, kidney function, liver function, thyroid function, and vitamin D levels. I also want to check your creatine kinase level, which is an enzyme released when there’s muscle damage. And finally, I want to check your A1C level to assess your average blood sugar over the past three months. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds… thorough. If it’ll help figure out what’s going on, absolutely. Whatever tests you think are necessary, Doctor. I just want to know what I’m dealing with. What’s the next step after the blood tests? How long will it take to get the results? And… is it something serious? I know you probably can’t tell me for sure yet, but… is it something I should be really worried about? I apologize for asking so many questions.
DOCTOR: You're not asking too many questions, Edric. It's perfectly normal to be concerned and want answers. The blood tests will help us rule out several possibilities, including vitamin deficiencies, thyroid problems, kidney or liver dysfunction, and underlying infections. The creatine kinase level will help us assess if there’s active muscle damage. The A1C level will check for diabetes, which can sometimes cause muscle weakness. The lab typically takes 24 to 48 hours to process these tests. Once the results are available, we will schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them in detail. It’s too early to say definitively whether it’s something serious. The symptoms you’re describing could be due to a number of different conditions, some of which are more concerning than others. Until we have the results of the blood tests, it’s difficult to say for sure. However, given your symptoms and the physical exam findings, it's important that we investigate further. To be on the safe side, I will also order a urinalysis to check for any signs of kidney problems or infection. And given the intermittent tremors and increased thirst, I'd like to discuss a glucose tolerance test in our follow-up, should the A1C level be abnormal. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding strenuous activity and staying well-hydrated. If you experience any worsening of your symptoms – such as difficulty breathing, swallowing, or speaking – or develop a fever, please seek immediate medical attention. Do you have any allergies to contrast dye or any kidney problems?
PATIENT: No allergies to anything, Doctor, as far as I know. And no kidney problems, not that I'm aware of. My family doesn't have a history of kidney issues, either. Okay, so… no strenuous activity, stay hydrated, and watch out for anything getting worse. I can do that. Is there anything else I should be doing in the meantime? Should I be taking any vitamins or supplements? Or changing my diet in any way? I just want to be proactive, you know? I appreciate you explaining everything so thoroughly. It helps calm my nerves a little.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Edric. I understand wanting to be proactive. For now, I wouldn't recommend starting any new vitamins or supplements until we have the results of the blood tests. Some supplements can interfere with the results, and we want to get an accurate picture of your current health status. In terms of diet, I recommend continuing to eat a healthy, balanced diet with plenty of fruits, vegetables, and lean protein. Staying well-hydrated is also important, as we discussed. Avoid excessive sugar and processed foods. Regarding your concerns, I want to reassure you that we are taking this seriously and are doing everything we can to get to the bottom of it. I also want to emphasize that it’s important to follow up with me as soon as you have the lab results. I will give you a lab requisition form. Please take it to the lab as soon as possible. Do you have any questions before we finish?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything, Doctor. Thank you. Really, thank you for listening and taking the time to explain everything so clearly. I appreciate it more than you know. I’ll get the blood work done right away. I’ll be sure to schedule a follow-up appointment as soon as I get the results. Hopefully, it's nothing too serious. Thanks again. I think that’s all. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Edric. I’m glad I could help. Please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any concerns or questions before your follow-up appointment. We’ll do our best to get to the bottom of this. Take care, and I look forward to seeing you soon.
