DOCTOR: Good morning, Mirriam. It’s lovely to meet you. I’m Dr. Bombara. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor! It's nice to meet you as well. Well, it's these hiccups, you see. Been going on for… oh, goodness, I'd say about three days now. Quite annoying, really. Not painful, just… persistent.
DOCTOR: Three days of hiccups, alright. Persistent hiccups can be bothersome, certainly. And no pain associated with them, you said?
PATIENT: That’s right, no pain at all. Just… hic… this! It happens every few minutes, maybe? Sometimes more often if I try to drink something quickly, or get a bit excited. Though, excitement shouldn't be causing this, should it?
DOCTOR: It can happen with excitement, yes, though usually it resolves quickly. Let’s try to get a better understanding of what might be going on. Can you tell me a bit about what you were doing around the time the hiccups first started?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… around three days ago… Hmm. Well, my grandson, little Josaia, he came to visit. He's just turned five, and he’s full of energy. We were building a fort in the garden, and I was down on my knees, helping him with the blankets and branches… lots of bending and lifting, I suppose. And I had a fizzy drink with him – guava flavored, his favorite! Could that have something to do with it?
DOCTOR: Building a fort, bending and lifting… and a fizzy drink. Okay. Sometimes hiccups can be triggered by changes in pressure in the abdomen, or even by irritation to the diaphragm. The guava drink is interesting – carbonation could definitely play a role. Have you noticed if anything else seems to bring them on, or make them worse?
PATIENT: That's a good point about the pressure, I hadn't thought of that! No, not really… except maybe when I laugh. A good chuckle always sets them off. And if I try to hold my breath, it feels even worse, makes me need to cough. Though I wouldn’t say coughing causes them, it’s just what happens when I try to stop them. Everything just feels a bit… off, but I can’t put my finger on it.
DOCTOR: Laughing and holding your breath… alright. And you mentioned feeling a bit “off.” Can you describe that feeling for me?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s hard to explain. Not unwell, exactly. Just… a bit fluttery, maybe? Like a little bit of indigestion, but not painful. And I feel a bit more tired than usual, though I’ve always been a bit of a napper, you see. It’s not a bad tired, just… more inclined to sit down with a cup of tea than usual. Old age, probably! But I thought I'd best get it checked, just in case.
DOCTOR: It's always wise to get things checked out, regardless of age. That fluttery feeling and increased tiredness… alright. Before we move on to a quick examination, let me ask about any other symptoms you've noticed. Have you had any nausea, vomiting, heartburn, or difficulty swallowing?
PATIENT: No, none of those, thankfully. No nausea, definitely no vomiting, and my heartburn is usually pretty well controlled with a little bit of papaya after dinner. And swallowing is perfectly fine. I can eat my usual meals without any trouble, even a good hearty plate of kokoda! I wouldn’t want to miss that! Just the hiccups and this little bit of tiredness, really. And the fluttery feeling. It's mostly just bothersome, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mirriam. It sounds like we have a fairly clear picture, but let’s just do a quick physical examination, just to rule out anything else. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, and then I’ll take a quick look at your abdomen. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, that's perfectly alright. Go right ahead, Doctor. I’ve had plenty of poking and prodding in my time, you see. I used to help out at the hospital back home, so I'm used to it! Don't worry, I won't bite. Just let me know if anything feels uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear! It always makes things easier when a patient is comfortable. Alright, if you could just lie back for me… I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs first. Just breathe normally. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs noted. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Now, I'm going to gently palpate your abdomen. Let me know if anything is tender or painful. No tenderness to palpation noted, abdomen is soft. No masses detected. Everything feels normal.
PATIENT: That was lovely, thank you, Doctor. Everything felt perfectly normal to me, you were very gentle. So, what do you think it is? Is it something serious? I’m not too worried, but one always wonders, you see. Perhaps it is just old age catching up with me!
DOCTOR: Well, Mirriam, based on what you've told me and the physical examination, it doesn't appear to be anything serious at this time. Given the timing of the hiccups starting after helping your grandson build a fort, the fizzy drink, and the associated feeling of being a bit fluttery, it's most likely a combination of things—possibly some mild diaphragmatic irritation from the exertion and bending, combined with a little bit of gas from the carbonated drink. The tiredness is likely unrelated, and could be just as you said – a bit of normal aging! However, hiccups that persist for more than 48 hours can sometimes indicate an underlying medical issue, albeit rarely. To be on the safe side, I would like to order a basic blood test to check your electrolyte levels, and a simple chest X-ray to rule out any lung irritation. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: That sounds perfectly reasonable, Doctor. I’d rather be safe than sorry, you see. Blood test and a chest X-ray… yes, that’s fine. No trouble at all. And thank you for explaining it all so clearly. I feel much better already, just knowing it’s probably nothing serious. How quickly can we get those tests done? And will they make me feel any worse? I’m rather fond of my naps, you see!
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mirriam. I’m glad I could reassure you. The blood test is very straightforward – a simple draw of a few vials. And the chest X-ray is quick and painless – you’ll just stand or sit in front of the machine for a few moments. Neither should disrupt your naps! I’ll write the orders now, and the nurses will schedule those for you. I expect we’ll have the results back within a few days. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding fizzy drinks, and try to take things a bit easier—no strenuous fort-building for a little while! Is there anything else I can address for you today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything, Doctor. Thank you so much for your time and patience. You’ve been very kind and thorough. No strenuous fort-building… my grandson will be disappointed! But he’s a clever boy, he’ll find something else to keep me busy. I appreciate you taking such good care of me. Perhaps a good cup of tea and a nap are in order while we wait for the results!
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mirriam. It was a pleasure meeting you. And a good cup of tea and a nap sound like an excellent plan. I’ll have the nurses print out the test orders, and they’ll let you know when everything is scheduled. Don't hesitate to call the clinic if you experience any new or worsening symptoms. We’ll be in touch once the results are back. Have a lovely day, and get some rest.
PATIENT: It was lovely meeting you too, Doctor Bombara. Thank you again for everything. I will, I certainly will. I have a feeling a lovely day is just what I need! .
