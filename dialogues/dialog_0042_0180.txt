DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Cantoran. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Vodzak. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Ugh, finally. Look, I don't have all day, Doc. Just…tired. Real tired. And…I eat dirt now. Not a lot, but…clay. From the garden. Don't judge me. It just…feels good. I don't know why, okay? Is that enough?
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Cantoran. Thank you for being upfront with me. "Real tired" and… consuming clay. We can definitely explore both of those things. Let's start with the tiredness. Can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Explore? Look, I program machines. It's…precise work. Requires focus. Been doing it a long time. It’s just getting…harder. Like, I fall asleep sitting up. Sometimes I forget what I was doing even while I'm doing it. My husband…well, he used to help me remember things. Now…it's just me. And the naps. Lots of naps. Is that what you need to know?
DOCTOR: Okay, so fatigue that interferes with your work, and some memory lapses…even during tasks. And this has been happening gradually, you said?
PATIENT: Gradually? I don't know. Time…blurs. It just…felt like it started getting worse after…after he passed. A lot of things got blurry then. He was good at keeping track of things. Bills, appointments, what I ate for lunch… everything. Now I just…do things and hope for the best. Does that make sense? Honestly, I just want to feel normal again. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: No, Ms. Cantoran, that doesn't sound like too much to ask at all. And yes, that makes perfect sense. Losing someone can disrupt everything, even the seemingly small things. It’s completely understandable that things would feel…off after such a loss. Let's talk a little more about this fatigue. Is it constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Ugh, constant. Like a weight. Always there. Some days worse than others, sure. But never gone. It’s not just sleepy, either. It’s…everything feels heavy. Moving, thinking, even talking. And…sometimes I get these headaches. Dull, throbbing ones. They don't really go away with pills, either. Just…less bad for a little while. Is that helpful? I don't know what you want to know.
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Cantoran, this is very helpful. “A sense of heaviness” is a good way to describe it. And the headaches that don't respond to over-the-counter medication are important to note. Now, about the clay… how often are you consuming it, and roughly how much at a time?
PATIENT: Honestly? I try not to. My daughter…she gives me looks. But when I’m really tired, when that heavy feeling is the worst…a few mouthfuls. It’s…hard to explain. It feels…cool. Soothing, almost. From the garden, mostly. Red clay. Just a little bit. I don’t want to make a mess, okay? It's not like I’m eating buckets of it! Once a week, maybe? Sometimes more, sometimes less. Depends. Is that disgusting? I knew you'd think that was disgusting.
DOCTOR: Ms. Cantoran, I appreciate you being so open with me. It's not about judging, it's about understanding what's going on. And no, it’s not necessarily "disgusting." There are certain conditions where people crave non-food items – it's called pica. It can sometimes indicate a nutritional deficiency. Let's talk about your diet generally. What does a typical day of eating look like for you?
PATIENT: Ugh, diet. Look, I'm a busy woman. I don't have time for fancy cooking. Mostly…whatever's quick. Cereal. Sandwiches. Leftovers if I remember to make them. Sometimes I skip meals entirely. Been doing that more lately. Not hungry, I guess. My daughter tries to get me to eat better, but…it's just easier this way. I drink coffee, lots of coffee. Does that count? I don't really pay attention to…vitamins or anything. Why would I?
DOCTOR: Okay, quick meals, skipping meals, and a lot of coffee. I understand that it can be hard to prioritize healthy eating when you’re busy. Ms. Cantoran, have you ever been told you were anemic, or low in iron?
PATIENT: Anemic? Iron? I don't know. Doctors…I don’t really go to the doctor much. He…my husband, he took care of all that. Appointments, tests, remembering what they said…I just went along. Never paid attention to the details. I think…maybe one doctor mentioned something about being a little tired, a long time ago. But he just said I needed more sleep. Honestly, I don't remember. Does that help? I’m terrible at this, aren’t I?
DOCTOR: You’re not terrible at all, Ms. Cantoran. It’s perfectly understandable, especially given everything you’ve been through. It sounds like your husband handled most of your medical care. Okay. I’d like to do a quick physical exam, and then I think it would be a good idea to order some blood work. That will help us get a clearer picture of what's going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. Get it over with. I have things to do. Machines don’t program themselves, you know. And honestly, I'm just tired of talking about it. Just…tell me when it's done. The sooner the better.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Cantoran. If you'll just have a seat here. We'll start with your blood pressure and pulse. Your blood pressure is 130/85, and your pulse is 72. A little on the higher side, but not concerning at this moment. Now, I'd like to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a few deep breaths for me. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs noted. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Your abdomen is soft, non-tender. No masses palpated. I’m just going to check your reflexes quickly…and some basic coordination. Reflexes are 2+ and equal bilaterally. Coordination is intact. No obvious neurological deficits noted at this time. Alright, Ms. Cantoran. That concludes the physical exam. Now, I’ll order the blood work. That will include a complete blood count, iron studies, thyroid function tests, and a basic metabolic panel. It will help us rule out some of the more common causes of fatigue and assess your overall health. Is there anything you would like to ask me before we proceed?
PATIENT: Thyroid? What’s that got to do with anything? Look, all I want is to feel normal again. Will this blood work tell me why I'm so tired? And…will it tell me if I need to stop eating dirt? Because my daughter is going to kill me if she finds out I’m still doing that. Honestly, just…get it over with. The sooner I know, the sooner I can go back to work.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Cantoran. The thyroid gland regulates your metabolism, and sometimes an underactive thyroid can cause fatigue and other symptoms. It’s just one thing we need to check to rule out potential causes. The blood work will give us a much clearer picture of what's going on. It will help us determine if there’s an underlying medical reason for your fatigue, and whether there are any nutritional deficiencies that could be contributing to your cravings. I’ve submitted the orders to the lab. You should receive a call within 24-48 hours to schedule an appointment to have your blood drawn. Once the results are back, we’ll review them together and discuss a plan of action. In the meantime, I would suggest trying to focus on getting as much rest as possible, and trying to incorporate some easily digestible foods into your diet. And while it’s understandable that the clay provides some temporary relief, it's best to avoid it if possible until we have the results of the blood work. I realize this is difficult, but it will help us get a clearer picture of what's going on. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Easy digestible foods? What does that even mean? Look, Doc, I program machines. I don’t have time for fancy diets and…and feeling. I just want a solution. Will this blood work give me a solution? That's all I care about. And…don't tell my daughter I was here. She worries too much. Honestly, just…get me out of here. I have things to do. .
DOCTOR: I understand your desire for a quick solution, Ms. Cantoran. The blood work is a crucial step in finding answers. As for "easily digestible foods," I simply mean foods that don't require a lot of effort for your body to process – things like soup, yogurt, or cooked vegetables. I have noted your request regarding your daughter. Your medical information is confidential and will not be shared without your explicit consent. Alright. I will have the lab call you to schedule your blood draw. Please don’t hesitate to contact the office if you have any questions or concerns. It was nice meeting you, Ms. Cantoran. I hope you feel better soon. .
