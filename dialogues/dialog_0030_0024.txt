DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Sayar. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Quicksey. It's nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. I need a letter confirming I'm able to fly. It’s… a bit complicated, but my travel insurance company requires it before they’ll approve my trip. I lost my husband six months ago, and I'm finally trying to get away for a bit, you see? It’s to Mongolia, to be with family.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Sayar. That sounds like a very significant trip, and I'm happy to help facilitate that for you. I'm very sorry for your loss. Losing a husband is incredibly difficult. To write this letter, I'll need to ensure it's medically appropriate for you to travel. Could you tell me a little bit about your overall health?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. It is significant. And yes, it’s been… hard. As for my health, well, I'm generally quite healthy, I think. I’m 176 centimeters tall and weigh about 131 pounds. I don't have any ongoing illnesses, no diabetes or heart problems or anything like that. I do have Medicare, if that’s helpful? I haven’t seen a doctor regularly since… well, since he got sick, to be honest. I keep pretty active though, mostly walking. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Ms. Sayar. Thank you for sharing that with me. And knowing you have Medicare is helpful for billing purposes. It's good to hear you're active; that's excellent. Just to be thorough, could you tell me about any allergies you have – to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies, Doctor. Nothing at all. I've always been pretty lucky that way. I can eat anything, take most medications without issue... honestly, I can’t think of a single thing. I've never had a reaction to anything. Is there anything else you need to know? I'm trying to get this letter sorted quickly, if that’s alright. The travel agent is already asking for updates.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful to hear, Ms. Sayar. No known allergies is very helpful. I understand your urgency; we’ll do our best to get this letter completed promptly. To ensure I can confidently write this letter, could you briefly tell me about any medications you are currently taking, even over-the-counter ones or vitamins?
PATIENT: Nothing at all, Doctor. Not even vitamins. He – my husband – always handled all of that, and… I haven’t really gotten back into a routine since. I haven't needed anything. I just take a multivitamin occasionally, if that counts, but it’s not regular. Really, that’s it. I promise. I'm not one for taking pills.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Sayar, that’s good to know. To complete the picture, could you tell me about any significant past medical or surgical history?
PATIENT: Nothing significant, Doctor. I had my tonsils out when I was a child, but that was decades ago and there were no complications. Otherwise, I’ve always been very healthy, thankfully. No serious illnesses, no surgeries... just the usual childhood things, you know? A few broken bones when I was little, but nothing that would affect my ability to fly now. I really haven’t been to a doctor much over the years.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear, Ms. Sayar. No significant past medical or surgical history is helpful information. Now, can you tell me about your family’s medical history?
PATIENT: Well… my mother had high blood pressure when she got older, and my father… he had some heart trouble in his seventies, but he lived a long life. On my husband’s side, his father had diabetes, but it was managed with diet and exercise. Nothing major, really. A lot of common things, I suppose. Is that the sort of thing you need to know? I’m not sure how detailed you need me to be.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's exactly the sort of thing I need to know, Ms. Sayar. It’s helpful to get a general picture. Now, to get a better understanding of your current health status, can you describe if you've been experiencing any symptoms recently – anything at all, even if it seems minor?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, nothing at all. Honestly, that’s why I haven't been to see anyone. I feel perfectly fine. A little tired, maybe, from everything that's happened, but nothing physical. No pain, no shortness of breath, no dizziness… just a bit stressed about the trip, if I’m being honest. But that’s not a medical symptom, is it? I really think I’m alright. Can we just get the letter written, please?
DOCTOR: I understand your desire to simply get the letter, Ms. Sayar, and I appreciate you sharing all of this with me. However, to ensure I can write a responsible and accurate letter for your travel insurance, I would like to perform a brief physical exam. It's a standard procedure, and it will only take a few minutes. We'll check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and just do a quick overall assessment. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Fine, Doctor. If you really think it’s necessary. But please be quick. I have a lot to arrange for the trip and the travel agent is getting impatient. I really don't want to spend the whole day here. Blood pressure and… listening? Alright. Just… please be gentle. I haven’t been to a doctor in a long time.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Sayar. I’ll be as quick and gentle as possible. Let’s start with your blood pressure. Please extend your arm for me. Your blood pressure is 128/76, which is within a normal range. Now, if you’ll just sit back, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs with my stethoscope. Your heart sounds regular and lungs are clear. Do you have any pain or discomfort when I press here?
PATIENT: No pain, Doctor. That feels… normal. You’re not hurting me, if that’s what you’re asking. Just… it’s been a while since anyone has listened to my chest. Everything feels alright. Can we just get the letter now? I really need to go. The flight is getting closer and I haven’t even started packing yet.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Sayar. Everything sounds and looks good. Based on what you've told me and the brief physical exam, I don't see any medical contraindications to you traveling to Mongolia. I’m composing a letter stating that you are medically cleared for air travel, and that, to the best of my knowledge, you have no pre-existing conditions that would prevent you from flying. I will also include a brief statement about your recent physical examination findings. It will be ready in a few minutes. Do you have any questions for me while I finish this up?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don’t think so. Just… thank you. Thank you for being so quick and understanding. I really appreciate it. I just want to get home, or… to Mongolia. To my family. Is there anything I need to pay before I leave? I really wasn’t expecting this to take so long.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Sayar. I understand the importance of this trip to you and I'm glad I could help. Here is the letter. Please review it to make sure all the information is correct. Let me see… Medicare covers the office visit today, so there is no cost to you. You may receive a statement for the visit for your records, but you shouldn't have any out-of-pocket expenses. Do you have any other questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think that's everything. Thank you again, so much. You’ve been very kind. I really appreciate your help. I should probably get going. Lots to do before the flight. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Sayar. I wish you safe travels and a peaceful visit with your family. Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns once you arrive in Mongolia. Have a wonderful trip.
