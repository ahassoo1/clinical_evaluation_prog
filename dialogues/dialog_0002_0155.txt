DOCTOR: Hi Lyman, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Ranjan. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Uh, yes, hello Doctor. It’s… well, it’s my hands. They shake. Been shaking, I guess. Not a good thing, you know? I don’t… I don’t really know why they shake, just that they do. It’s been going on… a while now. A long while.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Your hands have been shaking for a while now. That can be concerning, and it's good you came in to get it checked out. When you say "a while," could you give me a rough estimate?
PATIENT: Rough… oh, goodness. Years, I suppose. Maybe… five years? Six? It started small, I think. Just a little quiver. Now… well, now it’s harder to hold things. Pouring coffee is… a challenge. I don’t remember exactly when it started, though. My memory isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Okay, five or six years – that's helpful. And it’s gradually gotten worse, making things like pouring coffee difficult. You mentioned your memory isn't what it used to be. Has that memory issue been developing around the same time as the shaking, or is that a separate issue?
PATIENT: Separate, I think. The memory… it’s been going downhill for longer, honestly. Years and years. The shaking… that’s newer. Relatively. I… I don’t know if that makes sense. Everything just kind of… blurs together after a while, you know? I used to be able to remember dates, names… everything. Now… not so much. It’s frustrating, to be honest.
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense, Lyman. It's common for things to feel blurry as time goes on. So, to clarify, the memory problems have been longer-standing, and the hand shaking is more recent, developing over the last five or six years. Have you noticed the shaking getting worse at certain times of the day, or with specific activities besides pouring coffee?
PATIENT: Hmm. Specific… well, it’s worse when I’m trying to be precise, I think. Like… using tools. I used to be good with my hands, fixing things around the house. Now, I avoid it. Too shaky. And… sometimes when I’m nervous. Or stressed. It’s hard to say exactly when it gets worse. Just… seems to happen more when I’m concentrating hard. Or worried. Does that… help?
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful, Lyman. So, it seems to be aggravated by tasks requiring precision, and also by stress or nervousness. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the shaking?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… Oh, goodness. Let me see… I feel… tired sometimes. More tired than I used to. And… my legs feel a little stiff. Not all the time, but sometimes when I walk, they just… don’t move as smoothly. I thought it was just old age, to be honest. I haven’t really told anyone about it, though. It just… comes and goes.
DOCTOR: Okay, fatigue and some stiffness in your legs, coming and going. I appreciate you sharing that. Now, let's talk a little about your medical history. Do you have any medical conditions that you’ve been diagnosed with, like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: High blood pressure, yes. The doctor told me years ago. I… I think I take pills for it. Or, I used to. I can’t quite remember which ones. My daughter used to keep track of it all for me. She… she doesn’t live nearby anymore. And… nothing else, I don’t think. I haven’t been to the doctor in… a long time. Honestly, I mostly just try to avoid them. Everything feels like a hassle.
DOCTOR: Okay, high blood pressure, treated in the past with medication, but you’re not sure what medication or if you're still taking it currently. And you haven’t been to the doctor in quite a while. Do you have any allergies to medications or anything else, like foods or pollen?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. Never had any reactions to anything, as far as I remember. My wife… she always did the remembering. Everything feels like a blur, you know? It’s… frustrating. I just want to know what’s wrong with my hands. Is it serious? Am I going to fall apart?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Lyman, and it's completely valid to feel overwhelmed. It's okay to feel this way. We’ll figure this out together. It’s good you came in, and we'll work towards understanding what's going on with your hands. Before we proceed, let me just quickly check your chart to see what information we have on file regarding your blood pressure. One moment.
PATIENT: Fine. Just… please be quick. I have an appointment to… well, I can’t quite remember what it is. But it’s important. Or, I think it is.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lyman, I've pulled up your records. It looks like you were diagnosed with hypertension about 10 years ago, and you were prescribed lisinopril. The last recorded refill was about 5 years ago, so it appears you haven't been consistently taking it. Now, to get a better understanding of what’s going on, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. I’ll check your reflexes, your muscle tone, and coordination. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. Just… please be gentle. My hands… they’re already shaky enough. I don’t want to make it worse. Let’s just get this over with. Is there… is there anything wrong with my brain? I’ve been forgetting things lately. Is that connected to the shaking?
DOCTOR: Okay, Lyman, we’ll be as gentle as possible. And it's good you brought up the memory issues - it’s important to consider all aspects of your health. We’ll assess everything. It's possible the shaking and memory issues could be connected, but we need to rule out other causes first. Okay, if you could just extend your arms out in front of you, please. And relax your hands. Alright, let's see… Observes hands for tremors I'm noting a resting tremor in both hands. Now, let's check your reflexes… Tests reflexes in both arms and legs Reflexes are a bit diminished, but within normal limits. Now, could you touch your nose with your index finger, and then touch my finger?
PATIENT: Like this? It’s… harder than it looks, Doctor. It’s… it’s getting worse just trying to do this. My hands… they won’t cooperate. I used to be so steady. Now, I can barely hold a glass of water. It’s embarrassing. Maybe… maybe it’s just old age.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lyman, I see what you mean. It is becoming more challenging. And it’s understandable to feel frustrated. It’s definitely not just old age, and we need to investigate further. Alright, if you could stand up for me, please. And try to walk a few steps. Just a normal walk. I'm going to watch your gait and see how steady you are. Observes Lyman's walking, noting a slightly shuffling gait and some balance issues. I see a slightly wider stance and a little bit of a shuffling gait. Your balance seems a little unsteady as well. Now, I'd like to listen to your heart and lungs, and check your blood pressure. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Fine. It’s… harder than it used to be. I feel… off balance. My legs… they just don’t feel as strong anymore. Go ahead, Doctor. Do what you need to do. Just… hurry up, please.
DOCTOR: Alright, Lyman. Your heart sounds regular, and lungs are clear. Your blood pressure is elevated, 160/95. That's higher than it should be. Okay, based on the exam, we have a resting tremor, slightly shuffling gait, unsteady balance, diminished reflexes, and elevated blood pressure. Given your age, symptoms, and exam findings, the most likely possibility is Parkinson’s Disease, but we need to rule out other causes. I'm going to order some blood work to check for other potential causes of tremor, and I'd like to schedule an MRI of your brain to get a better look at what’s going on. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Parkinson’s…? Oh, goodness. Is that… is that bad? My… my neighbor had that. He… he ended up in a wheelchair. No. No, I don’t want that. Is there… is there anything you can do? Pills? Something? I just want my hands to stop shaking. And… I don’t want to end up in a wheelchair. What about the MRI? Will that… hurt? I don't like being in small spaces.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Lyman, and it’s completely normal to feel anxious when you hear a possible diagnosis. It's important to remember that Parkinson's Disease affects everyone differently, and not everyone ends up in a wheelchair. There are treatments available that can help manage the symptoms and improve your quality of life. We're not confirming a diagnosis yet, just exploring possibilities. The MRI will help us rule out other causes, like stroke or brain tumor. It's a painless procedure – you'll be lying on a table inside a large magnet, and it takes about 30-40 minutes. If you're claustrophobic, we can give you something to help you relax beforehand. I’m going to order the blood work now. We will need to schedule the MRI. I'll also write you a prescription for medication to help lower your blood pressure. Lowering your blood pressure can sometimes help with tremors as well. I'm also going to give you a referral to a neurologist – they are specialists in disorders of the brain and nervous system, and they can provide a more definitive diagnosis and treatment plan. Would that be alright with you?
