DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Ruocco. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. StHilaire. It’s a pleasure to meet you. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Hmm... what brings me in? Well, it’s my chest, I think. Hurts when I… when I take a deep breath. It’s been going on for a little while now. Not sure exactly how long, to be honest. Everything’s a bit fuzzy these days.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Ruocco. It’s perfectly alright if the timing isn’t precise. “A little while now” is a good starting point. Could you describe the pain for me?
PATIENT: Describe it... It's not a sharp pain, not like when I fell off the roof helping with the shingles years ago. More like… a dull ache. Deep inside. And it gets worse when I try to fill my lungs, you know? Like something’s pulling. It doesn't hurt all the time, just when I… breathe deep. Does that make sense? I'm not very good at explaining these things.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Mr. Ruocco. A dull ache that worsens with deep breaths. Thank you for clarifying. Now, does this pain radiate anywhere—meaning, does it spread to your arm, back, or neck?
PATIENT: Radiate…? Hmm… let me think. No, not really. It mostly stays right here, in the middle of my chest. Sometimes, maybe a little bit in my back, but not much. Mostly just… here. I don’t think it goes down my arm or up to my neck. No, not that I remember, anyway. Things are… tricky with remembering these days.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Ruocco. It’s alright if your recall isn’t perfect. Staying focused on the chest pain itself is most important right now. Aside from the pain, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… Well, I do get a little more tired than usual, maybe. But I’m eighty years old, so… Hard to tell what’s just old age and what’s something else, you know? I haven’t coughed much, if that matters. And I don’t think I’ve had a fever. No, nothing else really. Just… tired and this pain. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: That is very helpful, Mr. Ruocco. Fatigue and chest pain. Now, let's talk about your medical history, if you don't mind. Do you have any existing medical conditions that you've been diagnosed with?
PATIENT: Medical history… Oh, boy. That's a tough one. I’ve been to doctors over the years, of course. But… what did they say? I had something with my heart a long time ago, I think. But it was fixed, or at least that's what they told me. And I’ve had problems with my blood pressure, but I don't take anything for it anymore. Honestly, Doctor, it's all a bit of a blur. I’m divorced now, you know. My wife, she always remembered all these things… I really can’t say for sure what all they told me.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Ruocco. It’s alright if you’re unsure. We can try to access your records, if you’ve seen other doctors recently. Do you recall where you typically receive your medical care, or perhaps the name of a previous physician?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I used to go to… over near the Hmong market. Dr. Vue, I think his name was. But that was years ago, before I moved here. Since then… I haven’t really seen a doctor regularly. Mostly just went to the emergency room when something was really bad. And I don't even remember which hospital that was. Things just… slip my mind these days. I’m sorry I’m not much help.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Mr. Ruocco. We will do our best. I’ll have the nurse check to see if we can obtain any records from Dr. Vue’s office. In the meantime, let’s talk about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family – heart disease, lung problems, or anything else?
PATIENT: Family history… My mother, she died young. Something with her heart, I think. But it was a long time ago. And my father, he lived a long life, but he smoked a lot. He had trouble breathing towards the end, but… I don't know if it was anything serious. My siblings… well, most of them are gone now. We weren’t very close, to be honest. So I don’t really know much about their medical history. Sorry, Doctor. I wish I could be more helpful.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Ruocco. We work with the information we have. Now, a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you smoked in the past?
PATIENT: No, never smoked. Never liked it. My father did, like I said, but I always stayed away from it. Didn’t see the point. I worked construction most of my life, lots of dust and hard work, but no smoking. Never touched a cigarette.
DOCTOR: Good. Now, do you drink alcohol?
PATIENT: A little. Sometimes, with dinner. Just a glass of wine, maybe. Nothing fancy. It helps me relax. I don’t drink every day, though. Maybe a few times a week. It’s not a habit, not really. I'm an old man. A little wine won't hurt.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Ruocco. Thank you for answering my questions. Now, I’d like to perform a brief physical examination, if you don't mind. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and check your blood pressure and oxygen levels. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgment. Just… try to be quick, if you can. I have some things I need to get done this afternoon. Let’s just get it over with.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Ruocco. I’ll be as efficient as possible. Please take a deep breath and exhale slowly for me. Your heart rhythm is regular, although I do detect a slight murmur. Your lungs sound a bit wheezy, which could indicate some narrowing of the airways. Your blood pressure is 140/90, which is slightly elevated. Your oxygen saturation is 92%, which is a little low. Do you experience any shortness of breath or difficulty breathing when you exert yourself?
PATIENT: Shortness of breath…? Hmm. Yes, sometimes. When I climb the stairs, definitely. Or if I have to walk a long distance. It’s not terrible, but… I have to stop and catch my breath. I thought it was just because I’m old, to be honest. I haven’t been doing much walking lately anyway. This winter was rough on my chest.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Ruocco. The shortness of breath with exertion and the wheezing I heard are concerning. Given your symptoms, medical history, and the findings on examination, I would like to order a chest X-ray to get a better look at your lungs. I also recommend a blood test to check your overall health and rule out any underlying infection. Would that be acceptable to you?
PATIENT: More tests… Well, if you think it's necessary, Doctor. I don’t really like going to hospitals and having things poked and prodded, but… I trust your judgment. Yes, alright. Do what you think is best. Just… how long will it take? And will it cost a lot of money? I'm not insured, you know.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Ruocco. We’ll try to make the process as quick and efficient as possible. The chest X-ray shouldn’t take more than a few minutes, and the blood test will only require a small sample. Regarding the cost, I’m aware you’re uninsured. Our billing department has programs to assist patients in need, and we can explore options to reduce your financial burden. We will work with you to ensure you receive the necessary care without significant hardship. I’ll have the nurse draw your blood and schedule the X-ray now. After we have the results, we can discuss them and formulate a treatment plan. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… better. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you explaining everything and working with me. I just… I don’t want to be a burden. Alright. Let’s get it over with. The sooner this is done, the sooner I can get home.
DOCTOR: You are not a burden, Mr. Ruocco. My priority is to ensure you receive the best possible care. Alright, I'll have the nurse come in now to draw your blood and schedule the X-ray. She will explain the process and answer any questions you may have. Please let me know if there's anything I can do to make you more comfortable. In the meantime, please rest. I’ll be back to discuss the results as soon as they are available.
