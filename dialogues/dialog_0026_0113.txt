DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Segretto. It's lovely to meet you. I'm Dr. Finco. So, to start us off, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hmm? Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Finco, you say? Well, it’s… it’s my waterworks, mostly. Been going a bit too often, if you catch my drift. Old age, probably. Everything gets a bit… leaky, doesn’t it? Though my wife, bless her heart, thinks I’m drinking too much tea. Which is nonsense, of course. I just like a good cuppa.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. Frequent urination can be quite bothersome. And tea can have an effect, certainly, but it’s good to rule out other possibilities as well. So, when you say “too often,” could you give me a rough idea of how many times you're going to the bathroom during the day, and also overnight?
PATIENT: Overnight? Now that's the problem. Used to sleep right through, solid as a rock. Now… well, I don't want to get into specifics, Doctor. It’s… enough to say it’s not ideal. During the day… hmm. Let me think. More than usual, I suppose. Used to be… three, maybe four times. Now it’s… five, six? Something like that. I don't keep a tally, you know. I’ve got a farm to run, not a bladder diary. Honestly, it's a nuisance, mostly. A bit embarrassing, too, when I'm visiting folks.
DOCTOR: I completely understand, Mr. Segretto. No need for a bladder diary, of course! It's helpful to have a general idea, though, and you’ve given me a good starting point. And it's perfectly normal to feel a bit embarrassed discussing these things. Now, besides the frequency, have you noticed any urgency – a sudden, strong need to go?
PATIENT: Urgency… Hmm. Sometimes. Not every time, mind you. But there are moments… you’re out tending the tomatoes, perfectly content, and then… bam. Gotta go, right now. It’s… unpleasant. Makes you rush, you know? Not dignified for a man my age. And it’s worse when I'm driving. I have to plan my routes around… well, you understand. Makes a simple trip to town a bit of an ordeal.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand completely. That sounds very disruptive, and it's good you're being mindful of it. Have you noticed any change in the stream itself?
PATIENT: The stream? Now what do you mean by that, Doctor? Is this about the… the force of it? Because, honestly, I don’t spend a lot of time analyzing my… waterworks. It goes, and that's that. It’s not like a garden hose, you know? It’s… normal, I suppose. Not weak, not strong, just… adequate. Though I think it takes a bit longer to get going sometimes. A bit of a… hesitation, if you catch my drift. But maybe that's just old age creeping in again. Everything slows down eventually, doesn't it?
DOCTOR: You're right, things do slow down eventually! And you don't need to analyze it too much. Just trying to gather a full picture. The hesitation you mention is helpful to know. Now, have you noticed any pain or burning when you urinate?
PATIENT: Pain? No, no pain. Not a bit. Burning… well, maybe a slight discomfort sometimes. But it’s nothing major. Just… a little sting, perhaps. It doesn't happen every time, and it goes away quickly. Honestly, Doctor, I’ve had worse aches from pulling weeds. I think it’s just… sensitivity, you know? Old age again. Everything’s a bit… tender these days. Though my wife keeps telling me to drink more water. Says it’ll flush things out. Women… always have a solution for everything.
DOCTOR: Wives often do! And hydration is a good idea in general. Now, let's talk about your medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you ever been diagnosed with diabetes, or had any problems with your kidneys?
PATIENT: Diabetes? No, never. Though my father, God rest his soul, had a bit of a sweet tooth. Kept a jar of honey under the stairs. But me? I prefer a good black tea, unsweetened. Kidneys… hmm. I don’t recall any trouble with my kidneys. Had a bit of a backache a few years back, but the chiropractor sorted that out. He cracked a few things, and I was right as rain. Honestly, Doctor, I don’t go to doctors much. Waste of time, mostly. I prefer to rely on common sense and a good night’s sleep.
DOCTOR: That's good to know. And I appreciate you being so open with me, Mr. Segretto. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Surgeries… well, let me think. When I was a young man, I had my tonsils out. Terrible pain, that was. And I broke my arm falling out of a tree when I was a boy. They set it in a cast, and that was that. Other than that… no, nothing major. I’ve been a fairly healthy man, all things considered. A bit of aches and pains, like anyone else my age, but nothing that required a hospital stay. Though my wife was in hospital a few years back with her gallbladder. A terrible ordeal, that was. She's a strong woman, though. Bounced right back.
DOCTOR: Good to hear she recovered well. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications? Not really. I take a bit of aspirin now and then for my joints, when they're acting up. And sometimes, if I can’t sleep, I take one of those over-the-counter sleeping pills. But that’s about it. I don’t like taking pills, if I can avoid it. Too many side effects, you know? My wife keeps trying to get me to take something for my blood pressure, but I tell her I’m perfectly fine. A bit of stress now and then, that’s all. And a good cup of tea always calms me down.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s helpful to know. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmm. Not that I'm aware of. I get a bit of a sniffle sometimes when the pollen is bad in the spring, but that's just seasonal. And I avoid shellfish, mostly. Always did find it a bit… fishy. My wife says I have a sensitive stomach. But other than that, no. I can eat pretty much anything. I've always been a hearty eater. A good farmer needs his strength, you know? Though I do steer clear of those fancy foreign foods. Too many strange ingredients. Give me a good potato and a bit of sausage any day.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Segretto. Thank you for answering my questions so thoroughly. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if you don't mind. It will just involve listening to your heart and lungs, and a brief abdominal exam. And I may need to check a urine sample. That will help us get a better understanding of what's going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Hmm. A urine sample, eh? Well, I suppose so. Always did dislike those little cups. Feels a bit… undignified. And poking and prodding? Not a fan, I must say. But if it helps, I suppose I can endure it. A doctor's gotta do what a doctor's gotta do, I suppose. Just… try to be gentle, alright? And don't take too long. I've got tomatoes to tend to, you know. Lead on, I suppose. Just get it over with quickly.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Segretto. I'll be as quick and gentle as possible. First, let’s get that urine sample. I'll give you a cup and a private bathroom. Just try to collect a mid-stream sample – that means start urinating, then collect a bit in the cup, and finish. It helps to get a cleaner sample. I’ll wait outside, and you can just let me know when you’re finished. Take your time.
PATIENT: A mid-stream sample… Honestly, the things they ask you to do these days. Old age… it’s not for the faint of heart. Alright, alright. It's done. Happy now? Let’s get this over with.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Segretto. I appreciate your patience. Now, if you'd just lie down on the examination table, I'll listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds regular, a slight murmur, which is common for someone your age. Lungs are clear, no wheezing or crackles. Your abdomen is soft, no tenderness. I’m not feeling any masses or enlargement. Alright, Mr. Segretto. Everything seems normal on the physical exam. Now, I'll send this urine sample to the lab for analysis. That will help us rule out any infection or other problems. It usually takes a day or two to get the results back.
PATIENT: Infection, you say? Oh dear. My wife will have a field day with that. "I told you so," she'll say. "You need to drink more water." A day or two, eh? Well, I suppose I can endure it. But if it's nothing serious, I expect a full apology. And a strong cup of tea. So, what do you think it could be, then? Just old age, or something more sinister? Don't sugarcoat it, Doctor. I'm a farmer, I can handle the truth.
DOCTOR: It's unlikely to be anything sinister, Mr. Segretto. The most common cause of frequent urination in men your age is an enlarged prostate, also known as Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia, or BPH. It's very common as men get older, and it doesn't necessarily mean anything is seriously wrong. It simply means the prostate gland is getting larger, which can put pressure on the bladder and cause you to feel the urge to urinate more often. The urine test will help rule out any infection, which can also cause similar symptoms. And depending on the results, we may need to do further tests, such as a PSA blood test, to get a better understanding of your prostate health. But for now, let's not jump to conclusions. We’ll wait for the results and go from there. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Prostate, eh? Something about getting bigger, pressing on things… Sounds unpleasant. And a PSA test? More poking and prodding, I presume? Honestly, Doctor, I'm starting to feel like a pin cushion. So, it’s not… serious? Not… you know… the other thing? My wife keeps reading those terrible articles online. All doom and gloom. And what do we do about it, then? Is there a pill for it? Or do I just have to spend the rest of my life running to the bathroom? A farmer's got things to do, you know. Can't be wasting time on… waterworks.
DOCTOR: No, Mr. Segretto, it doesn't sound like anything serious at this point. BPH is not cancer, and it's very treatable. It doesn't automatically mean you have or will develop cancer. It's a common age-related change. As for treatment, there are several options. Lifestyle modifications, such as reducing caffeine and alcohol intake, and bladder training exercises can sometimes help. There are also medications, called alpha-blockers and 5-alpha reductase inhibitors, that can help relax the muscles in the prostate and reduce its size. We would discuss those options if the results of the tests show that medication is appropriate. In some cases, more invasive procedures, such as surgery, may be necessary, but that's usually a last resort. We’ll discuss all the options if and when they become necessary. For now, let’s focus on getting the test results back and then we can make a plan together. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Alright… alright. So, it’s not the end of the world, then. Just a bit of… enlarging. And pills, possibly. I still don’t like the sound of pills. My wife will be pleased, though. Always has a solution for everything. Bladder training exercises? Now that sounds ridiculous. A farmer's got things to do, you know. Can't be stopping every five minutes to… train my bladder. So, what do I do in the meantime? Just… endure it? Keep running to the bathroom? And avoid caffeine and alcohol? My tea, you mean? That’s just cruel. And how long will these test results take? A day or two, you said? I’ve got tomatoes to tend to, you know. Can’t be waiting around all week.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Segretto, you're right, a day or two is the typical turnaround time for the lab results. I'll call you as soon as they're back. In the meantime, yes, try to endure it. And yes, reducing caffeine and alcohol can help. But I understand about the tea! It doesn't mean you have to completely give it up, just try to moderate your intake. And bladder training exercises are not for everyone. We can discuss them further if the results show it might be beneficial. Also, try to avoid drinking large amounts of fluids before bedtime to reduce nighttime urination. And make sure you empty your bladder completely each time you go. For now, let's just take things one step at a time. We'll get the test results, discuss the options, and make a plan that works for you. Don't worry too much about it right now. And I understand your concerns about the tomatoes! We’ll get this sorted out as quickly as possible. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all for now, Doctor. Just… get those results back quickly, alright? I’ve got tomatoes to tend to, and a wife who’s waiting to say "I told you so." Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you… explaining things. Even if it’s not what I wanted to hear. Let me know when those results are back, alright? And try not to keep me waiting.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Segretto. I will call you as soon as the results are back. And I'll do my best to keep you updated.
