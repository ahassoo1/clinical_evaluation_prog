DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Aluia. I’m Dr. Fazzina. It's… good to meet you. Now, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just Clarke is fine. Well, it's my legs, see? I got these… bumps. Red ones. On my shins, mostly. They're kinda painful, especially when I touch them. Been bothering me for a bit now.
DOCTOR: Okay, Clarke. Bumps on your shins, painful to the touch… I see. And how long have these bumps been bothering you, roughly?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Maybe… a month or so? It started with just one, I think, and then more kept showing up. Not every day, but little by little. It's hard to say exactly, you know? Time flies when you're… well, when you're my age.
DOCTOR: Yes, it certainly does. A month or so… alright. And have you noticed anything that seems to make them worse, or better?
PATIENT: That's a good question. I haven't really paid that much attention, to be honest. I work a lot, moving things around, you know? So maybe when I'm on my feet all day they feel a bit more sore? But I don’t know if that’s just because I'm tired. Nothing seems to make them better, though. Just… there.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, they're consistently there, feel a little worse after being on your feet… I understand. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the bumps?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… like what kind of symptoms? I mean, no fever, no chills. Just the bumps and the pain. They don’t itch, thankfully. And I haven't noticed any swelling anywhere else, if that's what you mean. I'm not sure what other symptoms I should be looking for, Doctor.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Clarke. We'll figure it out. No itching, no swelling, no fever… good. Now, let's talk a little about your past medical history. Do you have any medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Not really. I've been pretty healthy, knock on wood. Just the usual aches and pains that come with getting older, you know? High blood pressure, maybe, years ago, but I think it’s under control now. And arthritis in my knees, but that's pretty mild. I'm on Medicare, if that helps.
DOCTOR: Okay, high blood pressure in the past, mild arthritis… that’s helpful to know. Do you take any medications for those conditions, or anything else for that matter?
PATIENT: Just a little something for my knees when they really bother me. It’s… I think it’s called ibuprofen? The white pills. And sometimes a Tylenol for a headache, but not very often. That's about it, Doctor. Nothing regular, really. My wife handles most of the pills, to be honest. I just take what she gives me.
DOCTOR: Alright. Ibuprofen as needed for your knees, Tylenol occasionally. We’ll verify that list later. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope, not that I know of. Never had a bad reaction to anything, thankfully. My wife always asks when she gets me new things, but I haven't ever told her "yes." I eat pretty much everything, too. I like Filipino food, of course, but I try all sorts of things. I don't think I'm allergic to anything.
DOCTOR: Good. No known allergies. Now, just a few more questions about your general health. Do you smoke, or have you smoked in the past?
PATIENT: No, never smoked. My father smoked, and he didn’t live very long, so I always stayed away from it. My wife doesn’t like it either, of course. Bad for you, you know? And I like being able to breathe.
DOCTOR: Alright, good. And how about alcohol?
PATIENT: Just a little beer sometimes. With dinner, maybe. Or on special occasions. Not every day, though. My wife and I, we're not big drinkers. Maybe one or two beers a week, if that. It's more for the company than anything else.
DOCTOR: Okay, light alcohol use. Now, just one last general health question before we take a look at your legs. Are there any major medical issues that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a tough one. My mother had… diabetes, I think? And my father, like I said, he had lung problems. Lots of heart trouble on both sides of the family, too. My older brother had a heart attack a few years back. And arthritis, plenty of that. It seems like a lot of problems, when you think about it. But what can you do, right? It's just how it is.
DOCTOR: Yes, it can be… a lot. Okay, diabetes, lung problems, heart trouble, and arthritis in the family. Alright, Clarke, let's take a look at your legs now. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, please. That’s why I came, right? They’re right here. See? Red and bumpy. And kinda sore if you push on them.
DOCTOR: Alright. I see them. They're… slightly raised, red papules, primarily on your anterior shins. They do appear tender to the touch. No warmth or swelling beyond the localized tenderness. It looks like there are a few different stages of development, some newer, some older. Have you experienced any recent trauma to your legs – any cuts, scrapes, or bruises?
PATIENT: Trauma? No, not that I recall. I work around boxes and stuff, but I always try to be careful. I might bump them sometimes, but nothing major. Nothing that would cause bumps like these. I haven’t fallen or anything. My wife would have heard about it, believe me. She's got a good ear.
DOCTOR: Alright, no recent trauma… And are you currently experiencing any symptoms in other parts of your body?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Just my legs. No fever, no chills, no aches, no pains anywhere else. It’s just these bumps, and they're on my shins. I feel okay, otherwise. A little tired, maybe, but that's just from working. You know how it is.
DOCTOR: Alright. Based on what you've told me and my initial examination, these bumps could be shin splints, or possibly a form of dermatitis. However, to be certain, and to rule out other possibilities, I’d like to order a complete blood count and a skin scraping to check for infection. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Blood count and a… skin scraping? Oh boy. Sounds complicated. But… if that’s what you think is best, Doctor, then yes. Whatever you need to figure it out. I just want these things to go away. So, yes. Please. Let's do what we need to do.
DOCTOR: Alright, Clarke. We’ll get that ordered right away. The blood draw can be done in the lab just down the hall, and the skin scraping will be done here in the office. It shouldn't take too long. In the meantime, I'm going to recommend that you avoid activities that aggravate the pain, and keep the area clean and dry. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Avoid activities… that’s going to be tough. I work, you know? But I guess I can try to take it easy. Keep it clean and dry… okay, that makes sense. Hmm… well, how long will it take to get the results? And… what if it is something serious? I don’t want to worry my wife too much. She gets scared easily.
DOCTOR: That’s a very fair question, Clarke. The lab results usually come back within 24 to 48 hours. We’ll call you as soon as we have them. As for it being serious… it’s unlikely. Based on my exam, it’s most likely a skin irritation or a musculoskeletal issue. But we need the tests to confirm. If it were something more concerning, we’d discuss all of your options and develop a treatment plan. We won't know anything for sure until the results come back. Do you want me to write down the instructions for avoiding activities and keeping the area clean?
PATIENT: Yes, please. That would be very helpful. My memory isn’t what it used to be, you know? And it’s good to have it in writing for my wife, too. She likes to keep things organized. Thank you, Doctor. You’re very kind.
DOCTOR: Alright. Here you go. It says "Avoid strenuous activity, especially anything that causes pain in your shins. Rest and elevate your legs when possible. Keep the area clean with mild soap and water. Apply a dry, sterile bandage if needed." And if you notice any signs of infection – redness, swelling, pus, fever – please contact the office immediately. Do you have any other questions for me at this time, Clarke?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. You've been very helpful, Doctor. Thank you. I’ll try my best to follow those instructions. Hopefully, these tests will give us some answers. I guess I’ll go get that blood draw done then. Thank you again, Doctor Fazzina.
DOCTOR: Alright, Clarke. You're very welcome. The lab technician will take good care of you. And please don't hesitate to call if you have any concerns. We'll be in touch as soon as we have the results. Have a good day, and try not to worry too much. .
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. I will. Thank you again.
