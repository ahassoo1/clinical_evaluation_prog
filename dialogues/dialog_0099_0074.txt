DOCTOR: Right. Well, Ms. Steines, have a seat. Ninety years young, impressive. Now, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, thank you kindly. It's my blood pressure, Doctor. Been a little high lately, the nurse said. It's botherin' me some, makes me feel…fuzzier than usual. I just want to get it sorted if I can, don't want it gettin' worse.
DOCTOR: "Fuzzy," alright. And how high is "high," according to the nurse?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Numbers aren't my strong suit, never were. She wrote somethin' down... lemme see... Here it is. Um… 140 over… 90, I think? Something like that. It didn’t really stick with me, to be honest. I just know she said it weren't good.
DOCTOR: 140/90. Yes, that is elevated. Not catastrophic, but certainly requires attention. And you’ve noticed a feeling of…fuzziness?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. It’s hard to explain. Like… things ain’t as sharp as they used to be. And I get a little tired easier. Mostly just feel… off. It's been happenin' more these last few weeks, I reckon. Not every day, but often enough to worry me.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you been experiencing any other symptoms alongside this “fuzziness”?
PATIENT: Hmm... let me think. Not really. No headaches, no chest pain… sometimes my ankles swell up a bit at the end of the day, but that happens a lot, mostly when it’s hot. I've always had a little trouble with my feet. No dizziness or nothin' like that. Just the tiredness and the… well, you know. Not feelin' quite right.
DOCTOR: Swelling in the ankles… Okay. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Well, I had the usual things when I was younger – chickenpox, measles… nothing serious. Years ago, the doctor said I had a touch of arthritis in my hands, but it doesn’t bother me too much. And I had a gallbladder out when I was about sixty. Other than that… not much. I’ve been pretty lucky, all things considered. Oh, and my husband, bless his soul, he said I snored like a freight train! But I don’t think that counts.
DOCTOR: Snoring is… noted. Alright, any surgeries besides the gallbladder removal?
PATIENT: No, sir. Just the gallbladder. Never needed anything else taken out or fixed, thankfully. I always tried to stay active, you know? Walked every day when I could, gardened… kept myself movin'. I figure that’s why I’m still kickin’ at ninety.
DOCTOR: Good for you. And what about your family?
PATIENT: Oh, family. My husband, he passed ten years back. We didn't have any children, just the two of us. I have a sister, older than me, lives over in Oklahoma. She’s doin’ alright, as far as I know. We don't see each other much anymore, too far a drive for both of us. And a few nieces and nephews, but they're all busy with their own lives.
DOCTOR: Any history of heart disease, stroke, or high blood pressure in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm. That’s a good question. My daddy… he had a weak heart, I think. He didn’t live to be very old. And my aunt, on my mama’s side, she had a stroke when she was older. She didn’t recover well. As for blood pressure… I don’t rightly know. Nobody talked about such things much when I was growin' up. It weren’t somethin’ folks worried about back then.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you take any medications currently?
PATIENT: Just the one. For my arthritis. It's called… um… Here it is! Naproxen. I take one a day, sometimes two if my hands are botherin' me real bad. That’s it. I don’t take to pills much, if I can help it.
DOCTOR: Naproxen. Alright. And do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No sir, not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. I eat just about anything, and I've never had a problem. I used to help my husband with his beekeeping, and I was always around the honey and the beeswax, never got stung bad enough to bother me. I reckon I'm just a tough old bird.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, Ms. Steines, let’s do a quick physical exam. It’s standard procedure. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure again, and have a look at your extremities. Just to get a better picture of things. Can you roll up your sleeves?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That’s fine. Go right ahead. I don’t mind. Just gettin’ old, that’s all it is, I suppose. Been a good life, but these old parts are startin’ to wear out.
DOCTOR: Heart sounds… regular rate, slightly diminished. Lungs are clear, but some diminished breath sounds bilaterally. 150 over 92. Elevated, as expected. Pulses are present but weak. Now, let me take a look at your extremities… Moderate edema in bilateral lower extremities. Skin is warm and dry, but some mild arthritis is present in the hands, as you mentioned. Alright. Everything seems relatively normal, given your age and history. However, the elevated blood pressure and edema are concerning.
PATIENT: Well, that don’t sound too good, does it? What does it mean, Doctor? Is it somethin’ serious? I just want to know what I'm lookin' at, if you don't mind tellin' me straight. I've lived a long life, and I'd rather know what's goin' on.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Steines. Let’s be frank. Your blood pressure is consistently elevated, and the swelling in your ankles suggests fluid retention. This could be related to several factors, including age, arthritis, and possibly underlying heart or kidney issues. It's unlikely to be a sudden emergency, but uncontrolled high blood pressure can lead to serious complications over time – stroke, heart failure, kidney damage. Now, I want to order some blood work and an EKG to get a clearer picture of what’s going on. This will help me assess your kidney function, rule out any heart problems, and get a better baseline for your overall health. Does that sound agreeable?
PATIENT: Blood work and an EKG… That sounds… a lot. But if it'll tell you what's wrong, then yes. Yes, I reckon it's worth it. I just... I don't like needles much. But I suppose I can grit my teeth. Just tell me when and where, and I'll be there. I want to get this sorted, if I can. This fuzziness is worryin’ me, and I'd like to feel like myself again.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’ll have the nurse schedule you for blood work and an EKG at the lab across the hall. It'll be a standard panel – nothing too extensive. As for the "fuzziness," that could be related to the high blood pressure, but we need to rule out other causes. Once we have the results, we can discuss treatment options. In the meantime, I’m going to prescribe a low-dose diuretic – a water pill – to help reduce the fluid retention. And I want you to monitor your blood pressure at home, if possible. We'll need to see if the medication is effective. Do you have a blood pressure cuff at home?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I don’t. Never had a need for one before. My husband, he had one, but… well, that was a long time ago. I suppose I could get one, if you think it’s important. But I'm not very good with all this newfangled technology. I barely understand my cell phone as it is. Is it somethin’ I absolutely need?
DOCTOR: It’s highly recommended, Ms. Steines. Knowing your blood pressure at home is crucial for monitoring your condition and adjusting your medication appropriately. The nurse can show you how to use a simple automatic cuff – it’s not complicated. We can also arrange for you to come in weekly to have your blood pressure checked if you're unable to manage it at home. However, I strongly advise purchasing a cuff if possible. It will give you more control over your health. Now, let me write you a prescription for the diuretic, and we'll discuss potential side effects. It's important to be aware of what to expect. The diuretic is Hydrochlorothiazide, 12.5 milligrams daily. It helps your kidneys remove excess fluid and salt from your body, which will lower your blood pressure. Common side effects include increased urination, dizziness, and fatigue. If you experience any severe side effects – such as muscle cramps or weakness – contact me immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Increased urination, dizziness… well, that don’t sound too pleasant. But if it helps… I understand. I’ll be careful. And I'll have the nurse show me how to use that cuff thing. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you explainin’ it to me. It’s just… a lot to take in. I suppose I should read this over carefully before I leave. And I’ll try not to worry too much.
DOCTOR: Very well. The nurse will also provide you with a list of dietary recommendations to help lower your blood pressure. Reduce your sodium intake, eat plenty of fruits and vegetables, and maintain a healthy weight. It’s a lifestyle change, Ms. Steines. It won't be easy, but it's essential for your long-term health. Now, do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. You’ve explained everything very clearly, Doctor. I reckon I just need to process it all. Thank you for your time. And thank you for not makin’ me feel too foolish. It's hard gettin’ old, and all this new stuff… it can be a bit much. I’ll go find the nurse now, and we’ll get this sorted. Thank you again, Doctor. .
DOCTOR: Very well. The nurse will assist you. And try to remain optimistic, Ms. Steines. It's not a death sentence, just a few adjustments to your lifestyle. Good day. .
