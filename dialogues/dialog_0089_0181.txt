DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Mombrun. I'm Dr. Roseburrough. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you too. I requested a general wellness check, a lab panel, if you will. Just wanting to see how things are holding up, you understand. At my age, one likes to be… proactive.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Mombrun. Proactive is always good. A wellness check is a perfect idea. Let’s get some information down, and then we can decide on what labs would be most helpful. Just to start, have you been feeling generally well?
PATIENT: Yes, thankfully, I have been. No major complaints, Doctor. A few aches and pains, as one expects, but nothing that keeps me from my work. I’m still quite active, you see. Construction work keeps a man busy. I haven’t been sick sick, not even a bad cold, for quite some time now, thankfully.
DOCTOR: That's wonderful to hear! Staying active is fantastic. Construction work, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Been at it for… well, nearly fifty years now. Started with my father when I was a young man, fresh off the boat from Venezuela. Mostly residential now – building homes, additions, that sort of thing. It keeps me out in the sun, which I enjoy, and the work is… satisfying. Though the knees aren't what they used to be. But I manage.
DOCTOR: Good. It’s good you’re still able to do what you enjoy. Fifty years is quite a stretch! Alright, let’s talk a little bit about your medical history, just to get a baseline. Have you been diagnosed with any chronic conditions – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, heart problems, arthritis, anything like that?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, nothing formally diagnosed. My father always said a strong back and a good diet were all a man needed. My wife, bless her heart, she’s always been the one to worry about such things. She’ll remind me if I forget anything, I’m sure. But I've never had a doctor tell me I have any of those conditions. Blood pressure’s been checked at the pharmacy a few times, and they said it was usually a little high, but nothing alarming. I do have some stiffness in my joints, particularly in the mornings, but I put that down to the work, you see.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. And has that stiffness been getting progressively worse, or does it fluctuate?
PATIENT: It… fluctuates, I suppose. Some days it’s barely noticeable, other days it takes a little longer to get moving. It’s worse in the colder months, definitely. And after a particularly strenuous job, naturally. Nothing that a good cup of coffee and a bit of stretching can’t handle, though. It hasn’t stopped me from working, not yet. I’ve always been a bit stubborn, my wife says.
DOCTOR: Alright, stubbornness can be a good thing sometimes! Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Let me see… No major surgeries, no. I broke my arm when I was a boy, climbing a mango tree – foolishness, really. It healed up just fine, though. And I was in the hospital once, a long time ago, when my wife was giving birth to our daughter, but that hardly counts as being hospitalized, does it? Just waiting around, being supportive. No, nothing serious, thankfully. I’ve always been lucky, I suppose.
DOCTOR: That's good. Now, thinking about your family… are there any medical conditions that run in your family – heart disease, diabetes, cancer, anything like that?
PATIENT: Ah, that’s a good question. My father, he lived a long life, well into his eighties, but he did have some trouble with his heart towards the end. Nothing specific, just… weakening, you understand. My mother, she passed away relatively young, from… well, it was pneumonia, I believe. And my sister, she has some trouble with her blood sugar, but she wasn’t always the most disciplined with her diet. It’s hard to say, really. We weren’t always the best at keeping track of such things, back in Venezuela. It wasn’t always easy to see a doctor regularly, you see.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Mombrun. Alright, and are you currently taking any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, vitamins, supplements – anything at all?
PATIENT: Just a multivitamin, Doctor. My wife insists on it. Says I need to keep my strength up. And sometimes, if my knees are particularly sore, I’ll take ibuprofen, but not regularly. Just when I really need it. Nothing prescribed, nothing ongoing. I prefer to avoid medications if I can, you see. I believe in letting the body heal itself, as much as possible.
DOCTOR: Okay. And do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies that I'm aware of, Doctor. Never had any trouble with food, never had any reactions to medications. I've eaten all sorts of things in my life, traveled a bit, you see. Nothing's ever bothered me. My wife always asks, of course, before I try anything new, just to be safe. But no, no allergies that I know of.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that’s perfectly alright. Please, proceed. I’m happy to cooperate in any way I can. I haven’t been to a doctor in a while, so I’m sure you’ll find plenty to look at.
DOCTOR: Alright, good. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs first. Please take a deep breath in… and out… good. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear bilaterally. Now I’m going to check your blood pressure. Blood pressure is 142/88. A little elevated, but not alarming at this point. Now I'm going to feel your abdomen. Any tenderness here?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, nothing there. A little… firm, perhaps, but no tenderness. Oh, a little there, perhaps. That’s where I sometimes feel a bit of discomfort after a long day. But nothing serious, I assure you. Just… a bit of tightness. It’s probably just the work, you see. Lifting heavy things, bending, that sort of thing.
DOCTOR: Okay. I feel a bit of mild resistance in the lower abdomen, but no masses detected. Now, let's check your pulses. Pulses are strong and regular in all extremities. And finally, I'm just going to check your reflexes. Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally, which is normal. Alright, Mr. Mombrun, that concludes the physical exam. Everything seems generally okay, but your blood pressure is a little elevated, and I did note some mild tenderness in your lower abdomen. To get a better picture, I recommend some lab work. Would you be open to that?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds sensible. I trust your judgment. I'm happy to have the lab work done, whatever you think is necessary. I want to be sure everything is alright, you see. Just… what sort of lab work are you thinking of? And will it be a painful process?
DOCTOR: No, it won’t be painful, Mr. Mombrun. Just a simple blood draw and a urine sample. I’d like to check a complete blood count – that'll give us information about your red and white blood cells. We'll also check a comprehensive metabolic panel – that'll give us information about your kidney and liver function, blood sugar levels, and electrolytes. And finally, a lipid panel to check your cholesterol levels. With your slightly elevated blood pressure, it's important to get a baseline. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly reasonable. All of those things. Red and white blood cells, kidneys, liver, sugar… cholesterol. All of it. Please, proceed with whatever you deem necessary. I trust your expertise. And… is there anything I should do to prepare for these tests? Fasting? Drinking more water?
DOCTOR: Yes, good question. For the most accurate results, I’d like you to fast for 12 hours before the blood draw. That means no food or sugary drinks, just water. You can still take your usual medications, but please let the lab technician know what you’ve taken. And drinking plenty of water beforehand will make the blood draw easier. We’ll get you a slip for the lab, and they’ll take care of everything. Does that sound manageable?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that is perfectly manageable. Twelve hours fasting… water is fine. And I’ll be sure to tell the technician about the multivitamin. It’s good you mentioned that. I’ll make sure to follow your instructions carefully. When should I go to the lab? And… will they call me with the results, or will you?
DOCTOR: Alright. I’ll have the lab slip printed for you now. You can go to the lab anytime tomorrow. The address is [Lab Address - Placeholder]. They will call me directly with the results, typically within 48-72 hours. Once I have them, I'll give you a call to discuss them and formulate a plan. We can schedule a follow-up appointment then if necessary. Does that work for you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that is excellent. Tomorrow, to the lab. And you will call me with the results. That is most reassuring. I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything so clearly. I feel much better knowing what’s going on. Thank you. Is there anything else I should do or be aware of before tomorrow?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Mombrun. No, nothing else for now. Just try to relax, stay hydrated, and remember to fast for 12 hours before the blood draw. And don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before tomorrow. Here’s the lab slip. I’ll be in touch soon. Have a good day, and get some rest.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. I will. And I will certainly rest. You have a good day as well. And thank you again for your kindness and attention. .
