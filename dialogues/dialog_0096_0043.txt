DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Gibbel. I’m Dr. Burlingham. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, I got this headache, right here in the back of my head. It’s been botherin’ me for… oh, I’d say about three days now. Not constant, comes and goes, but when it does come, it’s a real pain. Feels like somethin’s tight, pullin’ on the back of my skull.
DOCTOR: Hmm, alright. Three days, you said. And it’s a pulling, tight sensation at the back of the skull. Is it on one side, or both?
PATIENT: Both sides, mostly. It's not sharp, you know? More like… a band squeezin’ my head. Sometimes it feels like it goes all the way around. It’s hard to explain, honestly. I haven’t had a headache like this in… well, a long time. Maybe since I was a young man workin’ in the fields. But those were different. Those were from the sun, I think.
DOCTOR: A band-like sensation around the head, not sharp. And you haven’t experienced anything quite like this since your younger days working in the fields. Okay. Has anything changed recently?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… changed? Hmm. Not really, not that I can recall. My routine's pretty much the same. Wake up, eat somethin’ light, maybe do some paperwork for my clients—I'm a financial advisor, you see—and then usually just relax in the afternoon. No new foods, no trips, nothin’ like that. My daughter visited last month, but that was good, not stressful. I did help her move some furniture, though… could that be it? I’m not a young man anymore, that’s for sure.
DOCTOR: Helping your daughter move furniture… alright. And how strenuous was that, exactly?
PATIENT: Oh, not terrible, but… it was a whole apartment’s worth. Lots of boxes, a big sofa, you know. I did most of the lifting with my son-in-law, thankfully. But I definitely felt it the next day. A little sore, but I didn't think much of it at the time. It wasn't until a couple days later the headache started. I figured it was just old age catchin’ up to me.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, headache onset a few days after helping your daughter move. We'll note that. Now, are you experiencing anything else along with the headache?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No fever, no dizziness. My vision’s been fine, I think. I can read my paperwork just as well as always. No nausea or throwin’ up. Just the headache, really. Sometimes my neck feels a little stiff, especially in the mornings, but I just figured that was from sleepin’ wrong. Oh! Now that I think about it, my ears have been ringin’ a little bit, too. Not all the time, just… sometimes. A quiet kinda ringin’. Does that mean somethin’?
DOCTOR: Ringing in the ears… alright. And how long have you noticed the ringing?
PATIENT: Oh, not long, Doctor. Maybe just the last couple of days, since the headache started. It's not loud, like a high-pitched whine, just… a subtle hum. Hard to describe. I hardly notice it unless I’m really quiet, you know? Like when I'm tryin’ to fall asleep. It’s probably nothin’, honestly. I get all sorts of little noises in my head when I’m old.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Gibbel. Let's just do a quick exam, just to be thorough. I’d like to check your blood pressure, pulse, and a quick neurological assessment. And I'll take a look at your ears. That’s just standard procedure. Then we can talk about what might be going on.
PATIENT: Sounds good, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. I’m happy to do whatever you need. Just let me know if it's gonna be somethin’… uncomfortable. I’ve got a low tolerance for pain these days.
DOCTOR: Alright. First, let’s take your blood pressure. Just relax your arm for me. 140 over 90… not terrible, but elevated. Pulse is regular, though a little fast. Ears look clear, no signs of infection. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes and cranial nerves. This will just involve me shining a light in your eyes and asking you to follow my finger. Can you follow my finger with your eyes without moving your head?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, I can. Like this? Is that alright? I sometimes get a little dizzy if I move my head too fast. It’s just somethin’ that happens with age, I suppose. I can see it just fine, though. Bright light’s not botherin’ me none.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s fine. Now, can you squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Like this? Is that good enough? Arthritis is gettin' to me, you see. Makes it hard to grip things sometimes. I used to be able to crush walnuts with these hands. Not anymore, though.
DOCTOR: Grip strength is diminished, bilateral. Alright, Mr. Gibbel. Based on what you’ve told me and the quick exam, it sounds like you’re likely experiencing a tension headache, possibly exacerbated by the recent physical exertion of helping your daughter move. It’s very common, especially with your age and activity level. We’ll rule out anything more serious, of course, but I suspect this is just muscle tension.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. Tension headache, you say? That sounds… reasonable. I’m glad it’s probably not somethin’ serious. I was worryin’ a little bit, to be honest. So, what do we do about it? Is there somethin’ I can take? I try to avoid pills if I can, but I'm willin' to do what I need to.
DOCTOR: Well, we can try a couple of things. First, I recommend over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or naproxen, if you're able to tolerate them. Follow the dosage instructions on the bottle. I’d also suggest applying a warm compress to your neck and shoulders. And try to get some rest, and avoid any strenuous activity for a few days. If it doesn’t improve after a week, or if it gets significantly worse, we can consider a muscle relaxant. But I prefer to start with the least invasive options first. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: That sounds… sensible, Doctor. Warm compress, rest, and some pills if I need ‘em. I can do that. I got plenty of warm towels and a comfy chair. And I can ask my daughter to pick up some ibuprofen next time she visits. She’s always lookin’ out for me. I appreciate you explainin’ it all to me. It put my mind at ease a bit, knowin’ it’s probably just tension. Is there anything else I should be watchin’ out for? Any symptoms that would mean I need to come back sooner?
DOCTOR: Yes. If you develop a fever, stiff neck, severe headache that doesn’t respond to medication, or any changes in your vision or speech, come back immediately. Those could indicate something more serious. But honestly, Mr. Gibbel, I suspect you’re just experiencing a typical tension headache. Try to relax, get some rest, and follow the instructions I gave you. Do you have any other questions for me before you leave?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don't think so. You've answered everything I was worryin' about. Thank you for takin' the time to see me, and for explainin’ it all so clearly. I really appreciate it. I’ll be sure to follow your instructions, and I’ll come back if things don’t improve, or if I start feelin’ worse. You have a good day now, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Alright. Get some rest. .
