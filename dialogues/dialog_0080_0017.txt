DOCTOR: Hi Danny, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Rosanova. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Uh, good day to you too, Doctor. Rosanova, you say? Yes. Well, I’m here… for the, uh… the physical. The one I need. For… the team. Yes. A tryout. It’s a… a sports thing. I think. It’s been a while since I signed up.
DOCTOR: Okay, a physical for a team tryout. Got it. That’s perfectly reasonable. And just to be clear, is this a new team you’re trying out for, or have you been with them for a while and this is just a routine check-up to stay current?
PATIENT: Routine? No, no. Not routine. Definitely not. I… I don’t recall a team before. This is… new. Yes. Very new. A friend told me about it. Said they needed players. I… I used to be pretty good, you know. A long time ago. But I don't remember which team. It was… around here, somewhere. Probably.
DOCTOR: Alright, so a new team, trying out, and you're wanting to make sure you’re physically able to participate. That’s smart. It's good you're thinking ahead. Let's go through some questions, just to get a good baseline. Do you have any current medical problems – anything that’s been bothering you lately, even if it seems small?
PATIENT: Medical… problems? Hmm. Let me think. My knees… they sometimes make a noise. Like… clicking. And my back… it gets a little stiff after I… well, after I sit for too long. Does that count as a problem? I mean, I’m not always stiff. Just… sometimes. Old age, I suppose. It happens. I don't go to the doctor much. Never really needed to. Before.
DOCTOR: Okay, clicking knees and occasional back stiffness – we can definitely look into those. It’s good to get them checked out before starting a new physical activity, just to be sure. Have you had any injuries to your knees or back in the past?
PATIENT: Injuries… Now that’s a tough one. I’ve… bumped into things. Fallen down a few times. Working construction, you know? Lots of… hard surfaces. But a serious injury? I don't… I can't say for sure. Maybe a sprain, once? A long, long time ago. It didn’t seem bad enough to see a doctor. I just… wrapped it. With a bandage. Things always healed, eventually.
DOCTOR: Alright, so some minor bumps and possible sprains in the past, but nothing requiring formal medical attention. Good to know. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications? No. Not really. Just… sometimes I take something for the… the heartburn. When I eat spicy food. But that's it. And I don’t take it every day. Maybe once a week. Or less. Just when I have the… the tacos. They’re very good tacos, you know. But they give me… trouble. A little. I don’t think that’s important, though. It's just… tacos.
DOCTOR: Okay, occasional heartburn medication for tacos - we'll make a note of that. It can be helpful to know, even if it seems minor. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… Hmmm. I… I don’t think so. I've eaten everything. Pretty much. Never had a problem. I get… itchy sometimes, if I’m around… flowers. But that's just… flowers. Everyone gets itchy around flowers, right? Not a real allergy. Just… a little sniffle. And maybe a little rash. But I don’t go looking for flowers. So it's not a problem.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no known serious allergies, just some mild reaction to flowers. That’s good to know. Now, let's talk a little bit about your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any serious medical conditions like heart disease, diabetes, high blood pressure, or anything else?
PATIENT: Serious… conditions? No. Not that I know of. Doctors never said anything. I… I went to the doctor when I was a kid. For the… shots. And maybe the chickenpox. But that was a long time ago. And I haven't been sick… really sick… in a long time. I feel pretty good, actually. For my age. I just… forget things sometimes. Like… what I was going to say. Does that count? Is that a condition?
DOCTOR: Okay, no major medical diagnoses that you’re aware of, and occasional forgetfulness. We'll make a note of that. It’s common to have some memory changes as we age. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Surgeries… Hmmm. Let me see. I think… maybe? When I was very young. Something with my… tonsils? But I don't remember. It was a long time ago. And I wasn't very awake. Hospital… Maybe once? For the… flu? Or something. It was just… overnight. They gave me some medicine. And then I went home. It wasn’t a big deal. Nothing serious. I don't think. My memory isn't what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Okay, possible tonsillectomy as a child and a brief hospitalization for an illness, but you don’t have clear recollection of either. That’s alright. Let's talk about your family history. Do you know if any of your close relatives – parents, siblings, grandparents – have any serious medical conditions like heart disease, diabetes, cancer, or anything else?
PATIENT: Family… history? Now that's a tough one. My… my mother, she… she was always sick. Something with her… stomach? But I don’t know what. She didn’t go to the doctor much either. My father… he was strong. Worked very hard. Never got sick. As far as I know. And my siblings… I haven’t seen them in… a long time. Very long. So I don't know what’s going on with them. They probably… they’re fine. Everyone’s fine. I think. It's hard to keep track.
DOCTOR: Okay, so your mother had some stomach problems, but you don’t have specifics, and your father was healthy. Limited information about your siblings. That's alright. Let's move on to your social history. Do you currently smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Smoke? No. Never. Bad for you. My father always said so. Alcohol… sometimes. A beer. With the tacos. On a… special occasion. Not every day. Maybe once a month. Or less. And drugs? No. Never. Never been interested. Bad people. I stay away from bad people. I’m a simple man. I like my tacos. And… and watching the games. That’s enough for me.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you don’t smoke or use drugs, and you occasionally drink a beer with your tacos. That’s good to know. Now, one final question before we move to the physical exam. Can you tell me about your typical daily activity level?
PATIENT: Activity level… Hmmm. Well, I… I walk. To the store. Sometimes. I do some… fixing around the house. Small things. Like… tightening screws. And… I watch a lot of television. The games, mostly. And… and I think about things. A lot. Does that count as activity? Thinking is… hard work. It uses a lot of energy. I don't run around much anymore. Not like… when I was younger. But I’m not… completely inactive. I think. I just… mostly sit. And think. And watch the games. It's a good life. A simple life.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you’re mostly sedentary but do some walking and light housework, and spend a good amount of time watching television. Alright, that gives me a good overall picture. Okay Danny, that’s very helpful. Now, let's do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, look in your ears and throat, and do a basic neurological exam. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… alright. Whatever you need to do. I trust your judgment. Just… don’t poke me too much. My bones aren't what they used to be. And… if it gets cold, let me know. I get… chilly easily. But yes. Go ahead. I'm ready. I think.
DOCTOR: Of course, I’ll be gentle. And I’ll let you know if anything feels uncomfortable. First, let’s start with your blood pressure. Okay, blood pressure is a little higher than we'd like, we'll keep an eye on that. Now, let's listen to your heart. Okay, heart sounds are good, but I do hear a slight murmur, which we'll note. Next, let’s listen to your lungs. Lungs are clear, no wheezing or crackles. Good. Ears look clear, no signs of infection. Throat is a little red, but no obvious signs of infection. Now, I’m just going to check your reflexes. Reflexes are a little diminished, but within normal limits for your age. And finally, I'll just feel your abdomen. Abdomen is soft, no tenderness. A little bit of… increased girth, but nothing alarming. Overall, everything seems… relatively stable. BMI is 23.5. A little overweight, but not severely so. I’m going to document these findings now.
PATIENT: Documenting… good. That sounds… professional. Is everything… alright, Doctor? You seem… concerned. The murmur… is that bad? And the redness in my throat… from what? I didn’t have a sore throat. I just… eat a lot of spicy tacos. Maybe that’s it? I'm a little worried now. Should I… stop eating the tacos? They're very good tacos, you know. But if they're causing problems… I can stop. Probably.
DOCTOR: Okay Danny, let’s not jump to conclusions. The murmur is… common, especially with age. It doesn't necessarily mean anything is wrong, but we’ll want to monitor it. And the redness in your throat is likely just irritation from the spicy food, as you suspected. It doesn’t seem like a serious infection. However, since your blood pressure is a little elevated, and given the murmur, I do want to run a few tests just to get a clearer picture. I’m going to order a basic blood panel to check your cholesterol, blood sugar, and kidney function. I’ll also order an EKG to evaluate your heart rhythm. And I recommend a chest X-ray just to rule out any underlying lung issues. These tests will give us more information to work with. As for the tacos, you don’t necessarily need to stop eating them completely, but I recommend cutting back a little and seeing if that helps reduce the throat irritation. And, maybe try a milder salsa for a while. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Tests… more tests. It’s always something. But… alright. If you think it’s necessary, Doctor. Blood… and the heart thing… and the chest thing. It’s a lot. Cutting back on the tacos… that’s… difficult. But I can try. Maybe just… smaller tacos. Or less often. The milder salsa… that’s a compromise I can live with. It wouldn’t be the same, but… I can try. When will I get the results? And will it… will it hurt? The tests, I mean. I don’t like needles very much. And the chest thing… does it involve radiation? I’ve heard bad things about radiation. I just… I want to be sure it’s safe.
DOCTOR: Okay Danny, I understand your concerns. The blood test will involve a small needle prick – it's usually quick and doesn’t hurt much. We'll take as little blood as possible. The EKG is completely painless – it involves placing small stickers on your chest, arms, and legs to measure your heart’s electrical activity. And the chest X-ray involves very low levels of radiation – it’s a standard procedure and the benefits of ruling out any underlying lung issues far outweigh the minimal risk. We take precautions to minimize your exposure. The lab results usually take about 2-3 business days to come back. Once I have them, I’ll review them carefully and schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results and create a plan. In the meantime, if you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath, or dizziness, please seek immediate medical attention. Do you have any other questions or concerns?
PATIENT: 2-3 business days… alright. Chest pain… I haven’t had any chest pain. Just… heartburn. From the tacos. I think. So no radiation, you say. That’s good. I read something about… mutations. And cancer. But you say it’s safe. I trust you, Doctor. I just… I worry. I’m an old man. Things break easily. No, I… I don't think that's all. Just… the heartburn. And the tests. And the tacos. Alright. Thank you, Doctor. For explaining everything. I appreciate it. Can I… can I still eat one taco while I wait for the results? Just one? A small one? With the milder salsa? It might… calm my nerves.
DOCTOR: Okay Danny, one small taco with milder salsa is perfectly fine. It's okay to enjoy things in moderation. And don’t worry too much. We’re just being thorough, and it’s better to be safe than sorry. I'll print out the lab orders and a sheet explaining the procedures. Our scheduling desk can help you set up the appointments. They're right down the hall. If you have any questions at all before your appointments, don’t hesitate to call the office. And remember, if you experience any concerning symptoms, please seek immediate medical attention. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think that's all. Thank you again. For everything. You’ve been very… patient. With an old man who worries about tacos. And mutations. I’ll go make the appointments. And… maybe I’ll order a small taco. With the milder salsa. Just… to calm my nerves. Thank you, Doctor. Goodbye.
