DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Redeye. I’m Dr. Yackey. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s these hiccups. They just won’t stop. Started a couple of days ago, and they’re still going. It's been over 48 hours now, I think. It’s really quite annoying, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Hiccups, you say. Over 48 hours. Right. And is there… anything else accompanying these hiccups?
PATIENT: No, not really. Just… the hiccups. No pain, no stomach trouble, nothing like that. I’ve tried drinking water really fast, holding my breath… all the usual things people tell you, but nothing’s worked. It just keeps going, and going, and going. It’s making it hard to concentrate, you know? I manage events, so…it's not ideal.
DOCTOR: Manage events. Interesting. And you’ve tried… all the common remedies. Very well. Let’s get a basic examination done, shall we?
PATIENT: Okay, sounds good. Whatever you think is best. I just want them to stop. Is there anything I should be worried about? I mean, I’ve never had hiccups last this long before.
DOCTOR: Generally, persistent hiccups are… rarely serious. However, prolonged hiccups can indicate an underlying issue. It's best to rule things out. Let me listen to your heart and lungs, and palpate your abdomen. Please lie back on the examination table.
PATIENT: Okay. Palpate… you mean, press on my tummy? I hope you don’t mind, I haven’t been eating much because of all the hiccups. I just don’t have much of an appetite when I’m constantly jolting.
DOCTOR: Yes, press on your abdomen. And a lack of appetite is… noted. It's helpful information, certainly. Deep breaths, please. In… and out. Good. Now, one more breath…and hold it.
PATIENT: Like this? It’s a little hard to breathe deeply with the hiccups, you know. They just… interrupt. Is that okay? Should I try breathing normally?
DOCTOR: Breathing is… adequate. Now, if you’ll just lie flat, I’ll palpate your abdomen. Try to relax, if you can. Any tenderness here?
PATIENT: Ooh, that’s a bit… firm. Not exactly painful, but definitely noticeable. Around here… Feels a little… sensitive. Like something's a bit off, but not bad. I just don't usually feel it that much.
DOCTOR: Sensitivity in the upper abdomen. Alright. And have you noticed any nausea, vomiting, or changes in your bowel movements?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. No nausea, no throwing up, and… everything's pretty normal downstairs, if you don’t mind me saying so. It’s just the hiccups, and now this… sensitivity. Honestly, I'm starting to worry it's something serious. I have an event next week, a big one, and I really need to be on top of things. Do you think it could be stress? I have been a bit run down lately.
DOCTOR: Stress is… a factor in many ailments, certainly. However, we must rule out other possibilities. Given the persistent hiccups and the abdominal sensitivity, I'd like to order a complete blood count and a basic metabolic panel. And perhaps an abdominal ultrasound, just to be thorough. It’s just to rule out… more concerning etiologies. I’ll have the nurse draw the blood now. Do you have any allergies to contrast dye?
PATIENT: Contrast dye? Oh, goodness. I… I don’t think so. I’ve had injections before, and nothing happened. But I’m not really sure about dye. Would the ultrasound need that? And what exactly are you looking for? Is it something…bad? I don't mean to pry, but I'm always a bit anxious when it comes to tests. It’s probably just my age, but… things always seem more serious when you get older, you know?
DOCTOR: It’s standard procedure. The ultrasound may require contrast dye, depending on the images. It’s to rule out gallbladder issues, liver problems...nothing to cause undue alarm. We'll see what the initial images show. Now, let's not borrow trouble before we need to. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood. It’s a simple procedure. Do you have any current medications or supplements you are taking?
PATIENT: No, nothing regular. I used to take something for my blood pressure, years ago, but the doctor took me off it. Just… vitamins, occasionally. Nothing consistent. I try to eat healthy, that’s all. And I really do try to keep my stress down, but…event planning isn't exactly a relaxing job, you know? So, just blood work and maybe an ultrasound? Is that it for now? And… how long will it take to get the results? I really need to know if I’m going to be able to manage next week’s event.
DOCTOR: Blood work and potentially an ultrasound. Results typically take 24 to 48 hours, depending on the lab. The nurse will schedule the ultrasound, if it is deemed necessary after the blood work. In the meantime, continue to hydrate and try…deep breathing exercises. I'm dismissing you now, I'll review the results once they're available and contact you. Any further questions before you go?
PATIENT: Well… No, I think that’s all. Just… please let me know as soon as you have the results, okay? I’m really worried about this event, and I don’t want to let anyone down. And… thank you, Doctor. Hopefully, it’s just something simple. .
DOCTOR: Certainly. The nurse will assist you. Have a good day. .
