DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Mr. AlCorta. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Renzi. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, it’s… my sight, frankly. It’s been going. Not suddenly, mind you. It’s just… diminished. I suppose you’d say it’s getting worse. It's rather inconvenient, and I expect a proper explanation, if you don't mind my saying.
DOCTOR: Diminished vision… okay. And you said it's been gradual?
PATIENT: Yes, gradual. Over… oh, I'd say the last six months or so. Not overnight, thankfully. Though, one would think, being in the 21st century, something more could be done about it. My ex-wife always said I spent too much time reading. Perhaps she was right, in a terribly roundabout way. It's just… things aren’t as sharp as they used to be. Do you follow?
DOCTOR: I do follow, Mr. AlCorta. Gradual onset is good information. And it’s possible reading contributed, but many things can cause vision changes. To get a better idea of what’s going on, could you describe how your vision is changing?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Well… everything seems… hazy. Not blurred, exactly, but lacking definition. Like looking through a slightly dirty window, perhaps? And… and this is going to sound ridiculous, but sometimes it's difficult to see things in my periphery. As if there's a… a shadowing around the edges of my vision. It doesn’t completely disappear, mind you, just… less noticeable. It's rather distressing, truthfully. I used to be able to spot a hawk circling a mile away. Now… well, it's just not the same.
DOCTOR: Hazy vision with peripheral shadowing… okay. And is this happening in both eyes, or just one?
PATIENT: Hmm. That's a fair question. I… believe it's both. Though, perhaps it’s more pronounced in my left eye. It's difficult to say with certainty, truthfully. I haven’t been… actively comparing them, Doctor. One doesn’t usually spend one’s day assessing the relative clarity of one’s eyesight, you understand. It simply… is. Then it isn’t. Do you require a more… precise assessment? I suppose I could close one eye at a time, if you insist. Though I doubt it will yield a drastically different result.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. AlCorta. Closing one eye at a time would be helpful, yes. Let's start with your right eye. Could you cover your left eye with your hand, and tell me what you see?
PATIENT: Very well. Though I must say, this feels… rather rudimentary. One would expect a more sophisticated examination, given the state of modern medicine. It appears… blurry, as I mentioned. The lines of the artwork on the wall are indistinct. And that… lamp over there? It lacks its usual sharpness. Honestly, it's not a particularly enlightening exercise. Is this… necessary?
DOCTOR: It is, Mr. AlCorta. Helps me get a baseline. Okay, now cover your right eye and tell me about your vision with your left eye.
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, it's remarkably similar. Perhaps slightly… dimmer. The haziness is certainly present, and the peripheral shadowing is… noticeable. It's as if someone has turned down the contrast. It’s hardly a revelatory experience. Is there a machine, perchance? Some sort of device that can accurately measure the… deficiency? I find all this subjective observation rather… unsatisfactory.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. AlCorta. Subjective assessment is a starting point, but you are right, a more objective test is needed. We do have equipment for that. Before we proceed, I'd like to ask a few more questions. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the vision changes?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me see… other symptoms. No… not particularly. No pain, no flashes of light, no… floaters, whatever those are. My head aches occasionally, but that’s likely due to the general… state of the world. No double vision. My balance is… adequate. No difficulty with color perception, as far as I can tell. Honestly, Doctor, it's mostly just the sight. A gradual, inconvenient decline. I suppose I should mention… I’ve been feeling rather fatigued lately. But that could be anything, couldn’t it? A lack of purpose, perhaps? A poor diet? It’s difficult to isolate these things.
DOCTOR: Fatigue is good to know, even if the cause is uncertain. Let’s talk a bit about your medical history. Do you have any known medical conditions?
PATIENT: Medical history? Well, let me see… I had the chickenpox as a child, naturally. And a rather nasty bout of influenza a few years back. Beyond that… not particularly. I’ve always prided myself on being… robust. I don’t subscribe to the modern obsession with constant medical intervention. A bit of rest, a healthy diet – those were my preventative measures. I suppose I had my tonsils removed when I was quite young, but that hardly qualifies as a significant medical condition, does it? No diabetes, no heart trouble, no… any of the usual ailments. I’ve always considered myself… remarkably healthy, all things considered. It’s rather disconcerting to be experiencing this vision loss, frankly. It suggests… a more serious underlying issue, doesn’t it?
DOCTOR: It’s good to know you’ve generally been healthy. No diabetes or heart trouble is certainly good news. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… Hmm. Let me think. No, not exactly. Except… well, there was that minor procedure on my knee, years ago. A torn meniscus, playing racquetball. But it was hardly a surgery, really. More of a… a scoping, if you will. They didn't even have to open me up. A bit of discomfort, a few weeks of physical therapy, and I was back on the court. Beyond that… no. I’ve always been fortunate enough to avoid the scalpel. I believe in maintaining a healthy lifestyle, as I mentioned. It tends to minimize the need for such… drastic measures. It's rather bothersome, honestly, this line of questioning. Are we getting any closer to a diagnosis, Doctor? Or are we merely cataloging my lack of ailments?
DOCTOR: A minor scoping is good to know. We are gathering information, Mr. AlCorta. Now, what about your family?
PATIENT: My family? Well, that's a… complicated subject. My father was a stoic, a man of few words. He passed away some years ago, complications of… old age, I believe. My mother… she was a bit of a worrier. Prone to headaches and digestive issues, as I recall. My ex-wife's family was… rather unremarkable. A few instances of high blood pressure, I think. Nothing terribly significant. As for genetic predispositions… I honestly haven't a clue. We weren't particularly close, you understand. Family gatherings were… infrequent, and generally unpleasant. I doubt anyone kept meticulous medical records. Frankly, Doctor, I doubt there’s much to be gleaned from my familial history. It’s hardly a treasure trove of pertinent information. Are we quite finished with this… genealogical exploration? It's rather invasive, if you don't mind my saying.
DOCTOR: I understand. And finally, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… Hmm. No, not that I'm aware of. I've always been remarkably resilient. I can tolerate most foods, even the more… exotic varieties. I’ve never had a reaction to any medication, as far as I recall. Perhaps a slight sensitivity to bee stings as a child, but that hardly qualifies as an allergy, does it? A bit of swelling, a mild discomfort, and it subsided within a few hours. Beyond that… no. I've always prided myself on my robust constitution. It's rather disconcerting, honestly, to be experiencing this vision loss without any accompanying symptoms. No allergies, no genetic predispositions, no underlying medical conditions… It suggests something truly… perplexing, doesn't it? Are we finally ready to proceed with some actual… diagnostic testing? Or are we going to continue cataloging my lack of ailments? I have a rather important appointment this afternoon, you understand.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. AlCorta, we are ready for testing. I apologize for all the questions; it's simply my duty to gather as much information as possible. Now, let’s move on to a brief physical exam. I’d like to check your vision more formally, your blood pressure, and I'll take a look in your eyes with an ophthalmoscope. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Very well. Though I must reiterate, I find all this… rudimentary testing rather… underwhelming. I expect a more thorough investigation, given the gravity of the situation. And please, be gentle. I have a rather high tolerance for discomfort, but I do appreciate a degree of… finesse. Proceed, then. But I trust you’ll be swift. And thorough. I wouldn’t want this to take up too much of my afternoon. Let's get this over with, shall we?
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. AlCorta, could you read the smallest line you can see on this chart?
PATIENT: Umm… let me see. E… H… P… Z… F… No, wait. Is that a G? I'm terribly sorry, Doctor. It's all rather… blurred. I can make out the larger letters, of course. But the smaller ones… they're quite indistinct. It's rather frustrating, honestly. I used to have impeccable eyesight. I could spot a hawk circling a mile away. Now… well, it's rather diminished. Are you certain this chart is calibrated correctly? It seems… unreasonably difficult to read. Perhaps the lighting is inadequate? Or my glasses are smudged? It's all very… imprecise. Can you perhaps adjust the chart? Or perhaps use a different one? It's all rather… unsettling.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. AlCorta, it does seem like your vision is reduced. Now I’m going to check your peripheral vision. Focus straight ahead, and tell me when you can see the wiggling finger coming from the side. I’m noticing your peripheral vision seems a little limited. Finally, I’ll use the ophthalmoscope to examine the back of your eyes. It’s a quick, painless procedure. Okay, all done. The back of your eyes appear… relatively normal, but I did notice some mild changes to your optic nerve and some small deposits. It's not alarming, but warrants further investigation.
PATIENT: "Mild changes"? "Small deposits"? Doctor, are you telling me something is… wrong with my eyes? I specifically requested a thorough examination, and all I receive are vague pronouncements about "mild changes" and "small deposits"! This is utterly unsatisfactory! I pride myself on my health, you understand. I eat a balanced diet, I exercise regularly, and I avoid unnecessary stress. To discover I have "changes" and "deposits"… it's simply… unacceptable! What does this mean, Doctor? Are we talking about cataracts? Glaucoma? Macular degeneration? Please, be specific! I need to know what's happening to my eyes! I refuse to sit idly by while my vision deteriorates without a proper explanation! And what does "further investigation" entail? More vague pronouncements? More rudimentary testing? Or are we finally going to get to the root of this problem? I expect a clear diagnosis, a detailed treatment plan, and a realistic prognosis. And I expect it now! Frankly, Doctor, I'm beginning to lose faith in your competence. This is hardly the level of care I expected.
DOCTOR: Mr. AlCorta, please, let’s not jump to conclusions. You are right to be concerned, and I apologize for not being clearer. The changes I saw aren’t necessarily indicative of a serious condition, but they do warrant further investigation. I don’t believe this is cataracts, glaucoma, or macular degeneration based on the initial examination, but we need more testing to confirm. The “changes” refer to a slightly pale optic disc, which can be caused by a number of factors, including age, high blood pressure, or reduced blood flow. The “deposits”, known as drusen, are common age-related changes and are often harmless. However, in some cases, they can be an early sign of macular degeneration. To get a definitive diagnosis, I recommend a visual field test, which will map your peripheral vision more accurately, and an optical coherence tomography scan, which will provide detailed images of the layers of your retina. I also recommend you get your blood pressure checked to rule out any underlying hypertension. Would you like me to schedule these tests for you?
PATIENT: "Visual field test," "OCT scan," "hypertension…" More medical jargon! Doctor, are you deliberately attempting to confuse me? I specifically requested a clear and concise explanation, and all I receive are a barrage of technical terms! Very well. If these "tests" are absolutely necessary, then schedule them. But I insist on a detailed explanation of the results, in plain English, before any further action is taken. And I expect a realistic timeline. I have a busy schedule, you understand. I cannot afford to spend weeks undergoing endless testing. And please, ensure the technicians are competent. I will not tolerate being subjected to amateurish examinations. Finally, I expect you to review my medical history thoroughly. I refuse to believe this vision loss is merely "age-related." There must be an underlying cause, and I expect you to find it. Schedule the tests, Doctor. And please, do so promptly. I have an appointment to keep. This entire ordeal is incredibly inconvenient. And frankly, quite distressing. I trust you understand the gravity of the situation. My eyesight is not something to be taken lightly.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. AlCorta, I understand. I’ll schedule you for a visual field test and an OCT scan as soon as possible. The earliest appointments are next Tuesday at 9 AM for the visual field test and Wednesday at 2 PM for the OCT scan. Does that work for you?
PATIENT: Tuesday at 9 AM… and Wednesday at 2 PM. Fine. Though it disrupts my schedule considerably, it will have to suffice. Ensure the technicians are prepared. I will not tolerate any delays or incompetence. And please, remind me to bring my glasses and any other relevant documentation. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have a rather important appointment to attend to. I trust you’ll have the results of these "tests" ready for review promptly. I expect a detailed explanation, in plain English, before any further action is taken. And please, do not contact me with unnecessary updates. I will contact you when I am ready to discuss the results. Good day, Doctor. I sincerely hope these tests yield some positive results. My eyesight is not something to be taken lightly. And frankly, I’m beginning to lose patience.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. AlCorta. We’ll be prepared. I’ll see you on Tuesday. Have a good day, and please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions before then.
