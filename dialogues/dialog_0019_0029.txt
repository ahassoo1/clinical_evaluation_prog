DOCTOR: Well, good afternoon, Mr. Obarr. It’s lovely to meet you. I'm Dr. Renzi. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon to you too, Doctor. Nice to meet you as well. Well, it’s a bit… peculiar, really. I just don’t seem to be able to eat much these days. I get full so quickly. It’s not a comfortable feeling, not painful, just… done. Even a little bit of food feels like a whole meal.
DOCTOR: Okay, that is peculiar. And how long has this been going on, Mr. Obarr?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It’s been creeping up on me, I suppose. Maybe… three, four months now? At first, I just thought I wasn't as hungry as usual, you know? Old age, probably. But it’s gotten worse. Now it’s like… after just a few bites, I have to stop. It’s frustrating, because I want to eat, I just… can’t.
DOCTOR: Alright, three or four months. And you said it’s not painful, just a feeling of fullness quickly?
PATIENT: That’s right. No pain, no sickness, nothing like that. Just… full. Like someone put a small stone in my stomach, maybe? It’s a strange feeling to explain, honestly. My wife keeps offering me little snacks, thinking I’m not eating enough, but even a biscuit is too much sometimes. It’s been a bit worrying, to be honest.
DOCTOR: I understand. It is worrying when your appetite changes like that, especially when it’s affecting your ability to eat. Now, has your weight changed at all in the last few months?
PATIENT: Well… yes, actually. My wife keeps reminding me. I’ve lost a little bit, I think. Not a huge amount, but enough that she noticed. She's a good woman, always looking after me. I haven’t weighed myself, though. I leave that to her. She’ll tell me if it’s something to be concerned about, she always does. I reckon maybe five or ten pounds, at a guess? It’s hard to say, I don’t pay much attention to numbers these days.
DOCTOR: Okay, some weight loss. And aside from the fullness and weight loss, have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Let me see… not really, I don't think. I’ve been a bit tired, maybe. But I’m eighty-eight years old, Doctor, a bit of tiredness comes with the territory! I haven't had any trouble with… well, with going to the bathroom, if you don't mind me saying. And no pain anywhere else, no sickness, no… anything else that springs to mind, really. Just the full feeling and the weight loss. It’s a bit of a mystery, isn't it?
DOCTOR: It is a bit of a puzzle, yes, but we’ll try to figure it out. Now, do you have any trouble swallowing?
PATIENT: Trouble swallowing? No, not at all. Food goes down just fine. It's not that it feels stuck, it's just… once it’s in there, I'm done. Like a little switch flips and says “no more.” It’s a bit hard to explain, I know. My wife says I'm a terrible patient, always rambling.
DOCTOR: No, you’re explaining perfectly fine, Mr. Obarr. And don't worry, rambling is perfectly normal. It helps me get a better picture. Now, have you noticed any nausea or vomiting at all?
PATIENT: No, thankfully not. No sickness at all. Never been much of a sick person, to be honest. Always been pretty robust, right up until… well, until this started. It’s just… unsettling. I enjoy my food, you see. And now it’s like… I’m losing that enjoyment, bit by bit. It's a small thing, maybe, but it’s bothering me. I've always liked a good salmon bake, especially. Now, even thinking about it doesn’t quite… appeal.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s important to enjoy your meals, and it’s certainly concerning when that enjoyment is affected. Okay, let’s talk about your medical history. Do you have any past medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Well, let me see… I had my appendix out when I was a young man, a long, long time ago. And I had a bit of trouble with my heart, years back. They gave me some medication for it, but I haven’t taken anything for years now. The doctor said it had cleared up, that I was a lucky one. Aside from that… not much, really. I’ve always been pretty healthy, all things considered. I used to spend a lot of time outdoors, fishing and hunting with my father. Good exercise, that was.
DOCTOR: Okay, appendectomy and past heart trouble. Do you remember what medication you were taking for your heart?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. It was a long time ago, Doctor, and my memory isn't what it used to be. I think… I think it was something with a “pril” at the end of the name? Something like… Lisinopril? Or something similar. I'm really not sure. My wife might remember, she always kept track of those things. I just did what the doctor told me.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Mr. Obarr. We can look that up. And do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. My wife always double-checks when I get a new prescription, just to be safe, but I've never had any trouble. I don’t take any medications regularly at the moment, aside from a little something for my arthritis now and then, but that’s all. Just a little cream, nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies and just arthritis cream as needed. Now, what about your family history?
PATIENT: Well, my mother lived to be ninety-five, a very strong woman. She was always active, even in her old age. My father… he passed away when he was in his seventies, I think. He had a bit of trouble with his heart, actually. And my brother… he had diabetes, but he passed away a few years back. So, heart trouble and diabetes… those are the main things, I suppose. We weren’t a particularly sickly family, though. Mostly just lived long lives.
DOCTOR: Okay, mother with longevity, father with heart trouble, brother with diabetes. Now, let’s talk about your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, never smoked a day in my life. My father always warned me about it. And I don’t drink alcohol either. Never really appealed to me. And certainly no recreational drugs! I was raised a respectable Haida man, Doctor. Always been a pretty straight life, all things considered. I enjoy a good cup of tea, though. And I spend a lot of time with my wife, that’s my main enjoyment now.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. Now, to get a better understanding of what’s going on, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. Just listening to your heart and lungs, feeling your abdomen, things like that. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgement. Go right ahead. I’ve got nothing to hide!
DOCTOR: Alright, let’s listen to your heart and lungs… everything sounds fairly normal there, a slightly age-related murmur, but nothing concerning. Now, feeling your abdomen… it’s soft, but I do notice a slight tenderness in your upper abdomen. Not painful, but noticeable. Do you ever experience any bloating or gas?
PATIENT: Hmm… yes, actually. Now that you mention it, I have been a bit gassy lately, more so than usual. And yes, a bit of bloating sometimes, especially after I eat. Not terrible, mind you, but noticeable. I just figured it was my old stomach acting up.
DOCTOR: Alright, bloating and gas. That’s helpful. Now, I’m going to listen to your bowel sounds… They’re a bit quiet, actually. Not absent, but reduced. Given your symptoms – the early fullness, weight loss, tenderness, bloating, and quiet bowel sounds – it sounds like we need to investigate a bit further. I'd like to order some blood work, including a complete blood count and a metabolic panel. Also, a stool test to rule out any infection. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds sensible, Doctor. Whatever tests you think are necessary. I trust you. I want to get to the bottom of this, you know? It’s unsettling not knowing what’s going on. Blood work and a stool test… alright. Just let me know what I need to do.
DOCTOR: Excellent. The nurse will come in shortly and take some blood, and I’ll give you instructions for collecting the stool sample. It’s fairly straightforward. These tests will help us rule out a few things and give us a clearer picture of what’s going on. In the meantime, I'm going to recommend a bland diet – things like toast, rice, bananas, and applesauce – to see if that helps reduce the bloating and discomfort. And try to eat smaller, more frequent meals. We’ll review the results as soon as they come in, and then we’ll discuss the next steps. Does that sound alright, Mr. Obarr?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds very reasonable, Doctor. A bland diet and smaller meals… I can certainly manage that. Toast, rice, bananas… my wife makes a lovely banana bread. I'll stick to that for now. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me, and for explaining everything so clearly. It puts my mind at ease knowing we're getting to the bottom of this.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Obarr. It’s my pleasure. And don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or if your symptoms worsen. We’ll get this sorted out. The nurse will be in shortly. Do you have any questions for me before she arrives?
PATIENT: No, I think you’ve covered everything, Doctor. I appreciate your kindness and your thoroughness. I'll just wait for the nurse, then. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: Alright, excellent. I’ll leave you to it then, Mr. Obarr. Take care, and we'll be in touch soon with the results.
