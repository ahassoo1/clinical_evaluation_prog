DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Komarov. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Chagaris. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. Nice to meet you as well. Well, it’s this light sensitivity, really. It's been bothering me for a bit now. Everything just seems…too bright, you know? Makes my eyes ache.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. Light sensitivity can be quite bothersome. Could you tell me a little more about when this started?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think… it started maybe… three months ago? Around late April, I’d say. It wasn’t bad at first, just a little discomfort. But it’s gotten steadily worse since then, especially with the summer sun. I remember noticing it really badly when I was helping my neighbor with his garden. It was a really bright day.
DOCTOR: Okay, three months ago, around late April, and it’s been gradually worsening, particularly with bright sunlight. And you noticed it acutely while gardening. Does the sensitivity affect your vision in any way – do things appear blurry, or are there any other changes to how you see?
PATIENT: No, thankfully not blurry. It doesn’t change what I see, just… how bright everything is. Like, even on a cloudy day, the light can feel too intense. And sometimes it feels like there's a little bit of a glare around things, you know? Not all the time, but it happens. It doesn't make it hard to see things, just… uncomfortable. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. So, it’s more of a discomfort and increased sensitivity to light, with occasional glare, but your vision itself remains clear. Have you noticed this sensitivity being worse at any particular time of day, or with specific types of light – like fluorescent lights versus sunlight, for example?
PATIENT: Oh, good question. Yes, actually. It's definitely worse in the afternoon. The sun feels stronger then, I guess. And fluorescent lights… yeah, those really bother me. Like in the supermarket, or even some offices. Sunlight isn't great, but the fluorescent lights are much worse. It feels like they’re buzzing right in my eyes, if that makes any sense. I find myself squinting a lot.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s very helpful. Worse in the afternoon and particularly with fluorescent lights… and you’re squinting as a result. Have you experienced any other symptoms along with this light sensitivity?
PATIENT: Let me think… not really. No headaches, no blurry vision like I said before, no pain… Just the sensitivity, and the squinting. Oh! Actually, my eyes do feel a little dry sometimes, especially when they're bothering me. But I thought that was just because I spend a lot of time reading. I do love a good book. But now that you mention it, maybe it’s connected?
DOCTOR: That’s good information. Dry eyes alongside the sensitivity is certainly worth noting. Let’s talk a bit about your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions that we should be aware of?
PATIENT: Not really. I’m generally pretty healthy. I had high blood pressure for a bit, maybe ten years ago, but it’s been well controlled with medication for years now. Other than that… just the usual aches and pains of getting older, I suppose. Oh, and I wear glasses for reading, like I mentioned. But that's about it. I lost my wife a few years back, but that wasn't an illness, just… a sad thing. Do you need to know anything specific?
DOCTOR: I’m very sorry to hear about your wife. It’s good to know you’ve been managing your blood pressure well with medication. Okay, so controlled hypertension and reading glasses. Have you ever had any eye surgeries or injuries?
PATIENT: No, never. No surgeries, no injuries. I've always been pretty careful. I'm a bit of a klutz sometimes, but thankfully nothing serious has ever happened to my eyes. I wear the glasses, of course, but those were just fitted by the optometrist, nothing surgical.
DOCTOR: Okay, no eye surgeries or injuries. And you've been managing your hypertension for years. Do you have any allergies to medications, or any known drug sensitivities?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of. I've taken a few different medications over the years for colds and things, but nothing has ever caused a reaction. I'm pretty lucky that way, I guess. My wife, bless her, she had a few sensitivities, but I haven’t had any trouble myself.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. And you're currently taking medication for your blood pressure, correct?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. I take Lisinopril, 10mg, once a day. Been on it for… oh, must be seven or eight years now. It keeps things steady, thankfully. No problems with that medication either.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril 10mg daily. That’s helpful to know. Now, let's talk about your family history. Are there any eye conditions – like glaucoma, macular degeneration, or cataracts – that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm, that’s a good question. Let me think… My mother had cataracts, I think. She had surgery for them when she was quite old, maybe in her eighties. My father… I don’t really recall anything specific about his eyes. He passed away when I was young. And my wife’s family… I don't think so, not that I remember. She didn’t talk much about her family's medical history. It's a little fuzzy, to be honest. I'm not very good at remembering those details.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of cataracts in your mother. That’s good information to have. Now, a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: No, never. I've never touched a cigarette in my life. My wife used to smoke, but she quit years ago. She always said it was a terrible habit. I always agreed with her! I try to eat pretty healthy too, lots of fruits and vegetables. Though I do have a bit of a sweet tooth, I must admit. Chocolate is my weakness.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent. Non-smoker, healthy diet, and a weakness for chocolate – I understand that perfectly! One last question before we do a quick examination. Do you spend a lot of time in front of screens – computer, phone, television?
PATIENT: Yes, I do, actually. I like to keep up with the news, and I video chat with my nephew in America quite often. So probably a few hours a day in front of a screen. Maybe three or four hours, if I’m being honest. And I read eBooks on my tablet too. It's convenient, you see. Oh, and I watch a bit of television in the evening. Not as much as I used to, but still… a few hours a day, I suppose. Is that a problem?
DOCTOR: Okay, several hours a day in front of screens. That’s good to know. All right, Mr. Komarov. Based on what you've told me, and reviewing your chart, it sounds like you're experiencing light sensitivity, possibly with some dryness, worsened by fluorescent lights and afternoon sun, and potentially related to screen time. Now, I'd like to do a quick eye examination just to assess your vision and the health of your eyes. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly fine, Doctor. Absolutely. Please, go ahead. I’m happy to do whatever you need. I’m trusting you to figure out what’s going on.
DOCTOR: Excellent. First, let's check your visual acuity. Could you please read the letters on this chart, starting with both eyes open?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Let me see… okay, um… that first line… I can read all of those. "E… F… P… T…" And the next line… "C… D… H… N…" Is that right? Should I keep going?
DOCTOR: Yes, please keep going. "C… D… H… N…” Good. Now the next line?
PATIENT: Okay… um… that one is a little blurry… let me try… “E… F… P… V…” Oh, and I think I can just make out that last letter… “Z.” It’s a little difficult, though. Is that right? Should I try one more line?
DOCTOR: Yes, please. Now I’m going to shine a light into your eyes to look at the back of your eye. This won't be painful, but it can be a little bright. Please just look straight ahead. Okay, good red reflex bilaterally. I’m seeing some mild dryness of the conjunctiva in both eyes. The optic discs look healthy, with good color and sharp margins. No signs of papilledema. No hemorrhages or exudates noted. The retinas appear normal, with no evidence of macular degeneration or other significant pathology. Now I’ll take a closer look at the front of your eyes.
PATIENT: Okay, that light was a little bright, but not too bad. And yes, I feel like my eyes are a little dry sometimes, you’re right. And yes, go ahead with the closer look. Whatever you need to do. I trust your judgment, Doctor. Let me know if you see anything concerning.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Komarov. Your cornea appears clear bilaterally. I’m seeing no evidence of cataracts in either lens, which is good. Your irises are normal in appearance. I do see some mild meibomian gland dysfunction in both eyes, which can contribute to dryness. Okay, so based on my examination, your visual acuity is slightly reduced, but within normal limits. You have mild dryness, which is likely due to the meibomian gland dysfunction. This is quite common, especially with increased screen time and fluorescent light exposure. It's not typically a cause for major concern, but it can be quite uncomfortable.
PATIENT: Okay, that’s good to know. Mild dryness… and something about glands. I suppose that makes sense. I do spend a lot of time looking at screens, like you said. So, it's not anything serious? Just… uncomfortable? What can I do about it, Doctor? Is there anything I can take, or… a drop perhaps?
DOCTOR: No, it doesn't appear to be anything serious, thankfully. Just a common cause of discomfort. The mild meibomian gland dysfunction means your eyes aren't producing enough oil to keep them lubricated properly. We can definitely address this. I recommend a few things: 1. Artificial tears: Use over-the-counter artificial tears frequently throughout the day, especially when you’re using screens. I recommend preservative-free drops, as those are less likely to cause irritation with frequent use. 2. Warm compresses: Apply a warm compress to your eyelids for 5-10 minutes once or twice a day. This helps to loosen the oil in the meibomian glands. 3. Eyelid hygiene: Gently clean your eyelids with a mild eyelid cleanser or diluted baby shampoo. This removes debris that can block the glands. 4. Blink frequently: Consciously make an effort to blink more often, especially when using screens. Blinking helps to spread the tear film evenly across your eyes. 5. Screen time breaks: Follow the 20-20-20 rule: Every 20 minutes, look at something 20 feet away for 20 seconds. I’m also going to prescribe you a mild lubricating eye ointment to use at bedtime to help keep your eyes moisturized overnight.
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds… manageable. Artificial tears, warm compresses, cleaning my eyelids, blinking more… I can try all of that. It's good to know there's something I can do about it. And ointment at bedtime, that sounds nice. Is there a brand you recommend for the tears, Doctor? And for the cleaning, you said diluted baby shampoo? How diluted? I don’t want to get it in my eyes.
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely. For artificial tears, I recommend Systane Ultra or Refresh Tears. Both are readily available and well-tolerated by most patients. As for the eyelid cleanser, you can use any mild baby shampoo – just dilute it significantly. I recommend mixing one part baby shampoo with ten parts water. So, one teaspoon of shampoo with ten teaspoons of water. Gently massage the diluted shampoo onto your closed eyelids, then rinse thoroughly with warm water. Be careful to avoid getting the shampoo directly in your eyes, but a little bit of rinse is perfectly fine. Here's a handout with detailed instructions for eyelid hygiene, just in case. It also covers warm compresses. I'm prescribing the lubricating ointment now. It's a simple ointment you apply a small amount to your lower eyelid at bedtime. It will feel a little greasy initially, but that should subside as you sleep. It will help keep your eyes moisturized overnight and reduce dryness in the morning. I'd like to see you back in six weeks to assess your progress. If your symptoms worsen or don't improve, please schedule an appointment sooner. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: Okay, that’s very helpful. Systane Ultra, one part shampoo to ten parts water… I think I can remember that. Six weeks… yes, I’ll schedule an appointment. No, I think that covers everything, Doctor. Thank you very much for your time, and for explaining everything so clearly. I feel much better knowing what's going on, and what I can do about it. And thank you for being so patient with me. I appreciate it.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Komarov. I’m glad I could help. Please don’t hesitate to contact the office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. Have a good day, and take care of your eyes! The prescription will be sent to your pharmacy shortly.
PATIENT: .
