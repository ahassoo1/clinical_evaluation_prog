DOCTOR: Good morning, Ellan. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Auelua. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… Rannells, actually. Ellan Rannells. And frankly, I shouldn’t need to explain what brings me in. It’s this… modern nonsense, this medical marijuana. My husband, bless his heart, thinks it might help with his arthritis, and I’m here to… well, to get whatever paperwork is required. I still think a good liniment is better, but… one has to humor their spouse, you know?
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand completely, Ellan. It’s good of you to come in and discuss this. So, to clarify, you're looking for information and potentially documentation regarding medical marijuana for your husband's arthritis?
PATIENT: Precisely. Though I must say, I find it rather… undignified, discussing this with a doctor. It all feels terribly… illicit, even though I understand it’s perfectly legal now. Is there a form I need to fill out? And frankly, I expect a thorough explanation of any… side effects. I’ve heard stories, you know. People becoming quite…addled.
DOCTOR: I completely understand your concerns, Ellan. It is a relatively new area, and it's natural to feel a bit uneasy. We can absolutely go through everything thoroughly. There is some paperwork involved – a patient form outlining the requirements for certification, and then we'd need to discuss your husband’s medical history to ensure it’s appropriate for him. Before we get to the paperwork, let’s talk a bit more about his arthritis. Could you tell me a little about it?
PATIENT: Well, it’s in his knees, mostly. He used to be a very active man, a carpenter, you see. Very strong hands. But that was years ago. Now, getting up and down is… a struggle. He complains of pain, of course, and stiffness. He’s tried… various creams, as I said. And pills, the doctor gave him pills, but they didn’t quite do the trick. And frankly, they made him sleepy. Utterly useless if you ask me. He’s been suffering for… oh, I suppose five years now? Maybe six. It’s hard to keep track, you know. At our age.
DOCTOR: I understand. Five or six years is a long time to deal with that kind of discomfort. And it sounds like he’s already tried some common treatments without much success. You mentioned pills made him sleepy. Do you recall what type of pills those were, if you don't mind me asking?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no. I don’t pay attention to those things. My husband handles all the medication. He went to Dr. Henderson, you see, before he… well, before he retired. A perfectly good doctor, but a bit… rushed, if you ask me. I just remember they were little white pills. And they didn’t work. He’d take them and then nap all afternoon. What good is that to a man who enjoys his garden? Honestly. It’s a waste of time, frankly. I'd rather he just toughen up a bit. But… one tries to be understanding.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s good that he’s been under a doctor’s care previously. Even knowing they were little white pills is helpful, it gives us a starting point. It sounds like finding something that doesn't cause drowsiness is important for him. Now, besides his knees, has he had any pain in other joints?
PATIENT: Well, sometimes his hands bother him. Not constantly, but after a day of… fiddling about in the garden, he complains of aching. It’s the dampness, I think. It gets into his bones. And his back, occasionally. He used to lift very heavy things, you know, as a carpenter. All that bending and straining. Now, even a simple task like raking leaves leaves him hobbling about. He’s getting old, I suppose. It’s just… disheartening to see him struggle. He used to be so strong.
DOCTOR: It sounds like the pain is fairly widespread, affecting his hands and back as well, and likely exacerbated by activity and the weather. That certainly paints a clearer picture. Has he had any other medical conditions diagnosed over the years, if you know?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think. He had his prostate checked, of course. All men do, at a certain age. And… his blood pressure is a bit high, I believe. He takes a pill for that. A little pink one. And… he had a touch of pneumonia a few years back. Not serious, thankfully. He recovered well, but he’s never been quite the same since. A bit… weaker, you see. Everything seems to go at once, doesn't it? One thing leads to another. I wish he’d just eat more vegetables. That’s what his mother always said. But men… they never listen.
DOCTOR: That’s very common, Ellan. It sounds like he’s managed his prostate and blood pressure with medication. And recovering from pneumonia can certainly take a toll. So, to summarise, he has a history of high blood pressure, had pneumonia previously, and has pain in his knees, hands, and sometimes his back. Now, just to be thorough, does he have any allergies to medications, or any other allergies you’re aware of?
PATIENT: Hmm. Allergies… not that I know of. He doesn’t seem to react to anything. He’s a pretty robust man, generally. He used to eat everything, you see. Shellfish, nuts, all sorts of things. He’s a bit more careful now, but he’s never had a serious reaction. No hives, no swelling, nothing like that. Though… he does get a bit sniffly in the springtime, if there are a lot of flowers blooming. But that’s just hay fever, I think. Everyone gets that, don’t they? It’s not a proper allergy. Honestly, people make such a fuss over everything these days.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known medication or significant allergies. Just seasonal hay fever. That's good to know. Now, before we discuss medical marijuana specifically, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline assessment of his joints and overall health. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Well… I suppose so. Though I don’t see what poking and prodding will accomplish. He’s an old man, Doctor. He’s going to ache, regardless. But… if you think it’s necessary, I won’t object. Just be gentle, please. And don’t keep him waiting too long. He gets impatient, you know. And I have a luncheon date afterwards. With my book club. It's a very important discussion, you see. We’re reading… oh, it doesn’t matter what we’re reading. Just… be quick.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ellan. I'll be as quick and gentle as possible. I just want to assess his range of motion and look for any swelling or tenderness. It will only take a few minutes. If you don't mind, could he sit on the examination table?
PATIENT: Very well. Arthur, dear. The Doctor wants to… poke and prod you. Try not to complain too much. And don't fall off the table. Honestly, at your age… There. Now, get on with it, Doctor. I haven't got all day.
DOCTOR: Alright, Arthur. Just relax for me. I’m just going to listen to your heart and lungs first. Sounds good. Now, could you tell me if you have any pain in your knees right now?
PATIENT: Always aches, Doctor. Always. Worse when it's damp, worse when I move. But it’s there, simmering away, all the time. Like a bad temper. There. See? Even just standing is a struggle. And don't expect me to bend, I won't do it. Not for anyone. I’m too old for this nonsense. But... if you must, just be quick about it. And careful. I bruise easily, you know. It's a terrible affliction.
DOCTOR: I understand. Constant pain, exacerbated by movement and dampness. I’ll be very gentle. Okay, Arthur, I’m just going to feel around your knees now. Tell me if anything feels particularly tender. Hmm. There’s a little bit of crepitus – that’s a sort of grating sound – and some tenderness here on the inside of your right knee. Nothing too significant, but it’s worth noting. Now, let's check your range of motion. Could you try to bend your knees as far as you comfortably can?
PATIENT: There. As far as I can go. And it’s not very far, I assure you. It feels like rusty hinges, Doctor. All stiff and creaky. Don’t expect miracles. I haven't been able to bend properly in years. Honestly, poking and prodding won't change anything. I know my own body, you see. It's failing, slowly but surely. And straightening them isn't much easier, I assure you. It's a constant battle, this getting older business. A constant, aching battle. Just write it down, Doctor. It all aches. There. Now, can we be done? I’m starting to feel faint. It’s the indignity of it all, you see.
DOCTOR: Alright, Arthur, that’s enough for now. I understand your discomfort, and I appreciate your patience. So, to summarise, Arthur has some crepitus and mild tenderness in his right knee, with limited range of motion in both knees. His heart and lungs sound clear. Based on this examination, it appears he has some degree of osteoarthritis in his knees, which is not surprising given his age and history of manual labor. Now, let's talk about medical marijuana. Do you have any specific questions or concerns about it?
PATIENT: Well… I suppose I should ask what exactly it does. I mean, I’ve heard stories, you know. People becoming… giggly and unproductive. My husband is a sensible man, generally. I wouldn’t want him becoming some sort of… bohemian. And what about side effects? Will it interfere with his blood pressure medication? And… what form does it take? Do I have to… smoke it? Because I absolutely will not have that in the house. It’s a terrible habit, and I’ve always disapproved. Honestly, the whole thing sounds rather… dubious. But if it can alleviate his pain without turning him into a… a character, I suppose I’m willing to consider it. But explain it to me, Doctor. In plain English, please. None of that medical jargon.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ellan. Those are all very reasonable questions, and I’m happy to explain everything in plain English. Medical marijuana, or cannabis, contains compounds called cannabinoids. The two main ones are THC and CBD. THC is the one that causes the psychoactive effects – the “high” people talk about. CBD doesn't cause a high, but it can help with pain, inflammation, and anxiety. For arthritis, we'd likely focus on products with a higher CBD content and a lower THC content, to minimize any psychoactive effects. It's about finding the right balance. As for how it’s taken, you don’t have to smoke it. There are many other options available: oils, tinctures – those are liquid drops you take under the tongue – edibles like gummies, and topical creams you apply directly to the skin. We'd start with a low dose of a tincture or cream, and gradually increase it until we find a dose that provides relief without causing unwanted side effects. Regarding your concerns about side effects and interactions with his blood pressure medication, those are important. Potential side effects can include drowsiness, dizziness, dry mouth, and changes in appetite. It can interact with some medications, so it’s crucial to discuss all of his current medications with the pharmacist before starting anything. We'd also monitor his blood pressure closely. We’d also start with a very low dose to see how he reacts. It’s not a magic bullet, and it doesn’t work for everyone. But it can be a helpful option for managing chronic pain. Does that make sense so far?
PATIENT: Hmm. Oils and creams… that sounds more acceptable than… smoke. And a low dose, carefully monitored… yes, that’s what I was hoping for. But what about legality? I don’t want to get Arthur into trouble with the law. And… what if it doesn't work? Will I be stuck with a cupboard full of… oils? And… is it expensive? Honestly, my husband is on a fixed income. We can't afford to waste money on something that won't help. You see, I'm a practical woman. I need to know all the facts before I commit to anything. And… will it affect his thinking? He still enjoys reading, you see. And doing crossword puzzles. I wouldn’t want to deprive him of those pleasures. Honestly, this whole thing is rather complicated. Explain it to me like I’m five, Doctor. Please.
DOCTOR: You're absolutely right to ask all these questions, Ellan. You are being very practical, and it's good you're thinking everything through. Let's break it down like you're five. Legality: yes, it's perfectly legal in our state for patients with qualifying conditions, like chronic pain, to use medical marijuana with a certification from a doctor. It's not like it used to be. What if it doesn’t work?
PATIENT: Yes, that's what I meant. What if it's a waste of money? Will I be stuck with a cupboard full of…expensive oils and creams? And will it affect his mind? He enjoys his crossword puzzles, you see. And reading. He’s a very intelligent man. I wouldn't want to deprive him of those pleasures. Honestly, this whole thing is rather complicated. And what about the smell? I don’t want the house smelling like… a head shop. My book club would never forgive me. Explain it to me, Doctor. In plain English. Please.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ellan. Let's tackle everything, one by one. First, the cost: medical marijuana can be expensive, but it doesn’t have to be. We’d start with a small amount to see if it works, and we can adjust the dose and form based on his needs and your budget. We can also look into patient assistance programs or discounts. It doesn't have to be a cupboard full of expensive products if it doesn’t work. Now, regarding his mind: that's a very important concern. High doses of THC can affect thinking and memory, but with a low dose of a CBD-dominant product, that's less likely. We'd start with a very low dose and monitor him closely for any changes in his cognitive function. If he experiences any problems, we’d stop immediately. We want to improve his quality of life, not impair his abilities. And finally, the smell: you're right to be concerned about that. Some products do have a strong odor, but there are odorless options available, like capsules or topical creams. We can recommend products that are discreet and won't bother your book club. To summarise: we'd start with a low dose of a CBD-dominant product, monitor him closely for any side effects or changes in his cognitive function, and recommend products that fit your budget and preferences. It’s a trial and error process, and we’d work together to find the best solution for him. Does that address your concerns?
PATIENT: Hmm. A trial and error process… that sounds… reasonable. And a low dose, carefully monitored… yes, that’s what I was hoping for. And odorless options… that’s good. My book club would never forgive me if the house smelled like… a head shop. But… what about driving? He still likes to drive to the library. Will it affect his ability to drive safely? And what about interactions with his other medications? He takes pills for his blood pressure, you see. And his prostate. I wouldn’t want anything to interfere with those. Honestly, this whole thing is rather complicated. Explain it to me, Doctor. In plain English. Please. And… what’s the next step if we decide to try it? Will I have to fill out a lot of paperwork? My hands aren't what they used to be, you see. It’s very difficult for me to write these days.
DOCTOR: You’re right to ask about driving, Ellan, and the interactions with his other medications. Those are very important concerns. Driving: absolutely, he should not drive if he’s using marijuana. It can impair his judgment and reaction time, even with a low dose. We'd advise him to avoid driving altogether while he's trying it. Medication interactions: that’s why a thorough medication review is crucial. We’ll send his medication list to the pharmacist to check for any potential interactions. It’s possible that marijuana could interact with his blood pressure or prostate medications, so it’s important to be cautious. We’d monitor his blood pressure closely and watch for any side effects. As for the next steps, yes, there is some paperwork involved. It's a patient form outlining his medical history and qualifying condition. I can help you fill it out, or we can have a nurse assist you. We can also provide a large-print version if that would be easier. It shouldn’t take too long, and we can take it slow. If we decide to proceed, I’ll provide you with a certification, and you can then visit a licensed dispensary to purchase medical marijuana. I'll give you a list of reputable dispensaries in the area. We can then schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss his progress and adjust the dose as needed. Does that sound manageable?
PATIENT: Hmm. A follow-up appointment… that’s good. I like the idea of being monitored closely. And a list of reputable dispensaries… yes, that’s helpful. I wouldn’t want to go to some… shady establishment. But… what if it makes him paranoid? He’s a bit of a worrier, you see. He gets anxious easily. I wouldn’t want him becoming… delusional. And what about addiction? I’ve heard stories about people becoming… dependent on it. Honestly, this whole thing sounds rather risky. Explain it to me, Doctor. In plain English. Please. And… can I bring my husband to the next appointment? He’s probably better at filling out forms than I am. Honestly, my hands aren’t what they used to be, you see. It’s very difficult for me to write these days.
DOCTOR: Those are very valid concerns, Ellan. It’s good you’re thinking about all the potential risks. Paranoia: yes, high doses of THC can cause paranoia and anxiety in some people, especially those who are prone to worrying. That’s why we’d start with a very low dose of a CBD-dominant product, which is less likely to cause those side effects. We’d also monitor him closely for any changes in his mental state. If he experiences any paranoia or anxiety, we’d stop immediately. Addiction: the risk of addiction with medical marijuana is relatively low, especially compared to other drugs. However, it’s still possible to become dependent on it, especially if it’s used frequently and in high doses. That’s why we’d start with a low dose and use it only as needed. We’d also monitor him closely for any signs of dependence. Yes, absolutely, you can bring your husband to the next appointment. It’s probably best if he fills out the forms, and he can also share his experiences with me directly. So, to summarise: we’d start with a low dose of a CBD-dominant product, monitor him closely for any side effects, and use it only as needed. You can bring your husband to the next appointment, and he can help with the paperwork. Does that sound like a reasonable plan?
PATIENT: Hmm. A reasonable plan… yes, that sounds… acceptable. And bringing my husband to the next appointment… that’s good. He’s better at filling out forms than I am. Honestly, my hands aren’t what they used to be, you see. It’s very difficult for me to write these days. Alright, Doctor. Let’s proceed with the paperwork, then. But… slowly, please. And… could we perhaps have a comfortable chair? My back isn’t what it used to be, you see. And… could we have a glass of water? It’s very warm in here. Honestly, this whole thing is rather exhausting. But… thank you for explaining everything so patiently, Doctor. You’ve been very helpful. Now, where do we begin?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ellan. We can take things as slow as you need, and I’ll make sure you have a comfortable chair and a glass of water. Here you go. And here's the paperwork. It’s a fairly standard form, but feel free to ask me any questions as you go through it. We can start with your husband’s medical history. Just fill in the information as best as you can. Don't worry if you don't remember everything. We can take breaks whenever you need them. I’m happy to help with anything. Let’s begin when you’re ready.
