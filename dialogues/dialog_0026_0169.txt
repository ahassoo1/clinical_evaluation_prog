DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Miner. I’m Dr. Finco. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning to you too, Doctor. Finco, you say? Hmm. Well, it’s this… puffiness, I suppose. Face and legs, mostly. Been getting worse lately. Not sure why, though. Doctors these days… always want to know why. It just is, sometimes.
DOCTOR: Yes, well, understanding why can often help us figure out the best way to address things, but you’re right, sometimes things just… develop. Puffiness, you said – face and legs. And you mentioned it's been worsening recently. Could you tell me a little more about when you first noticed it, and how it’s been progressing?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. When… that’s a tricky one. Seems like it started… well, after my wife passed, I reckon. It's all a bit of a blur, to be honest. She always handled the… keeping track of things. It’s just slowly gotten bigger, I suppose. Hard to say exactly when, but definitely noticeable now. It used to just be my ankles swelling at the end of the day, now it's… all over. Both sides, mind you. Not just one leg. Makes putting on socks a real chore, it does.
DOCTOR: I’m very sorry to hear about your wife. Grief can certainly manifest in many ways, and it's not uncommon for physical symptoms to arise during times of stress. So, this swelling started after her passing and has gradually increased… both legs and now your face as well. And it makes putting on socks difficult. To get a better understanding, could you describe the puffiness a bit more?
PATIENT: Oh, it's not like a big, hard lump or anything. More… soft. Like dough, maybe? Especially in the morning, it's the worst. Then it kinda… settles a bit throughout the day, but never goes away completely. And it's… kinda shiny, I guess? I don't know, I'm not a doctor, like I said. It’s just… puffy. You can press on it, and it leaves a little dent, but it bounces back… eventually. Not quickly, though. It’s just… unpleasant, that’s what it is. Makes me look… bloated. Not a good look for a Swede, you know. We're supposed to be lean and hardy.
DOCTOR: “Soft, like dough, worse in the morning, settles during the day…shiny, leaves a dent that slowly bounces back.” That’s very helpful, thank you. So, it’s not painful, just… unpleasant and noticeable. Now, have you noticed any other changes along with the swelling?
PATIENT: No, not really. I get a little… short of breath sometimes, but I always have. Old lungs, you know? Smoked a bit too much when I was younger. Though I quit years ago, of course. And I feel a bit tired, but who doesn't these days? It could be anything, really. I haven’t been sleeping great, thinking about things… but that's probably just the wife, to be honest. No, just the puffiness, really. That's what bothered me enough to finally come in. It's getting hard to tie my shoes, it is. And my trousers feel tighter, which is just… embarrassing.
DOCTOR: Okay, so some shortness of breath that you've had for a while, and tiredness. You mentioned you haven't been sleeping well either. And the swelling is making it difficult to tie your shoes and your trousers feel tighter. Let's do a quick examination. I'd like to listen to your heart and lungs, and take a look at your legs and face. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, alright. Go ahead. Don’t expect much, though. I’m a bit of a mess, I’m afraid. Old age, you know. Not much good left in this body. Just hope you can figure something out, Doctor. This puffiness is… unsettling. Makes me feel… weak. And I don't like feeling weak. A Swede should be strong, you know. Strong and silent. Not puffy and breathless.
DOCTOR: Strength comes in many forms, Mr. Miner. And we'll do our best to figure things out. Now, if you could just lie down here for me… Alright. Your heart sounds a bit… muffled, but no significant irregularities that I can detect right now. Your lungs have some… diminished breath sounds, which isn’t entirely surprising given your smoking history. And yes, I can definitely see and feel the swelling in your legs and face. There is some pitting edema, meaning the dent remains for a few seconds after I press on your skin. So, muffled heart sounds, diminished breath sounds, and pitting edema in your legs and face. To get a clearer picture, I think it would be helpful to run some blood tests. We can check your kidney function, liver function, and also look for any signs of infection or inflammation. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Blood tests, eh? Always poking and prodding. Never liked needles. But… if you think it's necessary, go ahead. Might as well get it over with. Just… don’t take too much, alright? I'm a bit anemic, you know. Don't want to end up feeling even weaker. And tell me what it all means, Doctor. Don’t just give me a list of numbers. I don't speak doctor-language. Just… tell me plainly what's going on. And quickly, if you can. This is… unsettling, it really is.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Miner. We’ll only take what’s necessary, and I’ll explain everything in plain language, no doctor-speak, I promise. We'll check a few things – your kidney and liver function, and look for anything that might be causing the swelling. The lab is just down the hall, second door on the left. They'll draw a small amount of blood. It should only take a few minutes. Then, we'll wait for the results and discuss them. While we're waiting, is there anything else you’d like to tell me?
PATIENT: Nah, I think that's about it. Just… this puffiness. It's… bothersome. Makes me feel old. And weak. Like I'm falling apart. I used to be able to… well, never mind. It doesn't matter now. Just get those tests done, and tell me what's going on. Quickly, if you can. I don't like feeling like this. I’m a Swede, you know. We're supposed to be… resilient. Not puffy and breathless.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Miner. We will do our best to figure things out. You go ahead and get those tests done, and I'll be here when you return. .
