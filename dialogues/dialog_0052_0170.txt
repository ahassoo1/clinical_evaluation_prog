DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Putney. My name is Dr. Shely. It's a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. Could you please tell me what brings you in to the clinic?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just… this life insurance thing. They need me to get checked out, that’s all. Want to get it over with quick, if that’s okay.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Putney. I understand wanting to be efficient with your time. We'll do our best to keep things moving along. Just to clarify, this is specifically for a life insurance application, and not related to any current illness or symptoms you’re experiencing?
PATIENT: No, no sickness. Just the insurance company being… careful. Everything's fine, I think. They just sent me here. Don't really know why they need all this checked, honestly.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful to know. Insurance companies often require a baseline medical evaluation as part of their application process. We’ll perform a standard check-up to provide them with the necessary information. Let’s start with a little bit of background. Have you been seeing any other doctors regularly, or have you had any significant illnesses or hospitalizations in the past?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Not really regularly. I went to the emergency room once, a few years back. Fell off a ladder while fixing my roof. Broke my wrist. Other than that… I think that’s it. Nothing major, nothing ongoing. Just the usual colds, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright, a fractured wrist a few years ago. Do you recall the approximate date of that injury, Mr. Putney?
PATIENT: Ugh, dates. Let me see… it was… summer of 2022, I think? Maybe July? It was hot, I remember that much. Had to get a cast on. Kept me off work for a couple weeks.
DOCTOR: Okay, summer of 2022, wrist fracture requiring a cast. And you've fully recovered from that, with no ongoing pain or limitations?
PATIENT: Yeah, fully recovered. No problems with it at all. Sometimes it feels a little stiff when it's cold, but that's it. Nothing I worry about.
DOCTOR: Good. And has anyone in your family – parents, siblings, children – had any significant medical conditions, such as heart disease, diabetes, cancer, or other chronic illnesses?
PATIENT: My mom… she had diabetes. Type 2, I think? She passed away a few years ago. And my dad, he had high blood pressure. He's still around, though. Living on the outer islands, mostly keeps to himself. That’s about it, really. No one else I can think of with anything serious.
DOCTOR: Thank you, that's helpful information. Now, could you please tell me about any medications you are currently taking, including any over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Not taking anything right now. Nothing at all. Just… trying to stay healthy, you know? Don't really like taking pills if I can avoid it.
DOCTOR: Alright, no current medications. Do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or environmental factors, such as pollen or animals?
PATIENT: Nope. No allergies. Never had one. I can eat anything, thankfully. And I don't have problems with pollen or anything like that. Lucky, I guess.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Now, Mr. Putney, to complete the insurance physical, I’d like to ask a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: No, never smoked a day in my life. Always thought it was a bad habit. And my wife… well, ex-wife… she hated it, too. So, definitely no.
DOCTOR: Okay, very good. And how about alcohol consumption?
PATIENT: Just a beer every now and then. Maybe on the weekends, watching the baseball game. Nothing heavy. Don't really drink much, honestly.
DOCTOR: Alright, occasional alcohol use. And finally, do you engage in any regular physical activity or exercise?
PATIENT: Not really "regular", no. I do some yard work, fixing things around the house. That's about it. Used to play basketball when I was younger, but my knees aren’t what they used to be. Mostly just… staying busy, I guess.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Putney, thank you for that information. Now, I'd like to perform a brief physical exam. This will include checking your vital signs – blood pressure, pulse, and temperature – as well as listening to your heart and lungs, and examining your abdomen. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, go ahead. Just… let’s try to make this quick, if you don’t mind. I got things to do.
DOCTOR: Certainly. Please have a seat, and I'll begin with your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is 142/90. That’s a bit elevated. We’ll want to monitor that. Heart sounds are regular, but I do detect a slight murmur. It’s not particularly concerning at this point, but worth noting. Lung sounds are clear. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, and there’s no evidence of any masses or organomegaly. Do you have any pain when I move your wrists around?
PATIENT: No, no pain at all. Like I said, the wrist healed up fine. Maybe a little stiff sometimes, but no pain. Just… feels a bit old, I guess.
DOCTOR: Alright, good to know. To get a more complete picture, I’d like to order a few basic lab tests – a complete blood count , a basic metabolic panel to check your kidney function and blood sugar, and a lipid panel to assess your cholesterol levels. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Ugh, blood tests. Fine, I guess. Whatever you need. Just… how long is this going to take? And where do I go to get them done? I don’t want to be running all over town.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Putney. The blood draw should only take a few minutes. We have a lab right here in the clinic, so you won’t need to go anywhere else. I’ll write the order now and a phlebotomist will be with you shortly. While we're waiting for the lab results, do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, not really. Just… will this affect my insurance? If you find something wrong, will they not cover me? That’s what I’m worried about.
DOCTOR: That’s a perfectly valid concern, Mr. Putney. The insurance company will receive the results of these tests, and they will make their own determination based on their underwriting guidelines. I’m not able to predict how they will respond, unfortunately. However, I can tell you that we'll discuss any abnormal findings with you in detail, and we can work together to develop a plan of care if needed. It's important to remember that even if we find something that requires attention, it doesn't necessarily mean you won't be covered. They may just adjust your premiums, or require a waiting period. The phlebotomist is here to draw your blood now. It will only take a few minutes. Let me know if you have any discomfort, and we'll be right here.
PATIENT: Alright. Let's just get this over with.
