DOCTOR: Good morning, Ellan. My name is Dr. Christopher Neppl. It’s a pleasure to meet you. I understand you’re here with us today. To start, could you tell me what brings you in?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is a pleasure, I suppose. Though I must say, I didn’t expect a… a young man. But never mind that. I’m here about getting one of those medical marijuana cards, if that's what you call them. My daughter, bless her heart, she says it's the only thing that will help my… discomfort. She handles all these modern things, you see. I wouldn’t even know where to begin.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ellan. We can certainly discuss medical marijuana as a potential treatment option. To ensure I understand your situation fully, and to determine if it may be appropriate for you, could you tell me more about this “discomfort” your daughter mentioned?
PATIENT: Well, it's my back, mostly. Always has been, really. A sharp pain, shooting down my leg sometimes. It flares up with the weather, you know? Damp days are the worst. And lifting… forget about lifting anything heavier than a teacup! My husband, Harold, he tries to help, but… well, men don’t understand these things. It's just… getting old, I suppose. Though I do try to stay active. A little gardening, a bit of walking when it doesn’t rain. But it's a constant… annoyance. It keeps me up at night, too. That's the worst part.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like you've been dealing with this back pain for quite some time, and that it's significantly impacting your quality of life – especially your sleep. To get a clearer picture, could you describe the pain in more detail?
PATIENT: Oh, detail. Yes. Well, it's not a constant ache, you understand. It comes and goes. When it is there, it's… a burning, really. Like someone is sticking pins in my lower back. And sometimes, that burning travels all the way down my left leg, right to my foot. Harold calls it sciatica, I think. He reads a lot of those… internet articles. It makes me feel very weak when it flares up. And stiff. Terribly stiff. I have to take a hot bath just to move. And even then it takes a good hour to feel… presentable. Is that detail enough? I don't usually go in for describing things, if I'm honest. It all feels a bit… undignified.
DOCTOR: That's very helpful, Ellan, thank you. The description is excellent, actually. It certainly sounds like it could be sciatica, as your husband suggested – irritation of the sciatic nerve. To clarify, does anything specific trigger these flare-ups, besides damp weather?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Definitely. Bending over, of course. Don't even think about reaching for something on the floor. And sitting for too long. Harold and I, we enjoy watching those old movies – the musicals, mostly. But after about thirty minutes, I have to get up and walk around. It's dreadful, really. Ruins a perfectly good film. And twisting… absolutely no twisting. I can't even help Harold with the gardening anymore, putting the plants in the pots. He says he understands, but he does give me looks. As if I'm being lazy. Men. And… I suppose carrying things, even light things, can set it off sometimes. It's just… being active is the problem, you see. Which is rather ironic, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: Yes, that is rather frustrating, Ellan. It sounds like many everyday activities exacerbate the pain. Now, you mentioned difficulty sleeping. Could you tell me more about that?
PATIENT: Well, it’s not that I can't fall asleep, necessarily. It's… staying asleep. I wake up several times during the night. Usually because of the pain, shooting down my leg again. And sometimes just… discomfort. A general ache. I toss and turn, trying to get comfortable, but it's no use. Harold snores, of course. A dreadful habit he refuses to address. So there's that. I end up lying awake for hours, just… staring at the ceiling. It’s exhausting, really. And then, of course, I'm tired all day. And the tiredness makes the pain worse, I think. It’s a vicious cycle, really. I've tried warm milk, you know. And those herbal teas. But nothing seems to help.
DOCTOR: I understand. That sounds incredibly disruptive to your rest and overall well-being. Frequent awakenings due to pain create a difficult cycle, as you described. Before we discuss medical marijuana specifically, I'd like to ask about other potential symptoms or medical conditions. Have you experienced any numbness or tingling in your legs or feet?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Sometimes. Not all the time, mind you. But occasionally, my left foot feels… sort of numb. Like it’s wrapped in cotton wool. And sometimes a tingling sensation, up my leg. It usually happens when the pain is particularly bad, you see. It's not constant, thankfully. But it's… unsettling. It makes me feel unsteady, you know? Like I might fall. I have to hold onto Harold when we’re walking. He complains, naturally. Says I’m being overly cautious. But I can't help it. It's just… a strange feeling. Almost like my foot isn't really there. And sometimes, my hands get a little shaky. But I put that down to getting old, mostly. It's probably just nerves.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ellan. That information is helpful. To get a more complete picture of your medical history, could you tell me about any other health conditions you have?
PATIENT: Well, I have a touch of high blood pressure, the doctor told me years ago. I take a small pill for it every morning. Nothing drastic, you understand. And my cholesterol is a little high, but I watch my diet, mostly. I don't eat a lot of red meat, you see. And I try to avoid sugary things. Harold, he spoils me with sweets, but I try to limit myself. Other than that… oh, I had a hysterectomy many years ago. A long story, that. Nothing to worry about now, of course. It was… a long time ago. And my knees bother me sometimes, especially in cold weather. But that's just… getting old, isn’t it? I don’t really have any serious illnesses, if that’s what you’re asking. Just… the usual aches and pains of a woman my age.
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful, Ellan. It sounds like your hypertension is well-controlled. Are you currently taking any medications besides the blood pressure pill?
PATIENT: No, just the one. And the occasional ibuprofen when my knees act up, but that’s not every day, you understand. Just when they’re particularly bothersome. And sometimes a little something for my digestion. Harold makes the most delicious food, but it does tend to… disagree with me sometimes. Just a little something over the counter, nothing serious. I don’t like taking a lot of pills, if I’m honest. They make me feel… sluggish. And I’m perfectly capable of managing on my own, most of the time. I don’t want to become reliant on anything, you see.
DOCTOR: I understand your preference to avoid unnecessary medications. Now, could you tell me about any allergies you may have?
PATIENT: Oh, allergies. Hmm. Let me think. Well, I have a slight reaction to bee stings. Not a severe one, thankfully. Just a little swelling and itching. I carry an EpiPen, just in case, but I haven't needed to use it in years. And sometimes my skin gets a little itchy when I use certain soaps. Nothing major, though. I just switch to a different brand. Other than that… I don't really have any serious allergies, if that's what you're asking. I eat all sorts of things, you see. I enjoy my food. And I haven't noticed any particularly bad reactions to anything lately. I'm a fairly robust woman, you understand. Not easily bothered by things.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Ellan. Now, could you tell me a little bit about your family medical history?
PATIENT: Oh, family history. That’s a bit… complicated. My mother, bless her soul, she had arthritis. Badly. She was bedridden for the last few years of her life. It was dreadful to watch. And my father, he had heart problems. A weak heart, the doctor said. He died quite suddenly, you see. And my brother, he had diabetes. He wasn’t very careful with his diet, you see. He loved sweets. Other than that… not much. No one in my family had anything particularly serious, if that's what you're asking. Mostly just… the usual aches and pains of getting old. It seems to run in the family, you see. And I suppose I’m just… predisposed to it. It’s probably just my fate, you understand.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ellan. That gives me a better understanding. Finally, could you tell me a little about your lifestyle – do you smoke, drink alcohol, or engage in any regular exercise?
PATIENT: Oh, lifestyle. Well, I certainly don't smoke. Never have. Disgusting habit, in my opinion. And I don't drink alcohol very often. Perhaps a small glass of wine with dinner on special occasions. But nothing excessive, you understand. Harold enjoys a beer now and then, but I prefer a cup of tea. As for exercise… well, I try to stay active. I enjoy gardening, as I mentioned. And I go for a little walk when the weather is nice. But I'm not one for strenuous activity, you understand. I'm a woman of a certain age, you see. And I have to be careful not to overexert myself. I don’t want to make my back worse. So, I wouldn't say I have a particularly active lifestyle, but I do try to stay mobile. It's important, you see. Keeps the joints from getting too stiff. And the mind from getting too… dull.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ellan. That was very helpful. Now, I understand you’re interested in exploring medical marijuana as a potential treatment option for your discomfort. Before we proceed, I'd like to conduct a brief physical exam to assess your range of motion, reflexes, and overall neurological function. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. Though I must say, I’m not very fond of doctors poking and prodding. But if it’s necessary… then so be it. I’ll try to be as cooperative as possible. Though I do hope it won’t be too… uncomfortable. And please be gentle, Doctor. My back is rather sensitive, you see. Perhaps you could explain what you’re doing as you go along? It always makes me feel better when I know what’s happening.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ellan. I will explain everything as I go along, and I will be as gentle as possible. We’ll start with your back. Could you please lie down on your side, facing up?
PATIENT: Oh dear. This is a bit… awkward. Harold always helps me with things like this. But… alright. I’m on my side, Doctor. Facing up, as you requested. Please be careful. And do let me know if you need me to adjust my position. I’m not as flexible as I used to be, you see. And don’t be surprised if I let out a little groan. It’s just… the pain, you understand. It tends to flare up when I move.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ellan. I’m just going to gently feel along your spine and the muscles around it. I'm checking for any areas of tenderness or muscle spasms. Let me know if anything feels particularly painful. Does this feel tender?
PATIENT: Ooh! Yes, right there! That’s… that’s the spot. It always hurts when someone touches it. It’s a sharp, stabbing pain, you see? Almost like a… a burning sensation. Not a constant pain, mind you, but definitely tender. And if you press a little harder… …Oh dear. That’s quite uncomfortable. Please be gentle, Doctor. Really. It's a very sensitive area. And if you don't mind, perhaps we could move on? I'm not sure I can tolerate much more poking and prodding.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ellan. I apologize for any discomfort. I’ll be much more gentle. Now, I’m going to check your range of motion. Could you gently bend forward, reaching towards your toes?
PATIENT: Ooh! Oh dear. I… I can't go much further, Doctor. It's too painful. It feels like something is… pulling in my back. And my legs are starting to feel a little shaky. Perhaps this isn't a good idea. I'm not very flexible, you see. And bending over always makes things worse. Really. I think I’d prefer if we skipped this part. It’s just… agonizing. Please don’t make me push myself. I’m afraid I’ll pull something.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ellan. We will absolutely stop there. No need to push yourself. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes. Could you bend your knees and relax your legs while I gently tap a small hammer on your patellar tendon?
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. I’m ready. Though I must say, I’m not very fond of hammers. They always remind me of… unpleasant things. Please be gentle. And if it’s too painful, please just stop. I’m afraid I’m not very resilient, you see. And my legs have been feeling a little… unsteady lately. It’s probably just… old age. But I don’t want to risk falling or anything. Please be careful.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let me just check this… Good, that reflex appears normal. Now the other leg. And this one is a little slower, a bit diminished. That’s not necessarily cause for alarm at your age, but something we’ll note. Now, let’s check your sensation. Can you tell me if you feel this when I lightly touch you here?
PATIENT: Yes… yes, I can feel that. It’s… a little prickly, you see? Not unpleasant, but definitely there. And a little… tingly. Is that normal, Doctor? I sometimes get a tingling sensation in my legs, you see. It's not constant, mind you, but it's definitely there sometimes. And it's a little… disconcerting. Is something wrong? Perhaps it’s my circulation? I do get cold feet rather easily, you see. Especially in the winter. And sometimes my legs feel a little… numb. Is that a cause for concern? Please tell me everything, Doctor. I don't want any surprises.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ellan. The diminished reflex and altered sensation in your left leg are something we need to consider. It’s not immediately alarming, and it could be related to your nerve compression, but it's something we want to investigate further. Now, to summarize, you’re experiencing lower back pain radiating down your left leg, accompanied by occasional numbness and tingling, and a slightly diminished reflex and altered sensation in that leg. Does that accurately reflect your experience?
PATIENT: Yes… yes, that’s… that’s pretty much it. The radiating pain, the numbness, the tingling… and the… the weakness, you see? Sometimes I just feel… unsteady on my feet. And my back… it’s always aching, you know? And the hot baths… they help, for a little while, but it always comes back. And the sleepless nights… oh, the sleepless nights. It’s just… a constant struggle, Doctor. It’s wearing me down, you see? And I just want to be able to… live my life, you know? To be able to garden without pain, to be able to sleep through the night… is that too much to ask? So… what do you think, Doctor? Is medical marijuana something that might help? I’m willing to try anything, at this point.
DOCTOR: Ellan, based on your presentation, medical marijuana could be a potential option to help manage your pain and improve your quality of life. It may help alleviate the radiating pain, reduce muscle spasms, and improve sleep. However, it's important to understand that it’s not a cure-all, and it has potential side effects. Before we proceed, I recommend an MRI of your lower back to get a clearer picture of the source of your pain and rule out any serious underlying conditions. Would you be open to that?
PATIENT: An MRI… Oh dear. Is that… painful, Doctor? I’ve heard those machines are very loud and… claustrophobic. I’m not very fond of confined spaces, you see. And I do get a little anxious easily. But… if it’s necessary to get to the bottom of this… then I suppose I’m willing to try. But please, Doctor, tell me everything. What will it involve? Will I be in a lot of discomfort? And how long will it take? I don’t want any surprises, you see. I just want to be prepared. And… what if it shows something… serious? I’m afraid I’m not very resilient, you see.
DOCTOR: Ellan, I understand your concerns. An MRI is not painful, but it does involve lying still inside a large, enclosed tube. It can be loud, so we'll provide you with earplugs. As for the duration, it typically takes around 30-60 minutes. We'll make sure you’re comfortable and monitored throughout the procedure. Regarding the possibility of finding something serious, it's important to be prepared for all outcomes. If we find a structural issue, we'll discuss your options, which may include physical therapy, injections, or, in rare cases, surgery. However, it's also possible that the MRI will simply confirm nerve compression, which can be managed with conservative treatments, including medical marijuana. Before we schedule the MRI, do you have any metal implants, such as a pacemaker or surgical clips?
PATIENT: Metal implants… Hmm. Let me see. No, I don’t think so. I had a hysterectomy many years ago, but the doctor didn't mention anything about metal implants. And I’ve never had any surgeries on my back. I do have a few fillings, of course, but I don’t think those will be a problem. And… oh, I used to have a lot of braces when I was a child. But those were removed many years ago. I don’t think there’s anything else. But… Harold had a hip replacement a few years ago. Does that matter? Perhaps I should ask him, just to be sure. He’s very good with remembering these things, you see. He’s always so… meticulous.
DOCTOR: That’s a good idea to double-check with Harold, Ellan. It’s important to rule out any contraindications for the MRI. Also, just to be safe, do you know if your fillings contain mercury?
PATIENT: Mercury… Oh dear. I have no idea, Doctor. I’ve never asked. It was so long ago, you see. I just went to the dentist, and they filled the cavities. I don't remember any specific conversations about mercury. It’s probably best to ask Harold, he always keeps the dental records. He's very careful with these things, you see. Always thinking ahead. He'd know if my fillings contain mercury. He'd know everything. He's a very… practical man. I'll ask him when he gets home. He should be back any minute now.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ellan. Let's focus on confirming the filling composition and any potential metal implants with Harold. Once we have that information, we can proceed with scheduling the MRI. In the meantime, I will prepare a referral for the MRI and a list of resources about medical marijuana in case you're interested. Once we have the MRI results, we'll discuss your options and create a treatment plan tailored to your needs. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… alright. It’s a lot to take in, you see. But I appreciate your patience and… thoroughness. It’s comforting to know that you’re taking everything seriously. And I’m grateful for the resources about medical marijuana. I’m willing to try anything, at this point, to get some relief. And I’m glad you’re recommending an MRI. It’s important to get to the bottom of this, you see. So… yes. Let’s focus on getting the information from Harold. He should be home any minute now. And then… we can proceed. Thank you, Doctor. Thank you very much.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ellan. I’m here to help in any way I can. Take your time, and please don’t hesitate to contact my office if you have any questions or concerns. I'll have the staff prepare the referral and information packet. We'll look forward to hearing from you soon.
