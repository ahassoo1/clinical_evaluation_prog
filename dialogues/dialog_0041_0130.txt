DOCTOR: Hello, Mr. Schwer. Good to meet you. I’m Dr. Polczynski. Thanks for coming in today. So, what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Hi Doctor. Good to meet you too. Well, it’s my family, you see. Lots of… problems. My mother, she had… something with her heart. And my brother, he… well, he had trouble with his thinking. I just want to make sure I am okay, you know? I don’t want the same thing to happen to me.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's very smart of you to be proactive, especially with a family history of health issues. It’s good you’re thinking about this now. Let’s talk a bit more about what your mother and brother experienced, if you’re comfortable sharing. Any details you remember, even if they seem small, could be helpful. Do you know what specifically was wrong with your mother's heart, or what kind of trouble your brother was having with his thinking?
PATIENT: Well… my mother, she was always tired. Very tired. And then she got… puffy. Like, her legs swelled up. She went to the hospital a lot, and they said something about… her heart not being strong enough. I don't know the name of it. It was a long time ago. And my brother… he started forgetting things. Simple things. Where he put his keys, what day it was. He got… angry sometimes, too. He had to go to a special place… a home. It was sad.
DOCTOR: Okay, that gives me a little more to work with. It sounds like your mother had symptoms of heart failure, and your brother had some cognitive changes. Do you remember roughly when your mother was diagnosed, or how old she was?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. She got sick when I was maybe… thirty? No, younger. Twenty-five, maybe? It was before I had kids. So a long time ago. And my brother… he got worse slowly. It took maybe five years from when we first noticed something to when he needed to go to the home. He was… sixty-ish, I think. Maybe sixty-two when he went in.
DOCTOR: Alright, thank you. That’s helpful. Besides the tiredness and swelling with your mother, did she have any trouble breathing, or chest pain?
PATIENT: Hmm… now that you mention it, yes. She did have trouble catching her breath sometimes. Especially when she walked. She’d have to stop and rest a lot. And… I think she complained about her chest hurting a few times, but she didn’t go to the doctor for it. She didn’t like doctors much.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's important information. And with your brother, besides forgetting things and getting angry, did he have any difficulty with speaking, or understanding what people said?
PATIENT: Now that you ask… yes. Towards the end, he didn’t always understand what I was saying. I’d have to repeat myself a lot. And sometimes, he’d… struggle to find the right words. It was hard to watch. He got very frustrated.
DOCTOR: Okay. Thank you for sharing that. It sounds like both your mother and brother had significant health challenges. Now, let's talk a little about you. Have you been experiencing any similar symptoms – tiredness, shortness of breath, swelling in your legs, memory problems, difficulty with speech, or anything else that concerns you?
PATIENT: Well… I get tired, yes. But I’m seventy-three! I think everyone gets tired at seventy-three. And sometimes my legs feel a little puffy at the end of the day, but I figured that’s just from being on my feet all day at work. I sell things, you see. Lots of walking. I haven't forgotten anything… not yet, anyway. I think.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. It's perfectly normal to experience some fatigue and mild swelling with age and activity. However, it's always best to check things out, especially with your family history. To get a better picture, I’d like to do a brief physical exam. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your legs. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. I guess it can’t hurt. I always worry, you know? It’s just… seeing my mother and brother… I want to be sure I’m okay.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. That’s a very sensible approach, and that’s exactly why you’re here. Let’s get started. Could you please sit up on the examination table for me?
PATIENT: Alright. Here I am. Be gentle, Doctor. My old bones aren't what they used to be.
DOCTOR: Of course. I will be very gentle. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs with my stethoscope. Please breathe normally. Your heart rate is a little fast, but not excessively so. I hear some mild crackles in the base of your lungs, which could be due to a number of things. Now, I’m going to check your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is slightly elevated. Finally, I’ll take a quick look at your legs. Could you please point your toes upwards for me?
PATIENT: Alright. They feel… a little swollen, I suppose. But like I said, I'm on my feet all day. Is everything okay, Doctor? You seem to be thinking hard.
DOCTOR: Everything appears okay, Mr. Schwer, but there are a few things I'd like to investigate further, given your family history and these initial findings. The mild crackles in your lungs and the slightly elevated blood pressure, combined with the leg swelling, could indicate early signs of heart failure or fluid retention. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order a few simple tests: a complete blood count, a basic metabolic panel to check your kidney function, and an EKG to assess your heart’s electrical activity. I also recommend a chest X-ray to get a better look at your lungs. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Tests… alright. I don’t like tests, but… if it will tell me if I’m okay, yes. That sounds… sensible. What will these tests show, exactly? And will they be painful?
DOCTOR: That's a very good question. The complete blood count will give us information about your overall health and rule out any underlying infections. The basic metabolic panel will check your kidney function, as your kidneys play a vital role in fluid balance. And the EKG will assess your heart's rhythm and identify any potential abnormalities. The tests themselves are not painful at all. The blood draw might sting for a moment, but it's very quick. The EKG involves placing small stickers on your chest, arms, and legs – it doesn’t hurt, and it only takes a few minutes. The chest X-ray is also painless – you’ll simply stand in front of a machine while it takes a picture. These tests will help us determine if your heart and lungs are functioning properly and whether any further investigation is needed. We can schedule them for tomorrow morning at the clinic. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Tomorrow… yes, that sounds alright. As long as it doesn’t take all day. I have things to do, you see. Selling things… people expect me. So, tomorrow morning. And you’ll tell me the results, right? You won’t just leave me wondering?
DOCTOR: Absolutely. We’ll schedule you for first thing tomorrow morning. It shouldn’t take more than an hour or so. And of course, I will personally review the results with you as soon as they come in. I won’t leave you wondering, I promise. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms – such as increased shortness of breath, chest pain, or significant swelling in your legs – please don't hesitate to call the clinic immediately. Do you have any questions for me right now, Mr. Schwer?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s everything. Just… thank you, Doctor. For listening. And for not laughing at an old man worrying about his family.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Schwer. It's my job to listen and help you stay healthy. And please, don’t ever feel embarrassed to ask questions or express your concerns. It’s a sign of strength, not weakness. We’ll see you tomorrow morning then. Have a good rest of your day, and please, don’t hesitate to call if anything changes. .
PATIENT: Okay. You too, Doctor. Goodbye.
