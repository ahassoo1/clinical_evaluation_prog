DOCTOR: Hi Kahrin, welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Maskal. It’s lovely to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Right, um, hi Doctor. Just the results, really. I got the email saying they were back and I wanted to go over them. I don't have a lot of time, if that's okay.
DOCTOR: Of course, completely understand. We can definitely focus on the results. I see here you had some blood work done on July 26th. Is that correct?
PATIENT: Yep, that's right. July 26th. I remember, it was a Friday. Is everything… okay? I mean, that's why I'm here, right? To find out if everything is okay.
DOCTOR: Yes, of course. Let’s take a look together. Overall, most of your results are within the normal range, which is good. Your complete blood count looks excellent – that's your red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. Your basic metabolic panel is also pretty good; kidney function and electrolytes are all within normal limits. However, there are a couple of things I’d like to discuss. Your Vitamin D level is a bit low, and your thyroid stimulating hormone, or TSH, is slightly elevated. Do you know what those are, or would you like me to explain them a bit?
PATIENT: TSH… vaguely? I think I read something about thyroid stuff once, but I don’t really… remember what it means. And Vitamin D, yeah, I spend a lot of time inside. But is the thyroid thing… bad? Please don't use a lot of medical words.
DOCTOR: No problem at all – I’ll keep it simple. Your thyroid is a little gland in your neck, and it makes a hormone that controls how your body uses energy. TSH is a hormone that tells your thyroid to make more of that energy hormone. When your TSH is a little high, it usually means your thyroid isn't making enough of the energy hormone. It's often not a big deal, but we want to investigate it a little further to make sure everything is working as it should. Does that make sense so far?
PATIENT: Yeah, that… kinda makes sense. So my thyroid is being lazy? Is that what you're saying? And what does "investigate" mean? More tests? Because honestly, Doctor, I really don't have time for a lot of appointments. I'm trying to get this done and get back to work.
DOCTOR: That’s a good way to put it – it's a little bit like your thyroid is taking a bit of a break. And yes, "investigate" means we'd do a little more testing to understand why your TSH is elevated. The simplest thing to do would be to repeat the TSH test in about six to eight weeks to see if the level has changed on its own. Sometimes it fluctuates. If it's still high then, we can talk about other tests – possibly an antibody test to see if it's an autoimmune issue, or an ultrasound to look at the thyroid gland itself. Would that work for you?
PATIENT: Six to eight weeks... ugh. Okay, fine. But can I just, like, schedule that now so I don't have to think about it? And is there anything I can do in the meantime? Like, eat something special or… I don’t know, take a vitamin? Anything to maybe help it get better on its own? About the Vitamin D, should I be taking something for that too? I really appreciate you keeping it simple, by the way. It's… helpful.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. We can get that repeat TSH test scheduled right now. Let me see… how about August 29th?
PATIENT: August 29th works. Okay, good. And about the vitamins? Anything? I'm not really big on taking a bunch of pills if I don't have to. Honestly, I just want to get this sorted and move on.
DOCTOR: Okay, August 29th is booked for you. As for vitamins, yes, for your low Vitamin D, I would recommend a supplement. A daily dose of 2000 IU of Vitamin D3 is a good starting point. It's generally very safe, and it can definitely help boost your levels, especially since you spend a lot of time indoors. As for the thyroid, there’s not really anything specific you need to do diet-wise at this point – we're just gathering information. We’ll have a better idea of what to do after the repeat test. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Okay, Vitamin D… 2000 IU. Got it. And nothing else. That’s… manageable. Is there anything else I need to know before August 29th? Any symptoms I should be looking out for? I’m just trying to be prepared. I really appreciate you not making me come back a million times.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome. I understand wanting to minimize appointments. For the slightly elevated TSH, the symptoms of an underactive thyroid can be quite vague – fatigue, weight gain, feeling cold, dry skin, constipation. But a lot of things can cause those symptoms, so don't panic if you experience any of them. If you start feeling significantly more tired, or notice a big change in your weight, then definitely give us a call before August 29th. Otherwise, we’ll just see what the repeat test shows. Do you have any questions for me before we finish up?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s… everything. Honestly, you’ve been really helpful. Just… Vitamin D, watch for weird symptoms, and come back August 29th. Got it. Thank you, Doctor.
