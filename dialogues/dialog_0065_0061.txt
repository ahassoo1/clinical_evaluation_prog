DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Murph. I'm Dr. Duplichan. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Uh... well, my son, he signed me up for... somethin'. A tryout. For... sports. I forget what kinda sports, exactly. Old age, you know? Makes the brain a little fuzzy. He said I needed a check-up first, to make sure I ain't gonna fall over on 'em. Something like that.
DOCTOR: A tryout, you say. And your son felt a medical evaluation was prudent beforehand. Right. Well, it's certainly responsible of him. To get a good baseline, let's start with a little bit more detail about why he thought a tryout was a good idea now, at your age. And what kind of activities do you think it might involve?
PATIENT: Oh, he's a good boy. Always lookin' out for me. He said... somethin' about a team. A local team, I think. And... well, I used to play a little baseball when I was younger. Not much, but... I used to throw a ball pretty good. He kept talkin’ about that. And... maybe some runnin’? I don’t remember exactly. It was a surprise, see. He just... signed me up. He said it would be fun. But my knees... they ain’t what they used to be, Doctor. That’s for sure.
DOCTOR: A local team, baseball…and your knees are a concern. Alright. Let's get a more complete picture. Before we focus on the knees, let's go back a bit. Do you have any other medical problems?
PATIENT: Medical problems... hmm. Let me think. I got a little trouble sleepin' sometimes. Not every night, but... enough to bother me. And my back… it gets stiff now and then. Especially if I bend over too much. Oh! And the doctor told me a few years ago my blood pressure was a little high. I think he gave me some pills for it. I take 'em most days, I think. But... honestly, Doctor, I forget a lot these days. I got a little bottle, but... is that for the pressure? I can’t always remember.
DOCTOR: Alright. Sleep trouble, back stiffness, and a history of high blood pressure. And some difficulty remembering if you're taking the medication for it. Do you happen to know the name of the medication?
PATIENT: Name of the... pill? Oh, geez. That's a tough one. It's... little white one, I think. Or maybe a little yellow one? Small one, you swallow it with water. It came in a orange bottle. No... maybe it was a blue bottle? My wife, she keeps track of those things. I just take what she gives me. I really don’t pay attention to the names. Sorry, Doctor. I wish I could be more help.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Mr. Murph. We can sort through this. It sounds like we need to review your medication list. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies... hmm. Let me think real hard. I don't think so. Never had a bad reaction to nothin', as far as I remember. Maybe a little itchy sometimes if I get bit by a mosquito. But that's just a bug bite, right? Not an allergy. I don't avoid any foods, either. I eat pretty much everything. My wife makes good cookin', and I don't like to waste nothin'. No, I don't think I got any allergies, Doctor. I really don't.
DOCTOR: No known allergies. Good. Now, have you had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything in the past?
PATIENT: Surgeries... hmm. That's another tough one. Let me see... I think I had my tonsils out when I was a little boy. A long, long time ago. And... oh! When I broke my arm playin' baseball, I had to go to the hospital for a cast. But that was a long time ago too. Aside from that... I don't think so. Not that I remember, anyway. I haven’t been sick enough to go to the hospital in a long, long time. I try to stay healthy. Mostly.
DOCTOR: Alright. Tonsillectomy as a child, broken arm, cast. No other surgeries or hospitalizations. Let's talk about your family. Is there anyone in your family with a history of heart disease, diabetes, cancer, or any other major medical problems?
PATIENT: Oh, my family... hmm. My father, he had a bad heart, I think. He had chest pains a lot when he got older. And my mother, she had trouble with her sugar, I think that was diabetes. She got real tired all the time. And... my sister, she got sick a long time ago. Cancer, I think. It was a long time ago, and I don’t remember much about it. It was very sad. But... aside from that... everyone else was pretty healthy, I think. Mostly. It’s hard to remember, you know? It was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Alright. Father with heart problems, mother with diabetes, sister with cancer. That’s helpful information. Now, do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, no, no. Not me. Never smoked a cigarette in my life. My wife, she used to smoke a little when we were younger, but she quit a long time ago. And... I don't drink much alcohol, either. Maybe a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, on special occasions. And… definitely no… recreational drugs. Never touched 'em. I'm a pretty simple man, Doctor. I like my coffee in the morning and a good night's sleep. That's about it.
DOCTOR: Alright. No smoking, minimal alcohol, no recreational drugs. Now, before we do a physical exam, can you tell me what a typical day looks like for you?
PATIENT: A typical day... hmm. Well, I wake up around 7, usually. My wife makes me coffee and toast. I read the newspaper, mostly. Then I might do a little work in the garden. I got some tomatoes growin', and some peppers. I like to keep busy. In the afternoon, I usually take a nap. My knees get tired, you know? Then my wife and I eat dinner around 6. We watch a little TV after that. And then I go to bed around 10. Pretty simple, like I said. Nothing too exciting. Mostly just tryin' to stay comfortable. That’s about it. Oh, and sometimes my son comes over and visits. That's always nice.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Murph. That gives me a good overview. Now, let's do a quick physical exam. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your knees. Do you mind if I take your pulse and temperature as well?
PATIENT: No, no, that’s fine. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. Just be gentle with my knees, okay? They get a little achy sometimes. And... I don't like needles. Just lettin' you know. But... I trust you. Do whatever you need to do. I just wanna make sure I don't fall over on my son. He's a good boy. He just wants me to have fun.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Murph. I’ll be as gentle as possible. And we’ll take things slowly. No sudden movements. We’ll start with your blood pressure. Blood pressure is 148 over 86. A little elevated, but not drastically so. Pulse is 72 and regular. Now, let's listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are normal, no murmurs. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Now, about those knees… Can you stand up for me, please?
PATIENT: Okay, okay. Standin' up… There we go. A little shaky, but standin'. Oh, these knees… Go easy on me, Doctor. I ain't as young as I used to be. What are you lookin' for? Do I need to bend 'em or somethin'? I'm afraid I might fall.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Murph. Just stand normally for now. I’m looking for any swelling or tenderness. There is some crepitus with range of motion, and mild tenderness to palpation along the medial joint line of both knees. No significant swelling. Range of motion is slightly limited, particularly with flexion. Do you experience any locking, clicking, or giving way with your knees?
PATIENT: Locking, clicking… Hmm… sometimes I feel a little pop when I bend 'em real low. Like a little snap. Is that a click? I don’t know. It doesn’t hurt, usually. And… no, no givin’ way. They just kinda… ache. Especially after I’ve been walkin’ for a while. Or after I’ve been sittin’ for too long. Then they get stiff. It’s just old age, I guess. This happens every time. It ain’t as bad as it used to be, though. Used to be much worse.
DOCTOR: Alright. Crepitus, mild tenderness, limited range of motion, and a sensation of popping. Now, can you try walking a few steps for me?
PATIENT: Okay, okay. Walkin’… One… two… three… four… It’s kinda hard, Doctor. I don’t like puttin’ too much weight on ‘em. They feel a little wobbly. And… they kinda ache when I bend ‘em. Just let me know when you want me to stop. I don’t wanna fall over on your nice floor.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Murph. That's enough walking for now. Please, have a seat. Based on what you've told me, and the physical exam, it seems you have osteoarthritis in both knees. It's a common condition, especially with age and previous activity. The popping sensation is likely crepitus, and the aching and stiffness are typical symptoms. We’ll need some X-rays to confirm the diagnosis and assess the severity.
PATIENT: X-rays? Oh… X-rays… are those… safe? I don’t like radiation. My wife, she always worries about radiation. Is it gonna hurt? I ain’t had X-rays in years. And… what does arthritis mean, exactly? Is that… serious? I just wanna be able to walk without achin’ all the time. And… not fall over on my son. He’s countin’ on me.
DOCTOR: It’s understandable to be concerned about radiation, Mr. Murph. The amount of radiation from X-rays is very low, and the benefits of getting a clear diagnosis far outweigh the risks. It’s a quick and painless procedure. As for arthritis, it means the cartilage in your knees has worn down, causing the bones to rub together. It’s not immediately life-threatening, but it can cause pain, stiffness, and limited mobility. We can manage the symptoms with several options, including physical therapy, medication, and injections. We'll start with the X-rays to see how severe it is, then we can discuss the best course of treatment for you. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Okay… okay. Physical therapy… medication… injections… It sounds… complicated. I don’t like needles, you know. And I ain’t very good at… exercisin’. My knees get tired real easy. But… if it helps me walk without achin’ and not fall over, I guess I can try. So… X-rays first, right? Where do we do those? And… how long does it take? I got a doctor’s appointment next week, too. I don’t wanna miss that. And… will I be able to drive myself home after? I don’t wanna bother my son. He’s busy.
DOCTOR: Yes, X-rays first. It’s a quick procedure, usually takes about 10-15 minutes. We have the X-ray technician right down the hall. They will position your knees and take a few images. You shouldn’t feel any pain or discomfort. You will be able to drive yourself home afterward, yes. There are no restrictions. We’ll get the results back tomorrow, and I’ll review them with you. I’ll also give you a referral for physical therapy. We can discuss medication options at your next appointment. And I’ll make a note to factor in your existing appointment next week when scheduling our follow-up. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Okay… okay. That sounds… manageable. X-rays, then physical therapy, then… maybe medication. And you’ll fit it around my other appointment. That’s good. Okay. Let’s get the X-rays done, then. Where do I go? And… is it cold in there? My knees get cold real easy, too. I shoulda worn my long pants. But… it’s August. I guess. Just… point me in the right direction, Doctor. I trust you. Just wanna be able to walk without achin’. And not fall over on my son. That’s all.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Murph. Just down the hall, first door on the right. The technician, Maria, will be expecting you. And yes, it can be a little cool in there, so I’ll ask her to make sure you’re comfortable. I'll have Maria get you a blanket. She’ll explain everything to you. Don't hesitate to ask her any questions. And I’ll see you tomorrow to review the results. Here we go. Let's get those X-rays done. And don’t worry. We’ll take good care of you.
