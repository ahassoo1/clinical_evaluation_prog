DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Steines. Welcome to the clinic. I am Dr. Pipkorn. It says here you're ninety years young. That's wonderful. Now, can you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Ninety, yes. Feels like a hundred some days, ha. I’ve been feelin’ kinda… off. Mostly just tired and gettin’ headaches. The nurse took my blood pressure and said it was high. That’s why I’m here, I reckon.
DOCTOR: Alright. "Feeling off," tiredness, headaches, and elevated blood pressure… Yes, that certainly warrants a closer look. Can you tell me a bit more about these headaches, Ms. Steines?
PATIENT: Well, they ain’t the kinda headache that’ll knock you off your feet, ya know? More like a constant pressure, right around my forehead. Comes and goes. Been happenin’ more lately, I think. Hard to keep track, gettin' old. But they bother me when I’m bakin’, keeps me from concentratin’.
DOCTOR: I understand. A persistent pressure is… less dramatic than a severe headache, but certainly disruptive. And concentration is important, especially with baking. Have you noticed anything that specifically seems to trigger these headaches, or make them worse?
PATIENT: Hmm… not really. Seems random. Sometimes it's when it’s hot in the kitchen, but I always have a fan goin’. Sometimes it don’t matter what I’m doin’. I used to think it was the smell of the cinnamon, but I use that all the time. Truth be told, I don’t rightly know. It just happens.
DOCTOR: “Just happens”… Alright. And would you describe these headaches as constant, or do they come and go in bursts?
PATIENT: They come and go. Not all day, every day. Maybe a couple times a week? Sometimes not at all for a few days, then they'll bother me for a day or two. It’s hard to say for sure, like I said. Old age… messes with your memory.
DOCTOR: Yes, memory can be… unreliable. Let’s move on, then. Aside from the headaches and tiredness, have you experienced any other symptoms recently?
PATIENT: Well… now that you mention it… sometimes my eyesight gets kinda blurry. Not all the time, just… flashes. And my hands get shaky when I'm tryin' to roll out the dough. Thought it was just the age, though. But maybe it's somethin' else?
DOCTOR: Blurry vision and hand tremors… That is more than just “age,” as you say. When did you first notice these symptoms – the vision changes and the shaking?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think... The blurry vision started a few months back, I'd say. Maybe around spring? The shaky hands… a little longer, maybe six, seven months ago. It started small, just a little wobble, but it's gettin' worse. Makes it hard to make a good pie crust, I tell ya. It's embarrassing, really.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Steines. Let's do a quick physical examination. I’d like to check your neurological function, and listen to your heart and lungs. And I will check your blood pressure again, just to confirm the nurse’s reading. It’s standard procedure. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Sounds fine, Doctor. As long as it don’t take all day. I got a batch of apple pies needin’ to be made. But do what ya gotta do.
DOCTOR: Very well. If you would just sit up on the table for me. First, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take deep breaths in and out as I listen.
PATIENT: Alright. Used to be a nice doctor here. Knew my mama. Real kind fella.
DOCTOR: Your heart sounds… regular, but a slightly elevated rate. Lungs are clear, no wheezing or crackles. Now, let’s check your reflexes. I’m going to tap on your knees and elbows, and you just relax your legs and arms.
PATIENT: Okay. Relax… easier said than done when you're ninety years old. Go ahead, Doctor. I reckon I've had enough tappin' in my life.
DOCTOR: Diminished, but equal on both sides. Now, I’d like to check your cranial nerves. Can you follow my finger with your eyes without moving your head?
PATIENT: Sure. There. Am I followin’ it alright? It’s kinda hard to see clearly sometimes.
DOCTOR: Slight nystagmus noted, and some tracking difficulty… Okay. Now, can you smile for me?
PATIENT: There. Is that alright? My face gets kinda… stiff these days. Not as easy as it used to be.
DOCTOR: Slight facial droop noted on the left side. Alright, Ms. Steines. I'm going to order some blood work, including a complete metabolic panel, CBC, and thyroid function tests. I'd also like to order a CT scan of your brain, just to rule out any structural issues. It's standard procedure given your symptoms – headaches, blurry vision, tremors, and the mild facial weakness.
PATIENT: A CT scan? Goodness. Sounds… serious. What are ya lookin’ for, Doctor? Is it somethin’ bad? I just wanna know if I can still make pies.
DOCTOR: It’s not necessarily serious, Ms. Steines. A CT scan simply gives us a more detailed picture of what’s going on in your brain. We're looking for anything that might be causing your symptoms - a stroke, a tumor, or even just age-related changes. It's better to be thorough, given your history. And to be clear, a CT scan does not automatically mean you can't make pies. We need the information first to determine the cause of your symptoms, and then we can discuss appropriate treatment options. I will also refer you to a neurologist for a complete evaluation.
PATIENT: A neurologist, too? That’s… a lot of doctors. And a scan. Seems like a whole ordeal just to find out why I got a headache. Well… if you think it’s necessary. I reckon I trust your judgment, Doctor. But please… tell me straight if it’s somethin’ bad. I don't need sugar-coating at my age. And… can I still bake? That’s all I really care about.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Steines. I will be forthright with you. We need to rule out any serious underlying conditions, and these tests are essential for that. As for baking… until we have the results, I cannot definitively say whether it is safe for you to continue. We need to determine the cause of your symptoms first. However, I do not believe these symptoms are immediately life-threatening. I will write you a referral to Dr. Anya Sharma, a neurologist downtown. Her office will contact you to schedule an appointment. The lab results should be available within 24-48 hours, and the CT scan results typically take a bit longer. In the meantime, I advise you to avoid any strenuous activity, and please let someone know if your symptoms worsen. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No… I don’t think so. Just… try to be quick about it, alright? I got a pie shop to run. Thank you, Doctor. I guess. .
DOCTOR: Very well. The nurse will be with you shortly to review the instructions and schedule follow-up appointments. I will review the results as soon as they are available. Have a good day, Ms. Steines. .
