DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Tomassoni. I’m Dr. Duplichan. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s a bit hard to explain precisely. I’ve noticed some swelling, and it’s been… concerning me, I suppose. I don’t entirely recall when it started, truthfully. It feels like it’s been a little while, though.
DOCTOR: “A little while” isn’t terribly specific, Mr. Tomassoni. Can you give me a timeframe?
PATIENT: You’re right, apologies. It’s…difficult to pinpoint. Perhaps… a few weeks? Maybe a month? It hasn't been that long, I don't believe. It’s just…my memory isn’t what it used to be, Doctor. I’m sorry. Is that…helpful at all?
DOCTOR: A month is still quite broad, but we’ll work with that. And while I appreciate your honesty about your memory, we need to be as precise as possible for a proper assessment. Now, where is this swelling located?
PATIENT: It's mostly… here, on my neck. It’s not terribly painful, just… noticeable. It feels… soft, if that makes sense? Not hard or anything. And it seems to fluctuate a little, sometimes bigger, sometimes smaller. Is that… a relevant detail? I’m not sure what’s important to mention, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Fluctuating, soft… Alright. And has this swelling been accompanied by any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… not that I'm aware of. No pain, no fever, no difficulty breathing… I think not. I haven’t noticed anything else, but… it’s possible I’ve missed something. It’s hard to say, Doctor. I really don’t recall feeling unwell beyond the swelling itself.
DOCTOR: Right. And what about your medical history, Mr. Tomassoni?
PATIENT: My medical history… that's… a difficult question. I honestly don’t have a very clear recollection. I've generally been quite healthy, as far as I know. I don't have any major illnesses or anything I'm aware of. I have private insurance, if that's relevant? I haven't seen a doctor regularly in… well, a while. I apologize for the vagueness, Doctor. It’s frustrating for me as well.
DOCTOR: Do you have any known allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I'm aware of. I've never had a reaction to anything, as far as I can remember. I eat most things, and I’ve never had trouble with any medications. I'm quite certain about that, Doctor. Is there anything specific you’re looking for? Perhaps a list of common allergens I could consider? It’s just… my mind isn’t being very cooperative today.
DOCTOR: Very well. And are you currently taking any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, or herbal supplements?
PATIENT: No, none at all. I don’t take any medications, Doctor. I try to avoid them if possible. I haven’t needed anything… at least, not recently. I don’t recall ever being on a regular prescription, if that helps. I occasionally take something for a headache, perhaps, but nothing consistent.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's move on to a physical examination. I'm going to palpate your neck to assess the swelling. Please remain still. It is soft, as you described. No obvious signs of inflammation or tenderness… although, the consistency is slightly irregular. I also note some mild fullness in the submandibular region. Now, open your mouth for me, please. I'd like to examine your throat.
PATIENT: As you wish, Doctor. I hope I’m not making this difficult… it’s just… I tend to tense up when I’m being examined. Is there anything specific I should be doing? I'm happy to follow your instructions.
DOCTOR: Your tonsils appear normal in size and color. No visible exudate. The posterior pharynx is clear. Hmm. The swelling isn't significantly impeding your airway, but it is… atypical. Given your lack of a clear medical history, and the somewhat vague timeframe, I'm going to order a complete blood count and a thyroid stimulating hormone test. We need to rule out any underlying infection or thyroid abnormality.
PATIENT: That… sounds sensible, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to investigate. A complete blood count and a thyroid test… alright. Will I need to fast for the thyroid test? And where would I go to have these tests done? I apologize for asking so many questions, but I’m rather lost, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Yes, you will need to fast for the thyroid test – no food or drink for at least eight hours beforehand. You can go to the lab across the hall – they will take the necessary samples. The results should be available in approximately three to five business days. Here is the requisition form. Take this to the lab technician. In the meantime, if you experience any difficulty breathing, fever, or significant pain, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do not wait for the test results.
PATIENT: Alright, eight hours fasting… and the lab across the hall. I’ll remember that. Difficulty breathing, fever, significant pain… I understand, Doctor. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly. I will be sure to go to the emergency room if necessary. Is there anything else I should be aware of? Any specific precautions I should take? I just want to be prepared.
DOCTOR: No, not at this time. Avoid strenuous activity until we have the test results. We'll schedule a follow-up appointment once the lab results are available to discuss them and determine the next course of action. Do you have any further questions right now, Mr. Tomassoni?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I believe that covers everything. Thank you very much for your time and assistance. I appreciate your patience with my… lack of clarity. I’ll fast and go to the lab as instructed. Have a good day, Doctor Duplichan.
DOCTOR: Very well. You’re dismissed, Mr. Tomassoni.
