DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Heindel. I'm Dr. Press. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just... curiosity, really. I ain't really sick sick. Just thought I should get checked up, you know? Been a while.
DOCTOR: "Curiosity," you say. Well, preventative care is certainly admirable, though usually people come in with a complaint. Alright. Let's start with a bit of your history. Have you been feeling generally well?
PATIENT: Yeah, mostly. Work's work, you know? Long days on the boats, but I can handle it. No big problems. Sometimes my back gets a little sore, but that's about it. Lifting stuff all the time. Is that what you mean by 'complaint'? Like, is that a problem I should tell you about?
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Heindel, that is something I’d like to hear about. “Complaint” simply means anything that isn’t quite normal for you. Back soreness from lifting is… relevant. How long has your back been bothering you?
PATIENT: Hmm... a while now. On and off for maybe... two years? It usually goes away after a day or two of resting. I just figured it was part of the job. I ain’t never really needed to see a doctor about it before, so I just kinda ignored it. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It makes sense that you'd try to manage it yourself. However, ignoring things for two years isn't ideal. Do you experience any pain radiating down your legs?
PATIENT: No, not really. It mostly stays in my lower back. Sometimes it gets kinda tight, but it doesn't go down my legs. I do get a little numb sometimes, just a little tingling, but that doesn't happen all the time. Maybe when I've been lifting really heavy stuff. Is that a bad thing? Should I be worried about that tingling?
DOCTOR: Okay, the tingling is… something we’ll need to explore further. It could be nothing, but we don’t want to assume. Let's get a little more detail. Where exactly do you feel the numbness and tingling?
PATIENT: Uh... it's hard to say exactly. It's kinda... both legs, but not all the way down. More like… the tops of my feet, sometimes. And the backs of my legs, a little. It's not constant, like I said. It comes and goes. And it's not painful, just… weird. Does that help? I'm not very good at explaining things, sorry.
DOCTOR: It’s…adequate, Mr. Heindel. Alright. Let’s do a quick physical exam. I’d like to check your reflexes, muscle strength, and range of motion. If you could just lie down on the examination table for me, please.
PATIENT: Okay, sure. No problem. Is there a… gown or somethin'? I ain't really dressed for this. I just wore my work pants.
DOCTOR: No, no gown is necessary. Just lie down, and we’ll proceed. I'll need you to relax as much as possible. First, I'm going to test your reflexes.
PATIENT: Alright. Just let me know if I gotta do somethin', okay? I get kinda nervous at the doctor's office, even for just a check-up. Ain't been here in ages, like I said.
DOCTOR: Alright. Relax your leg… good. And now the other one… excellent. Both reflexes are present, though a bit diminished. Now, I'm going to lightly stroke the bottom of your feet. Just relax. Plantar reflex is normal. Now, let’s check your muscle strength. Can you squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: Okay, I'm tryin'. Is that enough? It's kinda hard to squeeze real tight, I been doin' a lot of rope work lately, my hands are kinda rough. Here, let's try this one too. It might be a little stronger, I think.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's helpful. Both grips are… weaker than I would expect for someone your age and occupation. Now, I’m going to ask you to resist my movements. I’ll push against your legs, and you just try to keep them still. Okay?
PATIENT: Okay, I can do that. Just tell me when you're gonna push. I'll try my best. I ain't super strong, but I can hold my own. Just let me know. Don't go too hard, okay? I don't wanna pull somethin'.
DOCTOR: Alright. Just relax... and push back. Okay. Both legs show some weakness. And do you feel any pain with these movements?
PATIENT: Yeah, a little. Not sharp pain, more like… a dull ache. In my lower back, kinda where it's been bothering me. It gets worse when you push on my legs. It's not awful, just… noticeable. Is somethin' wrong? You look kinda worried now.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Heindel. Based on what you've told me, and the findings of the physical exam, it's possible you have some nerve compression. The weakness and tingling, combined with the back pain, is concerning. Now, I need to order some imaging. We'll need an MRI of your lumbar spine. This will allow us to see if there's anything pressing on your nerves. It doesn’t necessarily mean anything serious, but we need to rule things out.
PATIENT: An MRI? That sounds… serious. Like, is somethin' really wrong? Is it my back? I just thought it was from work, you know? I ain't never had an MRI before. What's it like? And how much is that gonna cost? I only got Medicare, so I ain’t got a lot of extra money for stuff.
DOCTOR: Mr. Heindel, an MRI is a diagnostic test. It doesn’t mean something is wrong, it simply helps us find out if something is wrong. It’s a picture of your spine. As for the cost… I don’t have details on your Medicare coverage. You'll need to contact them directly to find out your out-of-pocket expenses. The imaging center will also have a billing department that can assist you. I’m going to write you a referral for the MRI. I’ll also order some bloodwork to rule out any inflammatory conditions. We'll get those results back in a few days. Do not attempt to lift anything heavy until we have the results. And if you experience any increased weakness, numbness, or bowel or bladder changes, go to the emergency room immediately. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Okay... no lifting. And go to the emergency room if somethin' gets worse. Okay, I can do that. No lifting... that's gonna be hard, but I can try. And the bloodwork... alright. So I gotta call Medicare and get the MRI scheduled... and then come back? And then you'll tell me what's wrong? I ain't very good at rememberin' things, Doctor. Can I get a paper with all this stuff on it? Just so I don't forget somethin'?
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Heindel. I'll write down the referral for the MRI, the order for the bloodwork, and a list of instructions. And I will also put in a note for you to follow up with me once you have those results. Here. This covers everything we discussed. And no, it is not ideal to be forgetting these things. Perhaps it would be wise to have a family member accompany you to future appointments to help keep track of things. Now, do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: No, I think that's it. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you explainin' stuff, even if I ask a lot of questions. I'll call Medicare tomorrow and try to get things scheduled. And I'll try not to lift nothin'.
DOCTOR: Very well. Have a good day, Mr. Heindel.
