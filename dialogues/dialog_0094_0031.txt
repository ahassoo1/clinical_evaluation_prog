DOCTOR: Good morning, Nixon. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Gegan. It’s nice to meet you. Why don’t you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Well, my left leg… it’s gotten quite swollen. It’s been a bit bothersome, and I know I have… a funny heartbeat sometimes, the doctor told me. It’s called… atrial fib… something. That’s why I’m here.
DOCTOR: Okay, Nixon. So you’ve noticed swelling in your left leg, and you have a history of atrial fibrillation – or “AFib” as we often call it. That’s helpful to know. Let's start with the leg swelling. When did you first notice it?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It started… maybe a week ago? It wasn’t too bad at first, just a little puffiness, really. But it’s gotten worse each day, I think. It feels… tight, and a bit achy. I haven't bumped it or anything, I don’t think.
DOCTOR: Alright, a week ago, gradually worsening swelling, tightness, and some aching. And no injury that you recall. Is the swelling constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It’s… mostly constant, yes. It’s worse at the end of the day, if that makes sense. Like, when I’ve been on my feet a lot. I teach, you see, so I’m up and walking quite a bit. It feels a bit better when I sit and put my feet up, but it doesn’t completely go away.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good information, Nixon. Worse at the end of the day with activity, and improves with elevation. Does the swelling affect your whole leg, or is it more localized – like your foot, ankle, or calf?
PATIENT: It’s… mostly in my calf, I think. And my ankle is a bit puffy too, but not as bad as my calf. My foot… well, I haven’t noticed much swelling in my foot, specifically. It’s definitely higher up, on my leg. I hope that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's perfectly clear. Calf and ankle swelling, more prominent in the calf. Now, let's talk about this atrial fibrillation you mentioned. How long have you been diagnosed with AFib?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. It was… a couple of years ago now, I believe. Maybe three? I had a funny turn, and they did some tests, and that's what they found. I don't think I’ve had it treated or anything, if that makes sense. I just… go for check-ups now and again, and they monitor it, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, diagnosed three years ago, and currently being monitored without specific treatment. Do you recall what your doctors have told you about why you aren't being treated, or what the plan for monitoring involves?
PATIENT: Hmm… they said something about… weighing the risks and benefits? I think they said the medication could have side effects, and my AFib wasn’t causing too many problems at the time. The plan… mostly just regular check-ups, and they check my heart rate, I think. I’m not very good at remembering these things, Doctor. It was all a bit overwhelming, to be honest. I just try to follow their instructions.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly understandable, Nixon. It can be overwhelming. We'll certainly review everything today. Do you experience any palpitations, shortness of breath, chest pain, or dizziness related to your AFib?
PATIENT: Oh, yes! The palpitations, definitely. My heart sometimes feels like it’s… fluttering, like a bird in my chest. And sometimes I get a little breathless when I walk up stairs, but I put that down to being out of shape, mostly. I haven’t had any chest pain or dizziness, thankfully. It's mostly just the fluttery feeling. And it happens… on and off, really. Not all the time.
DOCTOR: Okay, palpitations described as a fluttering sensation, and occasional shortness of breath with exertion. It sounds like your symptoms are intermittent. Now, let’s move on to some more general questions. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of! I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything, thankfully. I can eat most things, and I haven’t noticed any sensitivities. I’m quite lucky, really. Nothing springs to mind, Doctor.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, Nixon. And are you currently taking any medications at all – including over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, I don't take anything regularly. I might take a paracetamol now and again for a headache, but that’s about it. I try to avoid medication if I can, to be honest. I'm not a fan of taking pills, if you don’t mind me saying.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Nixon. Many people feel that way. Now, let's talk a little bit about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any other medical conditions besides the AFib?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I had… the usual childhood illnesses, I suppose. Chickenpox, measles, that sort of thing. And I had my tonsils out when I was a child, but that’s about it. Nothing major, I don’t think. No diabetes, no high blood pressure… the doctors always told me I was quite healthy, actually. Well, apart from the heart, of course.
DOCTOR: Okay, childhood illnesses and tonsillectomy. No other significant medical history. Have you ever had any surgeries besides the tonsillectomy?
PATIENT: No, nothing else. Just the tonsils, when I was little. I don’t really like hospitals, so I try to avoid them if I can, if you don’t mind me saying. Everything’s been quite straightforward, thankfully. I’ve been quite lucky, really.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, Nixon. Now, thinking about your family… is there any family history of heart disease, blood clots, or stroke?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. My… my grandfather, on my mother’s side, he had a heart attack, I think. A long time ago, though. And my aunt… she had a blood clot in her leg once, but that was years ago too. I don’t think anyone else in my family has had any heart problems, to be honest. It’s not a very healthy family, if you don’t mind me saying. They all smoke a lot, which I don’t do.
DOCTOR: Okay, grandfather with a heart attack, and an aunt with a blood clot. And finally, let’s talk a little bit about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, absolutely not! I don't smoke, I rarely drink alcohol – maybe a glass of wine at Christmas, but that’s about it. And I certainly don't use any recreational drugs. I'm a teacher, Doctor! I have a reputation to uphold. I try to live a healthy lifestyle, really. I eat a balanced diet and try to get plenty of exercise, although teaching keeps me on my feet enough, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Okay, Nixon. That's all very helpful information. Thank you for being so thorough. Now, would you mind if I conducted a brief physical exam to assess your leg swelling and listen to your heart and lungs?
PATIENT: Not at all, Doctor. Please, go ahead. I’m happy to do whatever you need. I trust your judgement completely. It’s just… the thought of examinations always makes me a little nervous, if you don’t mind me saying. But I’ll try my best to be cooperative.
DOCTOR: Of course, Nixon. That’s perfectly understandable. We’ll take it slowly. First, let’s have you lie down on the examination table. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs with my stethoscope. Just breathe normally. Your heart rate is a little fast, and I can hear a slightly irregular rhythm, consistent with your AFib. Your lungs sound clear. Now, let’s look at your legs. I’m going to measure the circumference of both calves to compare them. Your left calf is approximately 2 centimeters larger in circumference than your right calf. I'm also going to palpate your leg to check for tenderness and assess the pulses. There’s some mild tenderness to palpation in your left calf, and your pulses feel slightly weaker compared to your right leg. There is no obvious redness or warmth. Okay, Nixon. Based on the examination, there’s a clear difference in circumference between your calves, some tenderness to palpation, and slightly weaker pulses in the affected leg. These findings suggest some degree of swelling and potential venous insufficiency, but we need to rule out other causes, such as a blood clot.
PATIENT: Oh dear. A blood clot? That sounds… rather serious, if you don’t mind me saying. Is it likely? I haven’t felt any awful pain or anything, just the swelling and the ache. But if you think it’s necessary, I’m happy to have whatever tests you recommend. I trust your judgement, Doctor. Please, tell me what we should do next.
DOCTOR: You're right to be concerned, Nixon. A blood clot, or deep vein thrombosis , can be serious. However, the absence of severe pain doesn’t rule it out, and it's always best to be cautious. Given your symptoms and the exam findings, I'd like to order a D-dimer blood test and a lower leg ultrasound. The D-dimer test will help us assess if there's evidence of recent clot formation. The ultrasound will visualize the veins in your legs to check for any clots. I’m also going to order an EKG to monitor your heart rhythm more closely. While we wait for the results, I recommend elevating your left leg as much as possible, wearing compression stockings, and staying hydrated. Avoid prolonged standing or sitting without moving. Do you have any questions about these tests or recommendations?
PATIENT: No, that all sounds… sensible, if you don’t mind me saying. An ultrasound and blood tests… I can manage that. Compression stockings… I haven’t worn those before, but I’ll give it a try. And I’ll certainly try to put my feet up more. Where would I go to have these tests done? And how long will it take to get the results? I’m teaching next week, so I need to know if I need to make arrangements for a colleague to cover my classes. It’s just… a bit worrying, if you don’t mind me saying. But I appreciate you taking this seriously, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Of course, Nixon. I understand your concerns. The lab is just down the hall, and the ultrasound facility is located in the building across the parking lot. The lab should be able to draw the blood today, and the ultrasound can likely be scheduled for tomorrow morning. The lab results should be available within 24 hours, and the radiologist will send the ultrasound results directly to me. I should have both results by the end of the day tomorrow. I’ll call you as soon as I have the results, and we can discuss the next steps. In the meantime, if you experience any sudden, severe pain, redness, or warmth in your leg, or if you develop any shortness of breath or chest pain, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. And to reiterate, based on the initial exam, it's possible this is something less serious than a blood clot – like venous insufficiency – but we need to rule out the more dangerous possibilities first. We're being proactive. Do you have any questions at all?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. The lab and the ultrasound… I can manage that. And I’ll keep an eye out for any worsening symptoms, just in case. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly and taking my concerns seriously. It’s… reassuring to know you’re taking this seriously. I’ll go and get these tests done now. Thank you again, Doctor. And I’ll look forward to your call tomorrow.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Nixon. Please don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before tomorrow. Take care, and I'll speak to you soon.
