DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Tati. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Iuzzolino. It’s nice to meet you. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Uh... cough. I keep coughing. A long time already. And... tired also. Very tired. Feel weak, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, a cough and fatigue… and you feel weak. Alright. Could you tell me a little more about the cough?
PATIENT: Hmm... it's... wet cough. Always got stuff coming up. And... my nose, always blocked. Like... sinus, I think my wife say. I get it... many times. Every few months, I think.
DOCTOR: So, it's a productive cough – meaning you're bringing up mucus – and you have nasal congestion. Sounds like it may be related to your sinuses, as your wife mentioned. Do you have any pain in your face, maybe around your forehead or cheeks?
PATIENT: Pain... sometimes. Not all the time. When I blow my nose very hard, then pain. Like... pressure. And headache also. A little bit.
DOCTOR: Alright, facial pain with pressure when you blow your nose, and a little headache. Any fever, chills, or body aches with these episodes?
PATIENT: Fever... I don't know. Maybe? Sometimes feel warm, but I don't take temperature. Never take. Body ache... no, not really. Just... tired. Very, very tired. Like... no energy to do anything.
DOCTOR: Okay. And has anything made it better or worse?
PATIENT: Worse... when it's cold. Cold weather make it very bad. Better... when I rest. If I sleep, then a little bit better. But it always come back.
DOCTOR: Okay. Now, let's talk a little bit about your overall health. Do you have any other medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Other... no. I think not. I'm okay. Normal. Work every day. Tire repair, you know? Not easy work.
DOCTOR: Alright, no other medical conditions. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Surgery... no. Never. Hospital... one time. Long time ago. When I was small. Broken arm. Fall from tree. But okay now.
DOCTOR: Okay, a childhood broken arm. And what about your family?
PATIENT: Family... my wife, two children. They healthy. I think. No big problem. My father... he had cough also, when he was old. But he passed away already.
DOCTOR: I see. And do you know if your father had any other medical issues?
PATIENT: Uh... I don't know. He... old man. Cough, and... weak. That's all I remember. We not... close. He work very hard also.
DOCTOR: Okay. And are you allergic to any medications or anything else, like foods or environmental factors?
PATIENT: Allergies... no. I don't think so. Sometimes itchy skin, but I think it's just the dust. Lots of dust in the tire shop.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No. Nothing. I don't like to take medicine. I just... rest. And drink water. That's it.
DOCTOR: Okay. Alright, Mr. Tati. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. I'll listen to your lungs, check your sinuses, and take your temperature and blood pressure. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Okay. Yes. That's okay.
DOCTOR: Your lungs sound a bit congested, I hear some wheezing as well. Now, let’s check your sinuses. I'm going to gently press on your forehead and cheeks. Does that cause any pain?
PATIENT: Yes... a little bit. Here... And here... Not very bad, but I can feel it.
DOCTOR: Okay, I notice some tenderness to your sinuses. Your temperature is 99.2 Fahrenheit, which is slightly elevated, and your blood pressure is 130 over 85. Based on what you’ve told me and what I’ve found during the exam, it sounds like you may have a sinus infection, likely complicated by some bronchitis. The congestion in your lungs and the wheezing suggest that your airways are also inflamed.
PATIENT: Bronchitis? Sinus... what? I just have cough and tired. What does that mean? Is it serious?
DOCTOR: It means your airways are irritated and inflamed, likely from a virus or maybe a bacterial infection. The sinus infection is an inflammation of the passages in your nose and forehead, which can cause the congestion and facial pain you've been experiencing. It's not usually serious, but it can be very uncomfortable. It's important to get it treated so it doesn't develop into something more serious, like pneumonia. I'd like to prescribe you an antibiotic to help clear up the infection, and a decongestant to help with your nasal congestion. I'll also recommend that you get plenty of rest, drink lots of fluids, and avoid irritants like smoke and dust. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Antibiotic... okay. Medicine. I don't like medicine... but if it make me better... Dust... hard to avoid dust. Tire shop. What about the tired? Will the medicine help with the tired?
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation about the medicine. We'll try to use the lowest dose for the shortest amount of time possible. The antibiotic will help your body fight the infection, and as you recover, that should help with the fatigue as well. It’s not a direct fix for tiredness, but it will address the underlying cause. Rest and hydration are also very important for your energy levels. I'm going to write you a prescription for amoxicillin, to be taken three times a day for ten days. And I'll recommend a decongestant like pseudoephedrine, to be taken as directed on the label. I will also give you a handout with instructions on how to care for yourself at home, and a list of potential side effects to watch out for. Do you have any allergies to penicillin?
PATIENT: Penicillin... no. I don't think so. Never try it before. But what if I still feel tired after ten days? And what if I get more tired? I need to work, Doctor.
DOCTOR: That's a fair question. If you're still feeling fatigued after ten days of antibiotics, or if your symptoms worsen, I want you to schedule a follow-up appointment. We may need to run some additional tests to rule out other causes for your fatigue. It's possible the infection could be more stubborn, or there could be something else going on. We'll take it one step at a time. I will also provide you with a referral to a specialist if needed. Do you have insurance?
PATIENT: No. No insurance. Never have. Too expensive. Will it cost a lot? The specialist, you say? I just want to feel better, Doctor. Is there anything else I need to know?
DOCTOR: That does complicate things, but we'll work with what we have. We can look into some local resources that offer financial assistance for medical care. And I'll make sure to keep your costs in mind when considering any further testing or specialist referrals. For now, focus on getting plenty of rest, drinking lots of fluids, and taking the medication as prescribed. Avoid irritants as much as possible. I’m handing you a handout with some self-care tips and information on potential side effects of the medication. Please read it carefully. If you experience any severe side effects, such as difficulty breathing, chest pain, or a rash, please seek immediate medical attention. Do you have any questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: No... I think that's all. Thank you, Doctor. I hope the medicine work.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Tati. I hope so too. Remember to prioritize rest and hydration. And please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any concerns or questions. We’ll schedule a follow-up appointment in two weeks to see how you’re doing. Take care of yourself, and I hope you feel better soon. .
PATIENT: Okay. Thank you, Doctor. Goodbye.
