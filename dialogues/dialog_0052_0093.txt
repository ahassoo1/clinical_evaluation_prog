DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Redfern. My name is Dr. Patricia Shely. It’s a pleasure to meet you. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Yeah, hi. Look, to be honest, I barely remember why I booked this appointment. Something about... not sleeping great? And feeling a bit… blah. My wife usually handles this sort of thing, you see. She was very organized. I just… showed up, I guess. It's all a bit fuzzy. Is this a fitness thing too? I do fiddle with instruments all day, so I suppose I’m not completely sedentary.
DOCTOR: That’s quite alright, Mr. Redfern. It’s not uncommon to feel a little unclear on things, especially when schedules are busy. So, you’re experiencing some difficulty with sleep and a general feeling of being unwell – what we might call fatigue or malaise. And you mentioned you work with instruments – could you tell me a bit more about that?
PATIENT: Instruments, right. Yeah. I repair them, mostly. Violins, cellos, guitars… the whole lot. Been doing it for… a long time now. It's detailed work, you see. Lots of bending over, fine movements. Not exactly a gym workout, though. Mostly just… sitting. I tune them too, obviously. It's a bit of a dying trade, honestly. People just buy new ones when they break these days. Cheaper, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Thank you, that’s helpful. So, a physically detailed occupation with a good deal of sitting. And you said this has been going on for a “long time” – could you give me a sense of how long?
PATIENT: Ugh, “long time.” See, that's the problem. Honestly? It's been... since my wife passed, I think. Everything sort of blurred together after that. Maybe a year? Year and a half? It's hard to say. The sleep definitely got worse then, and I just haven’t… bothered getting it checked, I suppose. She always took care of all this.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Redfern. It's perfectly natural for routines and self-care to be disrupted after such a loss. It takes time to adjust. So, approximately a year to a year and a half of disrupted sleep and a general feeling of unwellness following your wife’s passing. To help me understand what's going on, could you describe what the sleep disruption is like?
PATIENT: Disruption… right. Well, it's not that I can’t fall asleep, necessarily. It’s more… staying asleep. I wake up. A lot. Usually in the middle of the night. And then I just… lie there. Thinking. Or… nothing. Just staring at the ceiling. It takes ages to get back to sleep, if I even do. And then I wake up feeling… not refreshed. You know? Just… tired. And sometimes I get… those little jolts when I'm drifting off. Like a tiny shock. Annoying, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, so difficulty maintaining sleep, frequent awakenings during the night, feeling unrefreshed upon waking, and you've also experienced some myoclonus – those little jolts as you're falling asleep. Now, aside from the sleep issues, can you describe this general feeling of being unwell?
PATIENT: Unwell… it’s just… a lack of energy, I suppose. I get tired easily. And I’m… a bit grumpy, if I'm honest. Not snapping at people or anything, but… less patient. And I’ve noticed I haven’t been… enjoying things as much. Usually I like a good cup of coffee and a bit of classical music, but lately it just… doesn’t hit the same. It’s hard to explain. It’s just… blah. Like everything is muffled, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like you’re experiencing some symptoms consistent with low mood and fatigue. Now, I’d like to ask a few questions to get a broader picture of your health. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: Appetite… hmm. I suppose not much. I eat when I feel hungry. Maybe a bit less than usual? Not deliberately, just… not as interested in food, I guess. And no real change in weight. My clothes still fit, anyway. I’m a fairly… solid build, always have been. Never had much luck with losing weight, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Thank you. And how about your bowel movements?
PATIENT: Ugh, really? Do you have to ask about that? Look, everything's… regular. I mean, as regular as it can be. I haven't been… struggling with that, if that's what you mean. Honestly, I'd rather talk about the instruments.
DOCTOR: I apologize if that was too personal, Mr. Redfern. It’s simply part of a routine assessment. Thank you for answering. Now, I’d like to ask about any other medical conditions you may have, or have had in the past. Have you ever been diagnosed with anything like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: High blood pressure… no. Diabetes, definitely not. My wife always made sure we ate healthy. Heart problems… no. The doctor did tell me my cholesterol was a bit high a few years back, but they said I could manage it with diet. I tried, mostly.
DOCTOR: Thank you. And have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… hmm. Let me think. I had my appendix out when I was a kid, I suppose. That was a long time ago. And… nothing else, I don't think. A few minor things, like getting stitches when I was clumsy, but nothing major.
DOCTOR: Thank you. Now, regarding medications, are you currently taking any prescription or over-the-counter drugs, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Just the cholesterol medication. Atorvastatin, I think it's called? Small dose. And… occasionally, I take some ibuprofen for aches and pains. Mostly when I've been bending over the instruments all day. That's it. Nothing else.
DOCTOR: Thank you. And finally, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… no, not really. I mean, I get hay fever in the spring, but that's about it. Nothing serious. No reactions to any medications that I know of.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Redfern. That’s a very thorough overview. Now, I’d like to conduct a brief physical examination. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, fine. Whatever you need to do. Honestly, I'm just hoping you can figure out why I'm always so tired.
DOCTOR: Your blood pressure is 138/82, which is slightly elevated. Your pulse is 72 beats per minute, temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit, and your respiration rate is 16 breaths per minute. Now, I'll listen to your heart and lungs. Please take some deep breaths for me. Your heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Your lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Your abdomen is soft, non-tender, and non-distended. I'm not feeling any masses or organomegaly. Now, let's take a look at your throat and ears. Your throat is clear, no signs of infection. Your ears are also clear. Finally, I'd like to check your reflexes. Your reflexes are normal. Overall, the physical exam findings are largely unremarkable, though your blood pressure is slightly elevated. It doesn’t necessarily indicate a serious problem, but it’s something we’ll want to monitor.
PATIENT: Slightly elevated, huh? My wife always said I worried too much. So, what does that mean? Is it the cholesterol? Is it the tiredness? Is it… something worse? Honestly, I just want to feel normal again. Just have some energy, sleep through the night… is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: It's understandable to be concerned, Mr. Redfern, and it's perfectly reasonable to want to feel like yourself again. Based on what you've told me and the physical exam, it’s unlikely to be something immediately concerning. However, several factors could be contributing to your fatigue and sleep disruption. The slightly elevated blood pressure is something we’ll want to keep an eye on, and lifestyle modifications, such as diet and exercise, could be beneficial. Your cholesterol medication is also important, and it’s good you’re taking it as prescribed. However, your symptoms—fatigue, sleep disturbance, decreased energy, and anhedonia—are also consistent with depression or an adjustment disorder following your loss. It doesn’t necessarily mean you have a clinical diagnosis, but it’s something we need to consider. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order some blood work. This will check your thyroid function, vitamin D levels, complete blood count, and basic metabolic panel. It will help rule out any underlying medical causes for your fatigue. I’d also like to administer a brief questionnaire called the PHQ-9, which is a standardized assessment for depression. It’s just a series of questions, and it will help me better understand your mood and thought patterns. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: A questionnaire… about my mood? I suppose so. If it helps. Honestly, I’m not sure what good talking about it will do. It just… is. But if you think it’s necessary… fine. And the blood work… yeah, okay. Whatever you need. Just… try not to keep me waiting too long for the results, alright? I just want to get this sorted, and get back to… well, just being.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Redfern. I completely understand your hesitation, and I won't push you to discuss anything you’re not comfortable with. The questionnaire is simply a tool to help us gather information. We can discuss the results together, and I will explain everything in detail. I’ll have the lab order sent to the front desk, and they’ll schedule you for blood work. It usually takes a few days to get the results back, and I'll contact you as soon as they are available. In the meantime, I’m going to recommend some lifestyle modifications that may help improve your sleep and energy levels. Try to establish a regular sleep schedule, going to bed and waking up at the same time each day, even on weekends. Avoid caffeine and alcohol before bed. Regular exercise, even a short walk, can also be beneficial. Finally, and this may sound cliché, but it’s important to find ways to engage in activities you enjoy. It sounds like you enjoy music, so perhaps dedicating some time to that could be helpful. I also want to provide you with some resources for grief support. The loss of your wife must have been incredibly difficult, and there’s no shame in seeking help. I can provide you with some brochures and contact information for local support groups and counseling services. Does that all sound reasonable, Mr. Redfern?
PATIENT: Reasonable… yeah, I suppose so. A regular sleep schedule… I haven’t had one of those in a while. Exercise… music… I guess I can try. I just… don’t have much energy for trying, you know? The grief support… thank you. I appreciate that. I haven’t really… talked to anyone about it, to be honest. It just feels… strange. I guess… yeah. Okay. Let’s just get the blood work done, and see what it says. And… thank you, Doctor. For listening.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Redfern. Taking the first step is often the hardest part, and you’ve already done that by coming in today. And please, don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns, even if it’s just to talk. The front desk will schedule your blood work now. Once the results are in, my nurse will contact you to schedule a follow-up appointment. In the meantime, take care of yourself, Mr. Redfern. And remember, you're not alone. .
PATIENT: .
