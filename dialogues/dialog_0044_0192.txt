DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Hartness. Welcome to the clinic. It’s a pleasure to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Yeah, hi. Look, I don't really do small talk, so... it's the exam. For the army. Gotta get this done, you know? They want me to take it. Seems silly, but here I am.
DOCTOR: Right, the army physical. Absolutely. No problem at all, we do quite a few of those. It's good you're getting it taken care of. Just to be thorough, even though it’s for the army, could you tell me a little bit about why they're requesting the exam now?
PATIENT: Why now? Honestly? They just… called. Said I needed to. I applied a while back, figured nothing would come of it. Then this guy called, said I was next up. Wants me to prove I'm not falling apart, I guess. Seems a bit much, but... can't argue with the army, right?
DOCTOR: No, you certainly can’t argue with the army! That's fair. So, as far as you know, there haven’t been any specific concerns raised about your health?
PATIENT: Concerns? No. Look, I work with engines all day. Heavy lifting, greasy hands, the usual. I'm strong. Always have been. I eat okay, sleep okay. Never been sick, really. Aside from a cold now and then, which everyone gets. They're just being… careful, I suppose. You don't look like you could lift an engine, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Well, I leave the engine lifting to the experts, like yourself! It sounds like you’re generally quite healthy, which is excellent. To get started with the physical, let’s just go through a bit of a medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, asthma, or anything else?
PATIENT: Diagnosed? No. Never. I told you, I'm strong. Healthy. I've broken a few bones over the years, working. A finger here, a wrist there. Nothing serious. Doctor patched me up, I went back to work. No long-term problems. You're asking a lot of questions, you know? Is this normal? It feels like a waste of time.
DOCTOR: It is a lot of questions, I apologize. But it's important for me to have a complete picture, even if you've always been healthy. It helps me make sure everything is as it should be and identify anything that might need a little extra attention. Broken bones are good to know, though – especially if they were recent. Do you remember roughly when you broke your finger and wrist?
PATIENT: Roughly? Hmm. The finger was… maybe ten years ago? Working on a Ford, slipped with a wrench. Wrist… probably fifteen years ago? Fell off a ladder while fixing a roof. Nothing fancy, you know? Just regular work accidents. They healed fine. I didn't bother going back to the doctor after they put a cast on. Cast came off, I went back to work. Are we getting anywhere with this? I got things to do.
DOCTOR: Yes, we are getting there, Mr. Hartness. Thank you for that. Now, have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries? No. Never had surgery. Why would I need surgery? I fix things, I don't get fixed. This is ridiculous. I'm perfectly capable of telling you if something is wrong. You're asking about things that haven’t happened.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Hartness. I apologize if the questions seem unnecessary. It's standard procedure for a comprehensive physical, even for someone as active as yourself. Just a few more questions to be thorough. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. Absolutely not. I eat everything. Don't get sick, remember? Dust gets me sometimes, but that's it. Not an allergy, just… makes me sneeze. Look, I work around grease and metal all day. If I was allergic to something, I'd know about it. This is just… pointless.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications – prescription or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: Medications? No. Never take anything. Waste of money. If I get a headache, I drink some water. If I'm tired, I sleep. Honestly, are we going to actually do something today, or are you just going to keep asking questions? This is a waste of my time. And frankly, it’s a bit insulting. I'm a perfectly healthy man.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Hartness, and I sincerely apologize if I’m causing you to feel insulted. That is absolutely not my intention. I assure you, I am getting to a point where we can begin the physical examination. However, it's vital I cover this information to ensure the most accurate assessment. One last thing, then we can proceed. Do you have any family history of significant medical conditions – things like heart disease, diabetes, cancer, or anything else that runs in your family?
PATIENT: Family history? Hmm. My father... he smoked. A lot. Died young, lung cancer. Mother… she was fine, I think. Lived a long life, just… old age. No one else, really. We weren't a family that went to doctors much. That's about it. Are we finally done with the questions? I'm starting to feel like I'm being interrogated.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Hartness. That is very helpful, and I truly appreciate your patience. You are right, we are finished with the questions. Now, let’s move on to the physical examination. I'll start by checking your vital signs – your blood pressure, pulse, temperature, and respiration. Then, I’d like to listen to your heart and lungs, and take a look at your ears, nose, and throat. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. Just get it over with. Don’t expect me to hold still for long if it's uncomfortable. I've got work to do.
DOCTOR: Of course. I’ll do my best to make it as quick and comfortable as possible. First, I’m going to take your blood pressure. Could you please extend your arm?
PATIENT: Just get it over with. Don’t squeeze too tight, alright? I need this arm for work.
DOCTOR: Okay, your blood pressure is 140/90. That’s a little elevated. Now, let's listen to your heart. Please take a deep breath for me… and exhale. Your heartbeat is regular, but I can hear a slight murmur. Nothing alarming at this point, but it's something we'll want to keep an eye on. Take a few deep breaths in and out… and again. Your lungs sound clear. Now, let's just take a quick look in your ears, nose, and throat. Could you open your mouth and say "Ah"?
PATIENT: Ah! Is that good enough? Look, I told you I was fine. You’re making a big deal out of nothing.
DOCTOR: Your throat looks clear, no signs of infection. Your ears also look clear, no wax buildup or inflammation. Now, let’s check your reflexes. Right leg… and left leg. Both reflexes are present and equal. Finally, let's just do a quick range of motion check. Can you raise your arms over your head?
PATIENT: See? Perfectly fine. Everything's working. Can we be done now? I really need to get back to work.
DOCTOR: Yes, we are almost finished. Your range of motion is excellent. Overall, you are in good physical condition for your age. However, there are a few things I want to discuss. Your blood pressure is slightly elevated at 140/90, and I did detect a slight heart murmur. These aren't necessarily cause for immediate alarm, but they warrant further investigation. I recommend we get an EKG and some blood work to rule out any underlying issues. I also suggest lifestyle modifications, like reducing sodium intake and incorporating regular exercise. Would you be open to those recommendations?
PATIENT: Lifestyle modifications? Exercise? Look, I work hard all day. That's exercise enough. And I eat what I want. I'm not changing my diet. As for the tests… I don’t know. Will it stop me from joining the army? That's what I'm worried about.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Hartness. The tests are primarily to ensure your overall health and well-being, and to identify any potential issues that might require attention. As for whether it will affect your ability to join the army, that depends on the results and the army’s specific requirements. We can discuss the findings with the recruiter if you’d like. However, even if there are minor issues, they might not be disqualifying. We can work together to address any concerns and potentially get you cleared for service. Would you like me to order the EKG and blood work now?
PATIENT: Fine. Order the tests. But if it stops me from joining, I'm holding you responsible. And don't expect me to come back for any follow-up appointments. I'm a busy man. Get it done quickly.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Hartness. I’ve ordered the tests, and you should receive a call from the lab to schedule an appointment. The results will be sent to me, and I'll contact you as soon as I have them. I understand you're busy, and I’ll try to be as efficient as possible. Even though you're hesitant about follow-up, I strongly recommend scheduling a brief appointment to discuss the results and address any concerns you may have. It's important for your health. Here’s a list of local labs. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No. Just get it over with. And don’t bother calling if it's bad news. I'll figure it out.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Hartness. You have a good day. .
