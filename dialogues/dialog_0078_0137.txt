DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Abdollahi. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Lessie Solero. It’s a pleasure to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. My… my family want me to go to a… a place for older people. A senior… living? They say I need to make sure I am… okay… before I go. They want a paper, maybe? From you.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It sounds like your family is being very thoughtful, wanting to ensure you’re in good health before considering a move to a senior living facility. A health assessment is a very good idea, and yes, I can certainly provide a document outlining your current health status. To start, could you tell me a little bit more about why your family is suggesting this now?
PATIENT: They… they say I forget things. Little things. Where I put my glasses. What I eat for breakfast. Not big things! But… they worry. My husband, he… he do more and more for me. I still cook, I still clean… but sometimes… I need help.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful to know. It's very common to experience some memory lapses as we get older, and it sounds like you're still very active and independent, which is wonderful. We’ll definitely look into this further. To get a better picture, could you tell me a bit more about these instances of forgetting?
PATIENT: Well… yesterday, I make coffee. For me and my husband. I put the sugar in… but I forget which cup was his! He likes two, I like one. I had to ask him. And… last week, I go to the store for milk… and I come back with bread. Not milk! Little things. Like that. Is that bad, Doctor? I don't feel sick.
DOCTOR: Those do sound frustrating, Ms. Abdollahi. And it’s good you’re aware of them. Forgetting things occasionally, especially when it comes to minor details, isn’t necessarily a cause for alarm. But it's important to understand why it’s happening. It could be a lot of things – stress, changes in routine, even certain medications. To help me get a clearer picture, let’s talk a little more about your overall health. Have you noticed any other changes recently?
PATIENT: Other changes…? Hmm. My… my knees bother me more. Always do, but worse lately. And I get tired… more quick now. I used to garden all day. Now… I sit more. I still like to garden, but… I can’t for long. Is that… part of getting old? I eat good. Mostly. My husband like sweets, so… there is cookies sometimes.
DOCTOR: Those are important things to mention, Ms. Abdollahi. Knee pain and fatigue are certainly common as we age, but we need to rule out other possible causes. It's good you eat well overall. Let’s go through a quick review of your medical history, if you don't mind. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Let me think… I have… high blood pressure. The doctor put me on pills for that, many years ago. And I had a little… a little problem with my heart, a long time ago. They gave me… something… to make it better. I don't remember the name of it. And… I break my wrist once, falling in the garden! That was a long time ago too. They put a cast on.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's very helpful. High blood pressure, a history of a cardiac issue, and a past wrist fracture. Do you currently take any medications for your high blood pressure or anything else?
PATIENT: Yes. I take a white pill… every morning. For the blood pressure. And… a little yellow pill sometimes, when my knees are bad. My husband give it to me. He keeps track of everything. I don’t remember the names. He knows. I trust him.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know you have support with your medications. It's completely normal not to remember all the details. We'll make sure we get a complete and accurate list. Now, have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Let me see… I have my tonsils out when I was a little girl. And… the wrist, when I fall. They put… something in. To fix it. I don't think that's a surgery, really. Just… a cast. That's all I remember. I never had a big surgery, like on my stomach. Not that I remember.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. Now, thinking about your family, do you have any family history of memory problems, heart disease, or other medical conditions?
PATIENT: Hmm… my mother, she… she got a little confused at the end. She forget things. Like me, maybe? Not bad, but… she needed help. And my father, he have a bad heart. He died when he was young. And my brother… he have the high blood pressure too. Like me. Is that important, Doctor? Family stuff?
DOCTOR: Yes, that is important, Ms. Abdollahi. Family history can give us clues about potential risks. Knowing your mother experienced some confusion and your father had heart disease is helpful. And your brother having high blood pressure as well. Now, let’s talk about your lifestyle. Do you smoke or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never smoke. And I… I have a little glass of wine sometimes. With dinner. Just one. My husband too. It's… a habit. We don’t drink much. Not every night. Just… special occasions. Or when it’s cold. A little bit.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to know. Now, just one last question about your medical history. Do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No… no allergies. Not that I know of. I eat everything. Sometimes my skin get a little itchy when I’m in the garden, but that’s just the plants, maybe? I never have a bad reaction to anything. Not pills, not food… nothing. I think I would remember if I was allergic to something! Would I not?
DOCTOR: Yes, you absolutely would. Okay, Ms. Abdollahi, that gives me a very good overview of your health history. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical exam, if that’s alright with you. We’ll check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and do a few simple tests to assess your memory and balance. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… good. I trust you. Do whatever you need to do. I just want to… be okay. For my family. And for myself. So… let's do it. Blood pressure first? Is that cold?
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful. And yes, let’s start with your blood pressure. It won’t be cold, just a little pressure on your arm. Your blood pressure is 142/88. That's a little elevated, but not drastically so. We’ll keep an eye on that. Now, let's listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. I don’t hear any unusual sounds. Now, I’d like to do a few simple tests to check your memory and balance. This will just involve me asking you a few questions and having you perform a few simple tasks. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Ask away. I’ll try my best. It's okay if I forget… right? My husband always tell me, "Don't worry so much!" But I do. A little. It's a habit.
DOCTOR: It's perfectly alright if you forget. This isn’t a test to punish you, it's just to get a baseline understanding. And your husband sounds like a very supportive man. Okay, first, can you tell me what year it is?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Is it… 2024? No… wait. Is it… 2025? Yes! 2025. I think. August, right? It’s August now. I remember that much. The hot month. Is that good?
DOCTOR: That’s excellent, Ms. Abdollahi. Yes, it is August 2nd, 2025. You remembered perfectly. Now, I’m going to ask you to recall three words. I’ll say them slowly, and I’d like you to repeat them back to me after I’m finished. Ready?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Ready. Tell me the words. I’ll try to remember. I’m good at remembering… things! Sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, the three words are: apple, table, penny. Repeat them back to me when you're ready. Take your time.
PATIENT: Hmm… apple… table… and… penny! Yes! Apple, table, penny. I got them! Is that good, Doctor? I was worried I would forget already. It's funny how the mind works. My husband says…
DOCTOR: That's wonderful, Ms. Abdollahi! You remembered them perfectly. Very good. Now, I’m going to ask you to count backwards from 100 by sevens. It's a bit tricky, so don't worry if you stumble a little. Just do your best.
PATIENT: Oh… oh dear. Count backwards? By sevens? That sounds… hard. I'm not very good at numbers, never have been. My husband always do the bills. Let me try… 100… 93? Is that right? It feels wrong. I always mess up the numbers. I'm sorry.
DOCTOR: That's alright, Ms. Abdollahi. It is challenging. You got started correctly with 93. Don't worry about getting it perfect. We’re just trying to get a sense of how things are. If it’s too difficult, we can stop. Would you like to stop?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I think I should stop. It's making my head hurt a little. I knew I wasn't good at numbers. My husband will laugh at me! He always says I'm better with… with flowers. And cooking. Not numbers. I'm sorry I mess up.
DOCTOR: You haven’t messed up at all, Ms. Abdollahi. It's perfectly alright to stop. This wasn't a test to evaluate your intelligence, it was just a quick assessment of cognitive function. And it’s wonderful that you’re skilled in other areas – gardening and cooking are very important skills! Now, let’s do a brief balance test. Could you please stand up for me?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Standing up… here I go. I’m a little wobbly. My knees aren’t what they used to be. Is this okay? I don’t want to fall.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright. Take your time, and hold onto the chair if you need to. You’re doing great. Now, I’d like you to close your eyes and stand for about 30 seconds. Again, please hold onto the chair if you need to, and I’ll be right here to steady you. Are you ready?
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. Close my eyes… This is scary. I feel like I'm going to fall. Please don't let me fall. My knees are shaking… How long is 30 seconds? It feels like a very long time…
DOCTOR: You’re doing wonderfully, Ms. Abdollahi. You’re very steady. Just breathe deeply. It's okay. Almost there. And… okay, you can open your eyes now. You did very well. Now, let’s move on to a quick check of your reflexes. I’m just going to tap on your knees with this little hammer. It won’t hurt, but let me know if it’s uncomfortable.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. Reflexes… That sounds… strange. Is this like when they check babies? I don’t like this very much. But if you say it’s okay… go ahead. Just be gentle, please. My legs are a little sensitive.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Abdollahi. That was very good. Your reflexes are a bit diminished, which is common at your age, but nothing to be concerned about. Okay, that completes the physical exam. Now, do you have any specific questions for me, or anything else you'd like to discuss?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think… I think you asked everything. I just… I just want to be okay. For my family. They worry so much. And I don’t want to be a burden. Is… is there something wrong with my memory? Is that why they want me to go to the… the place? Will I… will I be alone?
DOCTOR: Those are very valid concerns, Ms. Abdollahi. It’s completely understandable that you're feeling anxious. Based on my assessment today, your memory is showing some expected changes for your age, and some mild difficulty with recall and certain cognitive tasks. It does not appear to be anything severe. The difficulty you’re experiencing is likely contributing to your family's concerns. They love you and want to ensure you’re safe and well-supported. Moving to a senior living facility can provide that support, but it’s important to remember that it doesn’t mean you’re alone. They offer social activities, medical care, and a sense of community. However, we need to determine the best course of action together. I recommend a more comprehensive cognitive evaluation with a specialist – a neurologist or neuropsychologist – to get a clearer picture of your cognitive function and rule out any underlying causes. Would you be open to that?
PATIENT: A… a specialist? That sounds… scary. Does that mean something is very wrong? I don’t want to be poked and prodded. And I don’t want to be… labeled. My husband… he’ll worry so much. I just want to be left alone. I think I just need to rest more. Maybe that’s all.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Abdollahi. It's perfectly normal to feel anxious about seeing a specialist. It doesn’t necessarily mean something is very wrong. It simply means we’re taking a more thorough look to understand what’s going on. And it’s absolutely not about labeling you. It's about getting the right information so we can make the best decisions for your health and well-being. The tests are usually non-invasive – things like answering questions, performing simple tasks, and maybe a brain scan, which is like a special X-ray. We can take things at your pace, and I’ll be here to support you every step of the way. If you’re not comfortable with a specialist right now, we can explore other options. But I do believe a comprehensive evaluation would be beneficial. For now, let's focus on what we can do. We can schedule a follow-up appointment in a few weeks to see how you're doing. I’ll also provide you with some resources for memory support and exercises you can do at home. How does that sound?
PATIENT: That… that sounds better. A follow-up appointment. And… some exercises. Not poked and prodded right away. And my husband can come with me? He always knows what to do. He can ask the questions. I forget things… you know. He'll remember. And… will you talk to him? He worries so much about me. Maybe you can explain it to him. Make him feel better. That’s all I want. Just… for everyone to be okay.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Abdollahi. Of course, your husband is more than welcome to come with you to the follow-up appointment, and I would be happy to speak with him directly. I understand he’s concerned, and I can certainly explain my assessment in more detail and answer any questions he may have. We’ll take this one step at a time, and we’ll work together to ensure everyone feels comfortable and supported. I’ll schedule the follow-up appointment now, and I’ll also provide you with some information about memory support resources in the meantime. Here's a referral for the neurologist, just in case you decide you'd like to pursue a more comprehensive evaluation. No pressure at all. And here’s a list of some simple brain exercises you can do at home to help keep your mind active. Do you have any questions for me before we finish today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think… I think you answered everything. Thank you. For being… nice. And for not yelling at me for forgetting things. And for talking to my husband. He'll be so relieved. I just… I just want to go home now. And rest. And maybe… maybe bake some cookies. That always makes me feel better.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Abdollahi. It was my pleasure meeting you, and I'm glad I could ease your concerns. Baking cookies sounds like a wonderful idea. Here’s the information for our office, and please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. Take care of yourself, and enjoy your cookies. I look forward to seeing you again soon.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too.
DOCTOR: Goodbye, Ms. Abdollahi. Have a lovely day! .
