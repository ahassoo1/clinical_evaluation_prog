DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Sucich. My name is Dr. Talen Delacour. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. To start, could you tell me what brings you into the clinic?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you, Doctor Delacour. Nice to meet you too. Well, it’s these hiccups, you see. They just won’t stop! Started a couple of days ago, and they’re… persistent, to say the least. Not painful, just… annoying, really. I thought they’d go away on their own, but here I am.
DOCTOR: I see. Persistent hiccups can certainly be bothersome, even if not painful. To help me understand what might be causing them, could you tell me a bit more about when they started exactly?
PATIENT: Let me think… it was Tuesday, I believe. Yes, Tuesday morning. I was having my tea on the veranda, watching the birds, and… hic! …there it was, the first one. Seemed strange, because I wasn’t eating or drinking anything quickly, or getting excited, or anything. Just… hic! …sitting there. It’s been pretty much constant since then, though they come and go in waves, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Yes, that does make sense. Constant hiccups with waves of intensity. And you haven’t noticed anything specific that seems to trigger them, or make them worse?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. Nothing obvious, no. I did have a bit of a longer walk on Wednesday – went to visit my cousin, about a mile each way – and they felt a little worse afterwards, but I don’t know if that was just coincidence. And I was telling my friend, Lisi, about them yesterday, and I had a bit of a laugh, but that didn't seem to do anything either. Honestly, I’ve been trying to think of everything, but I can’t pinpoint anything. It's just…random. hic!
DOCTOR: I understand. Random onset hiccups can be puzzling. Now, aside from the hiccups themselves, have you noticed any other symptoms at all?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see... no, not really. No pain, no heartburn, no trouble breathing, nothing like that. My appetite's been normal, I'm sleeping alright... everything feels pretty normal, apart from, well, hic!, this. I haven't felt feverish or anything like that, either. Just… these pesky hiccups. I am a bit tired, but that's just old age catching up with me, I think! hic!
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear that you haven't experienced any other concerning symptoms. And you are correct, fatigue can be quite common with age. Let's move on to your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think. I had my gallbladder out years ago, back in the eighties, I think it was. And I had a touch of arthritis in my knees for a while, but it’s pretty mild now. Just a bit of stiffness sometimes. Apart from that… no, nothing major, really. I've been lucky, I suppose. I’ve always been quite healthy, though I do worry a bit now that I’m getting older, of course. hic! I try to stay active, you know?
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear you've been generally healthy. Having your gallbladder removed and a history of mild arthritis are helpful to know. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I'm aware of. I've never had a reaction to anything, not even when I was a child. My mother always said I had a cast-iron stomach. hic! Though, to be honest, I don’t take much in the way of medication these days. Just a bit of paracetamol if I have a headache, and sometimes a cream for my knees when they're acting up. Nothing regular, though. I prefer to avoid pills if I can!
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. So, no known allergies and only occasional use of paracetamol and a topical cream for your knees. Now, could you please tell me about any medications you are currently taking, even over-the-counter ones, and their dosages, if you remember?
PATIENT: Like I said, Doctor, not much. Honestly. I take one small paracetamol tablet maybe once a month, if that. Sometimes two if I've really overdone it in the garden. And the cream for my knees is a Diclofenac gel, I think it's called. I just rub a little on a couple of times a week when they're sore. I keep it in the bathroom cupboard. The bottle says 1.16% – is that what you need to know? hic! I don't really pay much attention to numbers, to be honest, I just know it helps.
DOCTOR: Yes, 1.16% is helpful to know. Diclofenac gel used a couple of times a week as needed, and paracetamol occasionally. Thank you. Now, before we proceed, I'd like to quickly review your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Oh, family history… now there’s a long story. My mother had high blood pressure, I think. And my father had diabetes, though he didn't look after himself very well, to be honest. My sister had some heart trouble later in life, but she didn't live to a very old age. And my son… well, he's perfectly healthy, thankfully. hic! No, I don't think there's anything else major. Lots of us lived to a good age, though, so maybe good genes help too! hic! Does that help? I’m trying to remember everything… it’s been a long life, you know.
DOCTOR: Yes, that is very helpful, Ms. Sucich. History of high blood pressure, diabetes, and heart trouble in the family. Now, I would like to ask about your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no! hic! Never smoked a day in my life. My mother wouldn't allow it, and I never took to it. And I don't drink much alcohol, just a small glass of sherry at Christmas, maybe. And as for those things… well, that's just not my cup of tea. hic! Always been a bit of a homebody, you see. I prefer a good book and a cup of tea to anything like that! I used to love gardening, but my knees aren’t what they used to be, sadly.
DOCTOR: I understand. No smoking, minimal alcohol consumption, and no recreational drug use. Now, before I conduct a brief physical exam, could you tell me your approximate height and weight?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Well, I used to be quite tall. Five foot nine, I think. Maybe five foot eight now, things shrink as you get older, you know? And weight… oh dear. I try not to think about it too much! But I'd say around 150 pounds. Perhaps a little more these days, after all the Christmas biscuits. hic! It fluctuates a bit, you see. I haven't been weighed properly in ages.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Sucich. Approximately 5’8” and 150 pounds. Now, if you'll permit me, I’d like to listen to your heart and lungs, and briefly examine your abdomen and knees. This will help me assess whether there's anything obvious contributing to the hiccups. Would you mind stepping up on the table for me?
PATIENT: Oh, of course, Doctor. Anything you think will help. hic! My knees aren’t the best, as I mentioned, but I’ll manage. hic! Just let me know if you want me to do anything special. It's a bit cold, isn't it?
DOCTOR: Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Your abdomen is soft and non-tender. Your knees do have some crepitus, which is common with age and arthritis, but no evidence of acute inflammation. Blood pressure is 148/82. Pulse is 78 and regular. Temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit. Based on the examination, there’s no immediate cause for concern. The crepitus in your knees is likely contributing to your overall discomfort, but it doesn’t appear to be directly causing the hiccups. The blood pressure is slightly elevated, but within an acceptable range for your age.
PATIENT: Oh, that’s reassuring to hear, Doctor. hic! So, what do you think is causing these pesky things? I mean, you said there’s nothing obviously wrong… is it just one of those things? I don’t mind taking some medication if it will help, though I really do prefer to avoid it if possible. hic! It's just so… irritating, constantly interrupting everything.
DOCTOR: You are right to ask that question. Persistent hiccups, lasting more than 48 hours, can sometimes indicate an underlying issue. However, in your case, given your age, otherwise good health, and the absence of any other concerning symptoms, it’s likely that this is what we call idiopathic hiccups – meaning there’s no identifiable cause. Sometimes they just happen. However, because they have been persistent for a couple of days now, and are causing you distress, I would like to rule out a few possibilities with some basic blood tests. I’d like to check your electrolyte levels, kidney function, and a complete blood count. These will help us ensure there isn’t an underlying metabolic imbalance contributing to the hiccups. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, Doctor, that sounds sensible. If it will help find out what’s going on, I’m happy to have the tests. I don’t mind a little needle prick if it means getting rid of these pesky hic! things. It's just… I do hope they don't find anything too worrying. But better to be safe than sorry, I suppose. And what about medication in the meantime? Is there anything I can take to help calm them down, even a little?
DOCTOR: That’s a very sensible approach, Ms. Sucich. I completely agree – it's always best to investigate. As for medication, there are a few options, but their effectiveness varies. Baclofen and chlorpromazine are sometimes used, but they have potential side effects, and I’m hesitant to prescribe them without a clearer understanding of the cause. In the meantime, there are a few things you can try at home. Sipping ice water slowly, holding your breath for a short period , and swallowing a teaspoon of sugar have been known to help in some cases. These are unlikely to have any significant side effects. I’m going to order a complete blood count, a basic metabolic panel, and electrolyte levels. The phlebotomist will come in shortly to draw the samples. Once we have the results, we’ll discuss them and determine the best course of action. Do you have any allergies to latex or other materials that I should be aware of before the blood draw?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s kind of you to ask, Doctor. hic! No, no allergies that I know of. I've been getting injections for years, and never had a problem. Ice water and sugar… hic! I've tried ice water, actually, but it didn't seem to do much. I’ll try the sugar, though. It can’t hurt, can it? And thank you for explaining everything so clearly. It puts my mind at ease to know what’s going on. I just hope these results come back quickly. hic! It’s quite distracting, you know, having them all the time.
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Ms. Sucich. I understand your frustration. It's good that you've already tried the ice water. The sugar is a simple step, and sometimes it works surprisingly well. The phlebotomist should be with you shortly. They’ll explain the procedure. The results typically take 24-48 hours to come back, and my office will contact you as soon as they are available. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms – such as shortness of breath, chest pain, or severe abdominal pain – please contact my office immediately, or go to the nearest emergency room. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think you've covered everything, Doctor. hic! You’ve been very thorough, and I appreciate your patience. It's just… I’m looking forward to getting rid of these hic! things, that's all. Thank you again for everything. I suppose I’ll just sit here and wait for the nice lady to come and take some blood.
DOCTOR: Excellent. That’s perfectly fine. I will leave you to rest for a few minutes, and the phlebotomist will be with you shortly. Please do not hesitate to call out if you need anything at all. We’ll get to the bottom of this, Ms. Sucich. And please, try to relax. I’ll be in touch as soon as the results are available. Have a good day, despite the hiccups.
