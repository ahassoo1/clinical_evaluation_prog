DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Kammer. So, you're here today… tell me what brings you in. Don't spare me the details, but also, try to be concise. My time is valuable, you know.
PATIENT: Well, Doctor... it's a bit silly, really. But my daughter, she thinks I need... a card. A "get well" card. She says I've been... down. I don't feel sick, you understand. Just... old. And tired. But she insists a note from you would... cheer me up. It’s Medicare, so I figured I could ask. Is this something you… do?
DOCTOR: A… a get well card?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. A card. With words. Encouragement, she said. Look, I run the boilers down at the plant, okay? I keep the lights on. I don't need… feelings. But she's my daughter. And she gets… insistent. So, I thought I’d humor her and see if a doctor… a real doctor… would write such a thing. It’s not like I’m asking for pills or anything. Just… a little paper with nice words. Is that so much to ask?
DOCTOR: Mr. Kammer, with all due respect, I am an Internal Medicine physician. I diagnose and treat illnesses. Not… emotional states. While I appreciate your… dedication to keeping the lights on, a “get well” card falls rather outside the scope of my practice. But… let's be practical. Your daughter is concerned. Perhaps there is something bothering you that you haven't addressed. Are you experiencing any… physical symptoms?
PATIENT: Physical symptoms? Doctor, I told you, I run the boilers! It’s hot, it’s loud, it's heavy work. I'm always a little tired. A little sore. That's just… life. I'm 56 years old, not a spring chicken. This isn't about… symptoms. It's about… satisfying a daughter. Look, if you won’t write the card, just say so. I can go back and tell her you're too busy saving lives to worry about a little… paper. But I don't appreciate being made to feel like something’s wrong with me just because I'm a bit weary. Is that clear?
DOCTOR: Very clear, Mr. Kammer. And I assure you, I’m not implying anything is “wrong” with you. However, dismissing fatigue as simply “life” at 56 is… not a particularly sound medical practice. Still, I understand your reluctance. Let's try this. Do you have any complaints beyond general tiredness?
PATIENT: Complaints? Doctor, I complain about the price of coffee, the traffic, the young folks these days… regular complaints. Not… medical complaints. I eat, I sleep, I work. Sometimes my back aches. Sometimes I get a little winded climbing the stairs. But that's just… getting older, right? Is this going somewhere? Because honestly, I've got boilers to oversee. And if this is going to be about listing every little creak and groan, I don't have time for it. I came for a card. Not a full examination.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Kammer. Let’s just cover a few basics. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: Changes? Well, my wife, God rest her soul, she always made a good roast chicken. I haven’t had one like that since… so, yeah, my appetite’s changed. I eat what’s easy. TV dinners mostly. And I probably weigh a bit less, to be honest. Not a lot, but… less. She kept me well-fed. This is getting personal, Doctor. Are you a psychiatrist now? Because if you are, I need a different doctor. I just want a card!
DOCTOR: Mr. Kammer, I am attempting to establish a baseline understanding of your overall health. Weight loss, even modest, can be indicative of underlying issues. Are you experiencing any shortness of breath, even with minimal exertion?
PATIENT: Shortness of breath? Doctor, I work around boilers. It’s hot and steamy! Of course, I get a little winded! It’s not like I’m running marathons. I climb a few flights of stairs at the plant, I walk to the store… normal stuff. Look, I’m a practical man. I deal with pipes and pressure. Not… feelings and shortness of breath. Is this going somewhere useful, or are we just going in circles? I’m starting to think my daughter sent me here just to waste your time, and mine. And frankly, I don’t appreciate it. Just tell me yes or no: will you write the card, or won't you?
DOCTOR: Mr. Kammer, dismissing these symptoms as simply being related to your work is… frankly, irresponsible. While I understand your reluctance, I cannot, in good conscience, simply write a “get well” card without at least ruling out any potential medical concerns. Have you experienced any chest pain, discomfort, or palpitations?
PATIENT: Palpitations? Doctor, are you serious? I’m a boiler operator! I deal with pressure all day. My heart beats! That's what it does. It’s not like I’m having a fancy dance competition. Chest pain? No. Discomfort? Sometimes my back aches, but that’s from lifting things. Look, this is ridiculous. I came here for a simple favor, and I’m getting grilled like a criminal. I’m a healthy man, a working man. I don't need a fancy examination and a list of medical terms. I think I've wasted enough of your time. And mine. No, I don’t have palpitations. No, I don’t have chest pain. Now, can we please just forget this whole thing? I’ll tell my daughter I spoke to you and you were very busy. It’s a white lie, but frankly, I’m at my wit's end. .
DOCTOR: Mr. Kammer, with all due respect, your dismissal of these potential symptoms is concerning. While I appreciate your desire to simply obtain a “get well” card, I am obligated to prioritize your health. I strongly recommend a basic EKG and blood work to rule out any underlying cardiovascular issues. I will not write a card until these tests are completed. It is my professional opinion that doing so would be irresponsible. I can schedule these tests for you today. Or, if you prefer, I can provide you with a referral to another physician. However, I will not proceed without addressing these concerns. .
