DOCTOR: Good morning, Odell. My name is Dr. Seil. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Morning. Yeah, good morning. Uh, travel… something. My wife, she… she booked it. For a trip. I don’t… remember exactly where. She always did the planning. It’s… for shots, I think? Before we go. She said I need shots.
DOCTOR: Alright, Odell. It sounds like your wife scheduled an appointment for you regarding travel vaccinations. That's very thoughtful of her. It’s common to need certain vaccinations or medications before traveling, depending on the destination. To start, could you tell me a little more about where you and your wife are planning to go?
PATIENT: Uhh… no. I really don’t know. She… she didn’t tell me much. Just “pack warm clothes” and “get the needle.” Somewhere… mountains, maybe? Cold place. She liked… fancy places. Not like… here. She always wanted better. I just… followed her around. Honestly, I don't even know when we go. Soon, I guess. Before it gets too… hot?
DOCTOR: Okay, Odell. That’s alright. It sounds like you weren’t involved in the planning process, and that's perfectly fine. We can still figure this out. Before we proceed with any vaccinations, it’s important to understand where you're going so we can determine the appropriate precautions. Do you have any travel documents – a plane ticket, itinerary, or even a confirmation email – that might list the destination?
PATIENT: No… she had everything. All the papers. I… I didn't ask for a copy. She said not to worry my head about it. She liked being in control. I just… I just wanted to make her happy. I don't think she has a copy anymore… not on her person, anyway. She… she passed, you see. A few months back. That’s… why I'm here. She booked this before.
DOCTOR: Oh, Odell. I am so incredibly sorry to hear about your wife. That must be a very difficult time for you. Please, take your time. It's understandable that you're feeling overwhelmed, especially with an appointment like this booked before her passing. So, the trip was arranged by your wife, and you're now needing to fulfill it. That gives us a bit of a puzzle to solve, then. Do you happen to know anything about the trip – even a general region or continent?
PATIENT: Umm… she talked about… Nepal. That’s where we’re from, you know? She wanted to go back. Said it would be good for… for remembering. Her parents… they’re buried there. I think… she wanted to take me to see the mountains. The big ones. Everest, maybe? She always said she wanted to see Everest. But I really don't know. She never explained much, just told me what to do. And… and now she's gone. It's… confusing.
DOCTOR: Nepal. That helps immensely, Odell. Thank you for sharing that. Knowing it's a trip back to Nepal, and potentially the Everest region, gives us a clear starting point. Given the altitude and location, there are several vaccinations and preventative measures we should consider. Before we discuss those, I'd like to gather a bit more information about your medical history. Have you had any vaccinations recently, or do you have a record of your past immunizations?
PATIENT: Umm… no. Not really. I don't go to the doctor much. Never needed to. My wife… she took care of all that. I think… I think I had a shot when I was a little boy, when I first came to this country. But I don’t remember what it was for. She kept all the papers, you know? With everything else. I don’t even know if I need anything. Maybe she already got me poked before… before everything happened. I just… I don't know. It’s all a blur.
DOCTOR: Okay, Odell. It's alright that you don't have that information. We'll proceed as if you haven't had any recent vaccinations, just to be safe. It's always better to err on the side of caution, especially for travel to a region like Nepal. To start, I'd like to ask you some general health questions. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions – like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart disease?
PATIENT: No… nothing like that. I work. Aircraft… putting things together. It’s good work. Hard work. I’m strong. Always been strong. I don’t get sick much. Maybe a cold sometimes. But nothing… serious. My wife… she always said I was a bull. She liked that. Tough. I don't go to the doctor unless I’m… broken. And I haven't been broken in a long time.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, Odell. It sounds like you're generally a very healthy individual. Have you ever had any major surgeries?
PATIENT: No… never. Nothing like that. Just… bumps and bruises from work. Nothing a little rest couldn't fix. I used to help my father with his farm, back in Nepal, but that was a long time ago. Lots of lifting and… things. No doctors needed then, either. Just… strong backs and willing hands. My wife… she worried too much about everything, but I was always fine. Always. Until… until now. It’s just… hard, you know? Everything is just… hard.
DOCTOR: I understand, Odell. It sounds like you've led a very active and healthy life, and I appreciate you sharing that with me. Now, let's talk about medications. Are you currently taking any prescription or over-the-counter medications, including vitamins or supplements?
PATIENT: No. Nothing. My wife… she gave me something for my back sometimes. When I lifted something too heavy. But I haven't taken it in months. It didn't really… do much, anyway. Just… made me sleepy. I don’t like taking pills. Makes me feel… weak. I prefer just… working through it. Tough it out. That’s what my father always said. My wife… she liked me strong. She used to say I was her rock. But now… now I feel like a… like a broken stone. It’s just… everything is so different now.
DOCTOR: Alright, Odell. It sounds like you're generally medication-free, with occasional use of something for back pain. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No. Not that I know of. My wife… she always asked me that before giving me anything. She was very careful. I eat everything. She used to make me try all sorts of new things. Spicy food, different fruits… I didn't always like them, but I always tried. She liked seeing me… enjoy things. I never had a reaction to anything. Never needed to. I just… I just ate whatever she put in front of me. She was always the one who worried about those things. Now… now I don’t even know what I like anymore. Everything just tastes… bland. It’s just… different. Everything is just… different.
DOCTOR: Okay, Odell. Thank you for sharing all of this with me. It sounds like you've been very healthy, generally medication-free, with no known allergies. To get a better picture of your overall health, I'd like to do a brief physical exam. This will involve checking your blood pressure, listening to your heart and lungs, and a quick look at your general condition. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Umm… okay. If you need to. I don’t… I don’t really like doctors. But… if it helps. I don’t want to… cause trouble. My wife… she would want me to. She always said I needed to be careful. She worried too much. But… okay. You can… look at me. Just… be quick, please? I don’t… I don’t do well sitting around. I need to be doing something. Building things. Fixing things. Not… sitting here. It makes me… anxious.
DOCTOR: Of course, Odell. We'll keep it as quick as possible. I understand your discomfort. If at any point you feel uneasy, please let me know, and we can pause or stop. Let's start with your blood pressure. Could you please have a seat here?
PATIENT: Okay… I guess. It’s… cold in here. My wife… she always liked warm places. Said it was better for her bones. I don't know… I just followed her around. Just… do it quickly, please. I… I don't like being touched. Not by strangers. It makes me… uncomfortable. It's just… different now. Everything is just… different.
DOCTOR: I understand, Odell. We'll be as quick and respectful as possible. I'm just going to inflate this cuff for a moment. It will feel a bit tight on your arm, but it shouldn't be painful. Your blood pressure is 130 over 80. That's a little elevated, but not significantly concerning. It could be due to anxiety, or simply the stress of traveling and everything you've been through. Now, I'd like to listen to your heart and lungs. Could you please take a deep breath for me?
PATIENT: Okay… it’s… tight. A little too tight. Is it… almost done? It makes me… feel trapped. My wife… she always said I was a free spirit. She liked that about me. But now… now I feel like a… caged bird. It’s just… different. Everything is just… different.
DOCTOR: Alright, Odell. We're done with that part now. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. I don’t hear any wheezing or crackling. That’s good. I'm just going to gently press on your abdomen now to check for any tenderness. Please let me know if anything feels painful. Does that feel tender anywhere?
PATIENT: Umm… no. Not… really. A little… sore, maybe. But I do a lot of lifting at work. It’s… hard work. Always been hard work. It’s… normal. My wife… she always worried about my back. She used to make me stretch. But I don’t… I don’t really like stretching. It feels… weak. I prefer just… doing it. Building things. Fixing things. It’s… different now. Everything is just… different. Can I… can I go now? I feel… anxious. It's just… a lot.
DOCTOR: Of course, Odell. We're almost finished. I just wanted to check for any obvious tenderness. I'm just going to quickly check your reflexes. This will involve tapping on your knees and ankles. It shouldn't be painful, but it might be a little startling. Your reflexes are normal. Alright, Odell. That completes the physical exam. Everything seems generally okay. Given your history, the travel to Nepal, and the fact that you haven't had recent vaccinations, I recommend a few things to ensure a safe trip. May I share those recommendations with you?
PATIENT: Umm… okay. If you must. But please… be quick about it. I don’t… I don’t like being poked and prodded. It makes me feel… vulnerable. My wife… she always said I was a strong man. She liked that about me. But now… now I feel… broken. Just… tell me what I need to do. I just want to… get this over with. It’s just… different now. Everything is just… different.
DOCTOR: Of course, Odell. I understand. Based on your travel destination—Nepal, particularly if you’re planning on going to higher altitudes—I recommend the following vaccinations: Typhoid, Hepatitis A, and Tetanus-Diphtheria-Pertussis booster if you haven’t had one in the last 10 years. We should also discuss Malaria prophylaxis, as Nepal is a Malaria-risk area. Additionally, I recommend bringing a basic first-aid kit with you, including medications for traveler’s diarrhea, pain relief, and any personal medications you might need. I’d like to schedule you for these vaccinations as soon as possible. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Umm… what? Typhoid? Hepatitis? Malaria? What… what does that even mean? I… I don’t understand. My wife… she always took care of all this. She would explain everything. But now… now I’m just… confused. I… I don’t know. I just want to… go to Nepal. To see my wife’s parents. That’s all. I don’t want to… get poked and prodded with… with things. Can’t I… just go? Without all this… stuff? It’s just… different now. Everything is just… different.
DOCTOR: I understand, Odell. It’s a lot of information, and it’s completely understandable that you're feeling overwhelmed. Let’s break it down. Typhoid and Hepatitis A are vaccinations to protect you from diseases you can contract through contaminated food and water, which are more common in certain parts of Nepal. Malaria is a parasitic disease transmitted by mosquitoes; prophylaxis means taking medication to prevent it. These aren’t things you have to do, but they significantly reduce your risk of getting sick while you’re there. Traveling to Nepal without these precautions isn’t recommended, but ultimately, the decision is yours. However, I strongly advise you consider them, especially given your lack of recent vaccinations and the fact that you’re traveling to a potentially high-risk area. Would you like me to explain each vaccination in more detail?
PATIENT: No… no, please. It’s… too much. It just makes my head hurt. I… I don’t understand medical terms. My wife… she spoke English so well. She would explain everything in simple terms. But now… now I’m just lost. I… I just want to… go to Nepal. To see my wife’s parents. That’s all. I don’t want to… risk getting sick. But I don’t want to… get poked and prodded with… with things either. What… what would you do? If you were me? Just… tell me what you think is best. I… I don’t know what to do anymore. It’s just… different now. Everything is just… different.
DOCTOR: Odell, given your situation—your recent loss, the fact that you weren't involved in travel planning, and your lack of recent vaccinations—if I were in your shoes, I would prioritize protecting your health. Traveling to Nepal, especially at higher altitudes, carries certain risks, and I would want to minimize those as much as possible. Therefore, I would recommend getting the Typhoid, Hepatitis A, and Tdap vaccinations. I would also recommend discussing Malaria prophylaxis with me and considering taking medication to prevent it. However, I understand your reluctance, and I won't force you to do anything you're not comfortable with. We can also discuss alternative options, such as taking extra precautions with food and water and being vigilant about mosquito bites. Ultimately, the decision is yours, and I'm here to support you in whatever you choose. Would you like me to schedule you for these vaccinations, or would you prefer to discuss alternative options?
PATIENT: ...Okay. Fine. Just… get it over with. Do what you think is best. I… I don’t want to make any decisions. I don’t want to… think about it anymore. Just… schedule the things. Whatever they are. Typhoid, Hepatitis… whatever. Just… get it over with. I… I trust you. I… I just want to… go to Nepal. And… and come back. Just… get it over with. Please. It’s just… different now. Everything is just… different.
DOCTOR: Alright, Odell. I understand. We’ll schedule you for the Typhoid, Hepatitis A, and Tdap vaccinations. We'll also discuss Malaria prophylaxis and determine the best course of action for you. I’ll have the nurse come in shortly to administer the vaccinations. She’ll explain the process and address any concerns you may have. Please know that you can stop at any time if you feel uncomfortable. Is there anything else I can do for you at this time?
PATIENT: No… no, thank you. I… I just want to go home. And… and try to forget about all this. It’s… too much. Just… let me go home. Please. I… I just want to… rest. It’s just… different now. Everything is just… different.
DOCTOR: Of course, Odell. You've been through a lot today. I’ll have the nurse come in to finish up, and then you’re free to go home and rest. Here's a printed summary of the vaccinations we’ve discussed, and some information on travel health. Feel free to call the clinic if you have any questions or concerns later on. Take care of yourself, Odell. And safe travels.
PATIENT: .
