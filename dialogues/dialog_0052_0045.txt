DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Withycombe. My name is Dr. Patricia Shely. It’s a pleasure to meet you. I see here you are new to the clinic. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Shely. Nice to meet you too. Yes, I am new. Um… it’s my face. It gets… red. Like, flushing. Happens sometimes. Not always, you know?
DOCTOR: Thank you for explaining that, Mr. Withycombe. It sounds concerning. When you say “flushing,” could you describe what that feels like?
PATIENT: Feels… warm. Very warm. Starts on my cheeks, then maybe my neck. Like… when you’re embarrassed, but I’m not always embarrassed. Sometimes it happens when I eat, sometimes when I… well, I don't know. It just happens. It doesn’t hurt, just… noticeable. People look.
DOCTOR: I understand. So, the redness and warmth begin on your cheeks and neck, and it occurs sporadically – sometimes with eating, sometimes seemingly without a clear trigger. And it’s bothersome because it attracts attention. To get a clearer picture, could you tell me about how long this has been happening?
PATIENT: Oh, a long time. Maybe… five years? Six? Hard to say exactly. It started slow. Just a little color. Now… it’s more. I thought it was just me getting older, you know? But it keeps happening. And… well, my wife, she… she noticed it too, before she… passed. She said I looked… stressed. But I wasn’t always stressed.
DOCTOR: I’m very sorry to hear about your wife, Mr. Withycombe. That must be incredibly difficult. It’s good you’ve brought this to my attention now, regardless of how long it’s been going on. Five or six years is a significant period, and we want to investigate what could be causing this. To help me understand further, are there any other symptoms that occur with the flushing?
PATIENT: Symptoms… hmm. Let me think. Sometimes… my heart beats a little fast. Not like… racing, but faster than normal. And… sometimes I feel a little dizzy. Just for a moment. It goes away quick. And… oh! And I get… sweaty. A little. Just on my face. That’s it, I think. Nothing else. Usually. It's hard to remember everything. It’s just… the red face is the main thing.
DOCTOR: Thank you for detailing that, Mr. Withycombe. So, with the flushing you sometimes experience a faster heartbeat, brief dizziness, and mild sweating on your face. That’s helpful information. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Do you have any pre-existing medical conditions that you're aware of, such as high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing like that. I’ve always been… healthy. I eat okay, I walk a little. The doctor… my old doctor… he always said my blood pressure was good. No sugar problems either. Never had any heart trouble. That’s why this is so strange. I don't take any pills, nothing. Just… this flushing. And it worries me.
DOCTOR: That's good to know, Mr. Withycombe. No pre-existing conditions and no current medications. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No, never. Not even for my tonsils when I was a boy. I… I've been very lucky, I think. Always just a little cold here and there. Nothing serious. I avoid hospitals if I can. They… they make me nervous. This is all very strange. I'm usually a very calm person. This flushing… it doesn't feel like me.
DOCTOR: I understand your reluctance towards hospitals, Mr. Withycombe, and I appreciate you sharing that. It's good to hear you've generally been healthy. Now, could you tell me about your family history?
PATIENT: Hmm. Family history… my mother, she had… problems with her stomach. Always upset. But not… flushing. My father, he was strong. Never sick. My sister, she had… headaches, bad ones. But nothing like this. Nobody in my family… red face. As far as I know. We didn’t talk much about… health problems. It wasn't something we did. I don’t know if that helps.
DOCTOR: That's alright, Mr. Withycombe. Any information is helpful. So, no known family history of similar symptoms. Now, let's briefly discuss your lifestyle. Do you smoke or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never smoked a cigarette in my life. And I don’t drink. Not even a beer. My wife… she didn’t like it. And I… I didn’t want to upset her. So, no smoking, no drinking. I drink tea, sometimes. And water. That’s it. A simple life, really. Just… this red face. It’s ruining everything. I used to enjoy going out, but now… I worry people will stare.
DOCTOR: Thank you for being so open with me, Mr. Withycombe. So, no smoking, no alcohol. Now, regarding allergies, do you have any known allergies to medications, foods, or environmental factors?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing. I can eat anything. I've never had a bad reaction to anything. Bees, pollen, dust… nothing bothers me. I used to garden, you know? Lots of pollen. Never had a problem. I really don’t think I'm allergic to anything. It's just… this flushing. It's very frustrating. I've tried everything. Cold water, staying inside… nothing seems to help.
DOCTOR: That's good to know, Mr. Withycombe. No known allergies. Now, before we proceed to a physical exam, is there anything else you think might be relevant?
PATIENT: Um… well… I’ve been a little… lonely since my wife passed. A lot of time on my own. Maybe that’s it? Stress? But I don't feel stressed. Just… empty. And this flushing… it started around the same time. Could that be it? I don’t know. It just feels… wrong. I’ve been trying to keep busy, but it's hard. It's just me, you know? And this red face. It’s a constant reminder.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Withycombe. The loss of your wife is a significant life event, and it’s perfectly understandable that you’re feeling lonely and experiencing emotional changes. It's possible those feelings are contributing to your symptoms. We’ll keep that in mind. Now, if you’re comfortable, I’d like to perform a brief physical exam to get a better understanding of what’s going on. I’ll check your blood pressure, heart rate, and examine your skin. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That’s… that’s fine. Whatever you think is best. I just want to know what’s happening. I just want to feel… normal again. Blood pressure, heart rate… go ahead. I’m ready. Though… please be gentle. I'm a little… sensitive.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Withycombe. I will be as gentle as possible. Your blood pressure is 138/82, which is slightly elevated, but not significantly. Your heart rate is 88 beats per minute, which is within the normal range. Your pulse is regular. I notice some mild redness on your cheeks and neck. Your skin feels warm to the touch in those areas, but there are no visible rashes or lesions. There’s no obvious textural change. Your lymph nodes feel normal – no swelling or tenderness detected. Your eyes and mouth appear normal. Now, I’d like to ask you a few more questions, if you don't mind. Have you noticed any triggers that seem to worsen the flushing – certain foods, drinks, activities, or emotional states?
PATIENT: Triggers… hmm. That’s a hard one. Sometimes it happens after I eat… spicy food, maybe? But not always. And sometimes it happens when I’m just… sitting. Relaxing. It seems random. I did notice it happened a few times when I was visiting my daughter. She… she has a lot of people over. Loud noises, lots of talking. Maybe stress? But I wasn't feeling stressed. Just… overwhelmed, I guess. And… and once it happened when I was looking at old photographs of my wife. Just… a sudden wave of sadness. So, maybe… food, noise, sadness. It's all very confusing. I'm not sure. It doesn't make any sense.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Withycombe. That’s helpful information. Spicy food, social situations, and emotional triggers like sadness seem to be associated with the flushing. Given your symptoms – intermittent flushing, faster heartbeat, brief dizziness, mild sweating, and potential triggers like food, noise, and emotional states – along with your slightly elevated blood pressure, there are a few possibilities we need to consider. One possibility is rosacea, a common skin condition that can cause facial redness and flushing. However, your symptoms don’t entirely fit the typical presentation of rosacea, and there's no rash or other visible skin changes. Another possibility is a condition called vasomotor flushing, which involves sudden changes in blood vessel dilation and constriction, often triggered by emotional or environmental factors. Less commonly, it could be related to underlying conditions like hyperthyroidism or certain medications, but you've reported no current medications and your thyroid feels normal to palpation. To get a clearer diagnosis, I would like to order some blood tests. These will help rule out any underlying medical conditions like hyperthyroidism, and will also give us some more information about your overall health. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Blood tests… yes, Doctor. That sounds… good. If it helps figure out what’s happening, then yes. I just want to know what’s wrong. I’m tired of feeling this way. I'm not afraid of a little blood. Just… let me know what I need to do. Where do I go? And… how long will it take to get the results? I have to go help my daughter next week, and I want to make sure I’m… okay.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Withycombe. I understand your desire for answers, and I will do my best to help you find them. I’m going to order a complete blood count , a comprehensive metabolic panel , and a thyroid-stimulating hormone test. The CBC will check for any abnormalities in your blood cells, the CMP will assess your kidney and liver function, and the TSH test will evaluate your thyroid function. You can go to the lab at County General Hospital. They’re located at 123 Main Street. You don’t need an appointment. Just bring this requisition form with you. They’re open Monday through Friday from 7 AM to 5 PM. The results should be available in about 3 to 5 business days. I’ll give you a call as soon as they come back. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding known triggers like spicy foods and stressful situations as much as possible. Staying hydrated and getting adequate rest can also help. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think… I think that’s everything. Thank you. Thank you for listening. It helps just… talking about it. I’ll go to the lab tomorrow. And I'll try to avoid the spicy food. Though my daughter makes a wonderful curry… Maybe I’ll just skip it this time. Thank you again. I appreciate your help.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Withycombe. I'm glad I could help, and I encourage you to reach out if you have any concerns before your follow-up appointment. I wish you all the best, and I’ll be in touch as soon as your lab results are available. Have a good day, Mr. Withycombe.
