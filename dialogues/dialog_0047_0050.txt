DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Pavlovic. I’m Dr. Press. Now, you’re 90 years young, which is wonderful. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. It's… well, it’s this cough. Been bothering me for a while now. A dry cough, you see. Not much… not much to it, really. Just… dry. It’s tiring, more than anything. I forget how long it’s been, though. A good long while, I think.
DOCTOR: A long while… right. And is it constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Comes and goes, I suppose. Mostly… mostly when I lay down, I think. Or when the air is… chilly. Like this morning, it was pretty bad when I first woke up. But it fades… mostly. It's just… always there, somewhere in the back of my throat. Does that make sense? I'm not very good at explaining things, I’m afraid.
DOCTOR: So, worse when lying down, and with cooler air… that’s helpful. Any other symptoms along with the cough?
PATIENT: Hmm… other symptoms. Let me think… Well, I get a little… winded, easier than I used to, if I walk too far. But I’m 90, so that’s probably just… old age, right? I don't know if that counts as a symptom. And sometimes… sometimes my chest feels a little tight. But not always. Mostly when I’m coughing, I guess. It's hard to say what comes first, the cough or the tightness.
DOCTOR: Alright. Shortness of breath with exertion, and some chest tightness coinciding with the cough. Have you noticed any fever, chills, or night sweats?
PATIENT: Fever… oh, goodness. I don't think so. I haven’t taken my temperature in… well, a very long time. My wife used to take care of that. And chills… not really. Maybe a little cold sometimes, but that's just… the weather. Night sweats… I don’t think so. I sleep pretty soundly, actually. I wake up… a little damp sometimes, but that's probably just the blankets. I’m an old man, you know. I get warm easily.
DOCTOR: Right, right. No fever, chills, or night sweats reported. Any wheezing or any pain when you cough?
PATIENT: Wheezing… is that like a whistling sound? I don't think so. No whistling. And pain… not really pain. Just… uncomfortable. Like a tickle, almost. It makes me want to cough more, if that makes sense. Not a sharp pain, just… annoying. My chest feels… sore sometimes after a lot of coughing, but not during.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, no wheezing, no pain with the cough, just some soreness afterwards. Now, have you ever smoked, or been exposed to a lot of dust or fumes?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Smoking… no, never. My wife wouldn’t allow it. She was a strong woman, my wife. As for dust and fumes… well, I used to work on cars. Automotive repair, you see. Lots of dust and… things. Oil, paint… all sorts of things. That was a long time ago, though. Decades ago. I haven't done that work in… well, a long time.
DOCTOR: Automotive repair… right. And how about your general health?
PATIENT: Oh, my general health… well, I'm 90, Doctor. What do you expect? I get tired easily. My bones ache a little, especially when it rains. I don't move around as much as I used to. But I eat… I eat okay, I think. My daughter brings me food sometimes. She worries about me. I try to stay active, but… it’s hard. I don't get sick often, though. Just this cough. And… sometimes my memory isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications, or have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions – like heart problems, lung disease, or diabetes?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Medications… let me think. Just a little something for my… blood pressure, I think. A small white pill. My daughter fills it for me, so I don’t really pay attention. As for medical conditions… well, the doctor said something about my heart a few years back, but I don’t remember exactly what. Something about… a little flutter, maybe? I don't have diabetes, I’m pretty sure. My wife always made sure I didn't eat too much sugar.
DOCTOR: Right. A medication for blood pressure, and some sort of heart issue in the past. Do you know the name of the blood pressure medication?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Now you’re asking something I truly don’t know. I just take the pill every morning, that’s all. It’s small and white… and my daughter orders it. I don't bother her with the details, she has enough to worry about. I'm afraid I'm not very good at remembering things like that.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, let's have a listen to your lungs. Could you please sit up straight and take a deep breath for me?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. A listen to my lungs, you say? Yes, yes, I can do that. Deep breath… like this?
DOCTOR: Alright. Take another deep breath… and exhale slowly. Hmm. I do hear some… diminished breath sounds, especially in the lower lobes. And a few… scattered crackles. Do you feel any pain when I press here?
PATIENT: Oh, diminished breath sounds… that doesn’t sound good, does it? Scattered crackles… Ooh, a little bit, yes. There. On the left side. Not sharp pain, just… uncomfortable. Like a little ache. It’s been that way for a while, I think. Not constant, just… when someone presses.
DOCTOR: Alright. Given your age, the history of automotive repair, the diminished breath sounds, and the crackles I’m hearing, I suspect this could be chronic bronchitis, possibly with some underlying emphysema. It’s likely exacerbated by the cough. We'll need to rule out pneumonia, of course. I’m going to order a chest X-ray and a sputum culture. We’ll also check your oxygen saturation. In the meantime, I recommend you stay well-hydrated and avoid any irritants like smoke or dust. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Chronic bronchitis… emphysema… those sound like very serious things. Pneumonia… oh dear. An X-ray… a sputum culture… that sounds… involved. Allergies… hmm. Let me think. Not that I know of. My wife always said I was pretty hardy. No, I don’t think I’ve ever had an allergic reaction to anything. But… like I said, my memory isn’t what it used to be. Is it bad, Doctor? Is it very bad?
DOCTOR: It’s not necessarily “bad,” Mr. Pavlovic, but it’s important to understand what’s going on. These conditions are common in people with a history of smoking or exposure to irritants, and can cause shortness of breath and frequent coughing. The X-ray will help us see if there's any evidence of pneumonia or other lung problems. We need that information to determine the best course of treatment. I’m going to write you a referral to the lab for the tests, and to radiology for the X-ray. My nurse will go over the instructions with you before you leave. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. So, tests… and a picture of my lungs. Yes, I think I understand. It’s good to know what’s going on, I suppose. Even if it’s not good news. My daughter will be glad to hear we’re getting it checked out. She worries about me so much. Will I be able to… will I be able to go home afterward?
DOCTOR: Yes, you’ll be able to go home afterward, Mr. Pavlovic. These tests are non-invasive. We’ll review the results when they come back, and then we can discuss a treatment plan. I’m going to prescribe you a bronchodilator inhaler to help open up your airways and ease your breathing. My nurse will explain how to use it. Do you have any questions for me right now before I have my nurse come in?
PATIENT: A bronchodilator… inhaler… that sounds complicated. Will it… will it make me sleepy? I don't like being sleepy. And… will it interact with my blood pressure medicine? That’s the small white pill. My daughter orders it. I just… I don't want any surprises.
DOCTOR: The inhaler shouldn’t make you sleepy, Mr. Pavlovic. And it's unlikely to interact with your blood pressure medication, but it’s always best to be cautious. My nurse will review all your medications and make sure there are no contraindications. She’ll also show you exactly how to use the inhaler, and we'll monitor you closely. Let's not get ahead of ourselves. We need the test results first. Do you have any other questions at this moment?
PATIENT: Oh… alright. No… I don't think so. Not at this moment. Just… please tell my daughter everything. She’s very good at understanding these things. And… thank you, Doctor. For… for everything.
DOCTOR: Alright. I will make sure she’s fully informed. My nurse will be in shortly with the instructions and referrals. Have a good day, Mr. Pavlovic. .
PATIENT: Oh… you too, Doctor.
