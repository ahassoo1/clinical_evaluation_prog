DOCTOR: Good morning, Mrs. Abdollahi. I’m Dr. Press. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. My… how you say… the place for old people? My son, he want me to go there. He say I need paper from you, to say I okay. He worry too much, maybe. But I here now.
DOCTOR: Right. A… facility, you mean. And he needs a medical evaluation for you to be admitted, just to confirm your overall health. I understand. So, let's go through a few things to get a better picture. First, can you tell me a little bit about why you think you might benefit from staying at a facility?
PATIENT: Hmm… benefit? I no sure. I live with my husband, you know? We have house. But… he get older too. He… hard to cook now, and clean. Maybe… it make things easier for both of us? I not so strong like before. Little things… hard. I like my house, though. Very much.
DOCTOR: Alright, I see. So, it sounds like some of the daily tasks are becoming a little more challenging. Things like cooking and cleaning, you mentioned. And your husband is finding those tasks difficult as well. Let's talk about those "little things" a bit more specifically. Are you having trouble with bathing, dressing, or getting around the house?
PATIENT: No… no trouble with them. Just… slower. Very much slower. And sometimes… I forget where I put things. My glasses, for example! I had them just now…
DOCTOR: Yes, well, everyone misplaces things from time to time. Now, besides the difficulty with daily tasks and a little forgetfulness, are you experiencing any other changes?
PATIENT: Changes? Like… what kind of changes? I eat, I sleep… mostly. Sometimes my knees hurt, when rain come. And… Sometimes… I feel… sad. Not all the time, just… sometimes. When I think about my life, you know? It long life. Lots of things happen.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, some knee pain with the weather, and occasional feelings of sadness. Has anything specific happened that’s been making you feel sad?
PATIENT: No… not specific. Just… old. Friends… they go away, you know? And my son… he live far. I not see him so much. I worry about him, too. He work very hard. It make me sad. But he good son. Very good. He want best for me. That is why he bring me here.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, it’s completely understandable to feel that way. Changes in life circumstances and losing friends can be very difficult. Now, let's go over some medical history, if you don't mind. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Hmmm… medical? The doctor… back in Honduras… he say my blood pressure little high, many years ago. He give me pills. I take them for a while. But then I come to America, and… I not see that doctor anymore. And here… the doctors… they change so much. I forget which one say what. I think… my heart okay. Mostly.
DOCTOR: Alright, a history of high blood pressure. And you're saying it hasn't been consistently managed since you moved to the United States?
PATIENT: No… not consistent. I try to take pills sometimes, but… I forget. Or I run out. My son, he buy them when he visit. But he busy, you know? So… sometimes I just… not take them. Is okay, though. I feel okay. Most days.
DOCTOR: Right. And do you have any allergies to medications, or anything else, for that matter?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. I eat everything. Mango, papaya, fish… I like everything. No allergies. My mother, she allergic to dust. But me, no. I strong girl. Mostly.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any other medications or supplements, besides the occasional blood pressure pills?
PATIENT: Hmmm… Sometimes I take… a little something for my knees, when they hurt bad. The lady at the store… she say it good. With ginger, I think. And… sometimes I drink chamomile tea, before bed. Is help me sleep. But that is all. No pills… regular. Just the little things.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, let's do a quick physical exam to get a better understanding of things. Can you stand up for me, please?
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. Old bones… they not move so fast. Is little creaky.
DOCTOR: Yes, I see. Just take your time. Now, can you walk a few steps for me?
PATIENT: Like this? Is okay? My husband… he say I walk a little funny now. But I not fall! Not yet, anyway.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s good. Just be careful. Now, let’s check your blood pressure. 150 over 88. A little elevated. And your pulse is 76. Regular. Let me listen to your heart and lungs now. Breath sounds are a little diminished in the bases, but clear. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs.
PATIENT: Elevated? That is bad? My husband… he always worry about my pressure. He say I eat too much salt. But I like salt! And… my lungs? What is diminished? Is something wrong?
DOCTOR: It’s not necessarily bad, but it's something we need to be aware of. It simply means your heart is working a little harder than it should. And diminished breath sounds… it just means that the air isn’t moving as freely through your lungs as it could be. It's not an emergency, but it’s something we should investigate further. Now, let’s check your reflexes.
PATIENT: Oh! That is cold! My husband, he do that too, when I go to the doctor. He always try to be helpful. But I think he like it when they poke me. Is silly, maybe? Are my reflexes okay? Is something wrong with my legs?
DOCTOR: They're… adequate. It just means your nerves are responding normally. Now, before we wrap up, do you have any questions for me?
PATIENT: Questions… hmm. Will I… will I like it there? At the place? My house… I like my house. Is cozy. Will I be lonely? And… will my son visit me? He busy, you know. That is my biggest worry. Is he visit?
DOCTOR: Those are very valid concerns, Mrs. Abdollahi. As for whether you'll like it there, it depends. It’s a community, and they have activities. As for your son visiting, that's something you should discuss with him. I can certainly write a note to him expressing your concerns. Ultimately, it’s up to him to make time. Based on what we’ve discussed today, I recommend a short stay to start, to see how you adjust. We can reassess after a week. I’ll order some basic blood work to get a better understanding of your overall health and rule out any underlying issues. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: A week… okay. A week is not so long. And you write note to my son? That would be good. He listen to you, maybe. You… you doctor. He respect doctors. And the blood work… is important? Is something wrong? I not want anything wrong. I just want to be okay.
DOCTOR: The blood work is just a precaution, Mrs. Abdollahi. It helps us get a clearer picture of your health and ensure there aren't any underlying issues contributing to your symptoms. It doesn’t necessarily mean anything is wrong. I'll write a note to your son, expressing your concerns about visits and your overall adjustment to the facility. Now, I’ll have the nurse draw the blood, and we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment in a week to discuss the results. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms, please don't hesitate to contact the facility’s medical staff. .
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. Thank you. I hope… I hope everything will be okay. . .
