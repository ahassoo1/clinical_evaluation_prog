DOCTOR: Right. Mr. Rowbottom, is it?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. Arbie Rowbottom. And don’t you forget it. I don’t appreciate being called the wrong name. It’s happened too much lately.
DOCTOR: Yes, well. Let’s try to stay focused, shall we?
PATIENT: Focused? You try being focused when you’re… well, never mind. It’s personal. Look, I came in about… something in my stool. Blood. Not a good sign, is it? Though I doubt you would know anything about real problems.
DOCTOR: Blood in the stool is… certainly something we need to discuss. How long has this been happening, Mr. Rowbottom?
PATIENT: Oh, a couple of days now, maybe three. Hard to say, really. I don’t spend that much time looking at it, if you get my meaning. But it was definitely there this morning. Bright red, it was. Not just a little streak, either. More than a little. And it’s concerning, naturally. Though I suspect it’s nothing serious. Probably just… something I ate.
DOCTOR: "Bright red" can indicate a few things. And while dietary causes are possible, we shouldn’t dismiss it. Have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits alongside this?
PATIENT: Changes? Well, I'm 88 years old! Everything changes. What do you expect? But… let me think. No, not really. Same as usual, mostly. A bit… loose, perhaps, yesterday. But that could be the coffee. I like a strong cup, you see. Keeps me regular, usually. Though maybe too regular, now that I think about it. It's a delicate balance, you understand.
DOCTOR: Right. And any abdominal pain, nausea, or feeling weak?
PATIENT: Weak? Well, yes, a little. Aren't we all, at my age? But not… crippling weak. Just… tired. And a bit of a stomach rumble now and then. Nothing to write home about, honestly. I’ve had worse after a bad oyster. And no nausea, thankfully. I hate being sick. It's undignified. Though, thinking about it... my appetite hasn't been what it used to be. Not that I need a huge appetite, mind you. A few bites is enough these days.
DOCTOR: Okay. Let’s take a look at your chart. I see you’ve had… minimal recent medical care. Do you have any known allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? Goodness, no. I’m a hardy stock, me. Haida, you know. We don’t get sick easily. Though, my ex-wife swore I was allergic to common sense. But that’s a different story. As for medication… I took some aspirin for my knee a few years back, but that was ages ago. No ill effects, as far as I recall. Why, is that important? You’re starting to worry me, young lady. Is it something serious?
DOCTOR: It's standard procedure, Mr. Rowbottom. Now, if you'll excuse me, I'd like to perform a brief physical exam. Just to get a better understanding of things. Please lie down on the examination table.
PATIENT: A physical exam? At my age? Honestly. What are you looking for? I’ll tell you what, I’ve lived a long life. If something’s wrong, it’ll show. I don't need you poking and prodding. But… fine. If you insist. Just be gentle, alright? And no cold instruments, if you please.
DOCTOR: Alright. Just relax. I’m just checking for tenderness. Any pain here?
PATIENT: Oof! There, yes! That’s a bit… sensitive. Right about there. Not a sharp pain, mind you, more of a dull ache. Like a bruise, almost. You're pressing a bit hard, aren't you? Is that necessary? Honestly, you young doctors, always so rough with us old folks. I used to be able to take a punch, you know.
DOCTOR: Right. And any recent weight loss, Mr. Rowbottom?
PATIENT: Weight loss? Well, now that you mention it… my clothes have been a little looser. Not that I’m complaining. Makes getting dressed easier, to be sure. But yes, I suppose I’ve lost a few pounds. Maybe five or ten? Hard to say, really. I don’t weigh myself regularly. What's the point? It’s just a number. But my daughter keeps telling me I'm looking thin. She worries too much. Always has.
DOCTOR: Okay. Given your age, the blood in your stool, and the tenderness in your abdomen, I think we need to run a few tests. A complete blood count, a stool sample to check for infection and blood, and potentially a colonoscopy.
PATIENT: A colonoscopy?! Now hold on just a minute! You want to… look where? Absolutely not. I’ve heard stories about those things. Invasive, humiliating… I will not be subjected to such indignity. And all these tests… what’s the point? I’m 88 years old! I’ve had a good life. Let nature take its course, I say. You’re making a mountain out of a molehill, young lady. I’m perfectly fine. Just a bit of indigestion, that’s all! .
DOCTOR: Mr. Rowbottom, I understand your concerns, but ignoring these symptoms could be dangerous. While a natural decline is expected with age, it’s crucial to rule out serious conditions like colon cancer. I strongly recommend the colonoscopy. If you refuse, I can refer you to a gastroenterologist for a second opinion. But I'm obligated to advise you that this is the most responsible course of action. .
