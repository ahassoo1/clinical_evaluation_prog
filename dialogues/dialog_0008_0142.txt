DOCTOR: Good morning, Jaxston. I'm Dr. Cumper. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Uh, good morning, Doc. Right, well… it's my head. Been getting these headaches, pretty bad ones. And I get all sweaty when they hit, and my heart kinda… races, I guess. It's been happening on and off for a bit now. Honestly, I can't really say how long, it just feels like a while.
DOCTOR: Okay, headaches with sweating and a racing heart. That’s good information to start with. When you say "a while," can you give me a rough estimate?
PATIENT: Rough estimate… hmm. Maybe… a few months? It's hard to say for sure, things kinda blur together. Definitely not just a couple of days, though. It feels like it’s been dragging on for a bit. I don't really keep track of dates much, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Alright, a few months. And can you describe the headaches themselves?
PATIENT: Uh, they're… just really bad. Like a pounding, all over my head. Sometimes it feels like a tight band squeezing, other times it's more like… everything's throbbing. It's hard to explain. And it’s usually on both sides, I don’t think it’s ever just been one side. They make it hard to think, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, pounding, throbbing, both sides of the head, and making it difficult to concentrate. Are there any specific things that seem to trigger these headaches?
PATIENT: Trigger… that’s a good question. Not really, not that I’ve noticed. They just… happen. Sometimes when I'm tired, maybe? But even when I get enough sleep, they can still show up. I used to think it was the work, but it happens on my days off too. Honestly, I'm drawing a blank. It feels pretty random.
DOCTOR: Alright, seems fairly random. Do you notice anything else happening with the headaches besides the sweating and racing heart?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Sometimes I feel kinda nauseous, like I'm gonna be sick, but I haven't actually been sick. And things seem… brighter, I guess? Like light bothers me more when I have one. And I get really thirsty. That’s about it, I think. Not much else.
DOCTOR: Okay, nausea, light sensitivity, and increased thirst. And when you say light bothers you, is that like a specific type of light, or just generally?
PATIENT: Just generally, I think. Like, even normal room light feels really harsh when I've got a headache. Sun's definitely worse, but even inside it’s bad. It’s not like it hurts my eyes, more just… uncomfortable, really. Makes the headache feel worse, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, light sensitivity with the headache. Have you noticed any changes in your vision at all?
PATIENT: Changes in my vision… Not that I’ve noticed, no. Everything seems pretty normal, as far as I can tell. I don’t wear glasses, haven't needed ‘em before. I guess I haven’t really looked closely, if that makes sense? I just see things, y’know?
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any other medical problems that you know of?
PATIENT: Hmm… Not really. I mean, I got divorced a few years back, if that counts as a problem. But physically… no. No big illnesses or anything. I haven’t been to the doctor in ages, to be honest. Don’t really like going, if I can avoid it. I don't have insurance either, so… it's not easy.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known medical problems, and no recent doctor visits. Any family history of headaches or migraines, or any other serious medical conditions?
PATIENT: Family history… My mother used to get headaches sometimes, but she just took some pills and got on with it. Nothing major, as far as I know. My dad… he had a bad heart, I think, but he died a long time ago. And I don’t really keep in touch with my siblings, so I wouldn’t know what they’ve got going on. Sorry, I’m not much help on that front.
DOCTOR: Okay. Do you currently take any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Nah, not really. I might take a painkiller if a headache gets really bad, like ibuprofen or something, but that’s it. Nothing regular. And no supplements, vitamins, anything like that. Just… painkillers when I need 'em, and that’s about it. I don’t like taking pills if I can avoid it, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Alright. And finally, do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Uh… I used to drink, a bit. But not really anymore. Not since the divorce, it just… didn't seem right. Never smoked, and definitely no recreational drugs. Never been into any of that. Just trying to keep things simple, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. Alright, Jaxston. So, we've got recurring headaches for a few months, with sweating, racing heart, nausea, and sensitivity to light. No known medical conditions, no medications, and you've stopped drinking alcohol. Now, I'm going to do a quick physical exam, just to rule out anything obvious. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s fine. Sounds good, Doc. Just let me know if you need me to do anything. Happy to help.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’m going to check your reflexes now. Just relax your arm… good. And now your leg… good. Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light. Motor strength appears normal in all extremities. Blood pressure is 130/80. Temporal arteries feel normal. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Take a deep breath for me… good. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear. Finally, I’m going to check your neck for stiffness. No significant stiffness noted. So, the physical exam doesn’t reveal any immediate red flags. However, given the recurring headaches, sweating, and racing heart, I’m concerned about a few possibilities. These could be tension headaches, migraines, or even something more serious. I think it would be best to get some blood work done, just to rule out any underlying medical conditions. And, given the nature of these headaches, I would recommend a CT scan of your head, just to be on the safe side. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Uh… CT scan sounds a bit scary. Blood work, yeah, that’s fine. But a scan… is it necessary? What are we looking for exactly? And… how much will all this cost? I don't have insurance, like I said. It's just… money’s tight.
DOCTOR: You're right to ask those questions, Jaxston. It's perfectly reasonable to be concerned. A CT scan isn't something I take lightly. It does involve radiation exposure, although it’s a small dose. We're looking to rule out any structural issues, like an aneurysm or a tumor, which are rare, but important to exclude given your symptoms. The blood work will check for things like infection, inflammation, and electrolyte imbalances. It’s less expensive than the CT scan. I understand your concern about the cost, especially without insurance. Let me see what the estimated costs are for both tests. Okay, the blood work will be approximately $150, and the CT scan is around $800-$1200 depending on whether contrast dye is needed. We can start with the blood work, and then, depending on the results, we can discuss whether or not to proceed with the CT scan. We can also explore options for financial assistance. Many hospitals have programs to help patients who are uninsured. I can put you in touch with the financial counselor here at the clinic. How does that sound?
PATIENT: $800-$1200… wow. That's… a lot. Okay, yeah, let's definitely just start with the blood work then. And please, please could you put me in touch with the financial counselor? I really appreciate that. I just… don’t know where I’d get that kind of money. What do I need to do for the blood work? Do I need to fast beforehand?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Jaxston. We’ll start with the blood work, and we’ll figure out the financial aspect. I’ll get you the financial counselor's contact information before you leave. Yes, for the blood work, you will need to fast for at least 8 hours beforehand. That means no food or drinks, except water. You can drink water. We’ll draw the blood here at the clinic. The lab technician will give you specific instructions, but generally, it's a quick process. I’ll write you a lab order now. Take this to the lab down the hall. They’re open until 5 pm today. Once the results are back, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. Typically, it takes 24-48 hours for the results to come back. Do you have any questions about the blood work or the follow-up process?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s pretty clear. 8 hours fast, take this to the lab, and then come back for a follow-up. Thank you, Doc. I really appreciate you explaining everything. And for the help with the financial stuff. It's a weight off my shoulders, honestly. I guess I’ll go get this done then. .
DOCTOR: Alright, Jaxston. You're very welcome. Please don’t hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up. Take care, and I’ll see you soon.
