DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Durig. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Quicksey. It’s nice to meet you. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh… good morning, Doctor. It’s… nice to meet you as well. Well, to be frank, I’m not entirely sure why I’m here. Something about… my skin? It’s yellowing, I believe. A young man at the hospital mentioned something about the liver, but… my memory isn’t what it once was. I apologize for the confusion.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Durig. It’s common for things to be a bit unclear, and we’ll figure it out together. Yellowing of the skin, you said. That's called jaundice, and it can be related to liver issues, but there are other possibilities as well. To help me understand what's going on, could you tell me when you first noticed the yellowing?
PATIENT: Oh… jaundice, is it? Yes, that sounds right. When did I first notice… goodness. It feels like… a few weeks, perhaps? It started subtly, and I just thought it was the lighting in my apartment. Then my neighbor, Mrs. Henderson, pointed it out. She’s very observant, that one. It’s been getting worse since then, I suppose. It’s hard to say exactly when, though. Time… it slips away, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Ms. Durig. It's easy for time to slip away. So, a few weeks, gradually worsening. Has the yellowing been anywhere specific, or is it all over?
PATIENT: Well… it seems to be mostly in my eyes, I think. And… my skin, of course. It’s hard to tell, truly. It’s all a bit… washed out, isn’t it? I haven’t been out much lately, so I haven’t really seen myself clearly. Perhaps it’s all over, I just… don’t know. I apologize for being so vague.
DOCTOR: You’re not being vague at all, Ms. Durig. It’s helpful to know it’s noticeable in your eyes and skin. And it’s perfectly reasonable that you haven't been able to assess it closely if you haven’t been out much. Now, aside from the yellowing, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms… oh dear. Let me think. I’ve been… rather tired lately. More so than usual. And my stomach… it hasn’t been quite right. A bit of discomfort, you know? Not pain, exactly. Just… unsettled. And I’ve lost my appetite, I suppose. Everything tastes… bland. But that could just be old age.
DOCTOR: Okay, fatigue, some stomach discomfort, and loss of appetite. Those are all things we should investigate. Has the stomach discomfort been constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It comes and goes, yes. Mostly after I eat, I think. Not every time, mind you. But… if I eat something heavy, it’s more likely to bother me. It's just a… queasiness, really. Nothing severe. And it passes relatively quickly. I don't want to make a fuss over nothing, Doctor.
DOCTOR: It’s good you’re describing everything to me, Ms. Durig. Even seemingly small details can be important. Now, let’s talk a little about your medical history. Do you have any known medical conditions?
PATIENT: Medical history… Oh, goodness. That was a long time ago. I had… the usual childhood illnesses, I suppose. Measles, mumps… nothing serious. And… a gallbladder removed, many years ago. Perhaps thirty years? More? And… I believe I had some trouble with my blood pressure once, but it was managed with medication. I stopped taking it a long time ago, though. Doctor said it was under control. Is that important?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s all very helpful, Ms. Durig. The gallbladder removal and the history of high blood pressure are important to know. Do you remember what medication you were taking for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. The name… it escapes me. It was a small white pill, I think. And I took it every morning. It started with a… "Di…" perhaps? Di-something. I'm so sorry, Doctor. My memory is just… a sieve. It was years ago, and I wasn't paying much attention to the details. The doctor handled everything.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Ms. Durig. It’s common to forget details like that, especially after a long time. We can look into it further if needed. Now, are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing at all. I stopped taking everything years ago. I try to eat a healthy diet, mostly fruits and vegetables. Though, as I mentioned, my appetite hasn't been very good lately. Just trying to take care of myself, the best I can.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not that I know of. I've never had a reaction to anything. I used to help my mother with her gardening, and I handled all sorts of plants without any trouble. She had a beautiful garden, full of roses and herbs. But that was a long time ago. I don't believe I have any allergies.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. Now, let’s talk a little about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family history… Oh dear. That's a difficult question. My family… we didn't talk much about illnesses. It wasn't considered polite, I suppose. My mother… she had some trouble with her heart, I think. But I don’t know the details. And my brother… he had some sort of… stomach trouble, years ago. But he lived far away, and we didn’t see each other often. I’m afraid I don’t have much information, Doctor. It's all very vague.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Ms. Durig. It’s common for family medical history to be incomplete. Now, I’d like to ask a few questions about your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, good heavens, no! Absolutely not. I’ve never touched a cigarette in my life. And I rarely drink alcohol. Perhaps a glass of wine with dinner on special occasions. But nothing more. And… recreational drugs? The very idea! I’m a respectable woman, Doctor. I’ve always lived a very… temperate life.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Durig. I apologize if my question was presumptuous. It’s simply part of a routine assessment. Now, let’s move on. Could you tell me a little about your living situation?
PATIENT: Well, I live alone, in a small apartment. It’s… comfortable enough. I’ve lived there for many years. I have a neighbor, Mrs. Henderson, who’s very kind. She checks on me from time to time. And a young man comes by to help with the groceries. I manage, you know? It’s… quiet. Perhaps a little too quiet, sometimes. But it's home.
DOCTOR: That sounds lovely, Ms. Durig. It’s good to have supportive neighbors. Now, before we proceed, would you mind if I performed a brief physical examination?
PATIENT: A physical examination… Well, if you think it’s necessary, Doctor. I suppose so. I haven’t been to a doctor in… a long time. But please be gentle. I’m… not as strong as I used to be.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Durig. I will be very gentle. We’ll start with listening to your heart and lungs, and then I’ll take a look at your abdomen. We'll also check your skin and eyes, as you mentioned the yellowing. Take a deep breath for me, please. And another… Good. Your heart sounds regular, but a little faint. Lungs are clear. Now, I’m going to gently press on your abdomen. Does this cause any discomfort?
PATIENT: Oh… that’s… a little strange. But alright. And… the abdomen? Yes, go ahead. Hmm… a little tender, yes. Especially… here. It’s not painful, exactly. Just… uncomfortable. Like a dull ache. It comes and goes, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright. I’m noting some tenderness in your upper right quadrant. And as you mentioned, there is noticeable yellowing of the skin and the whites of your eyes – what we call jaundice. Your skin also feels slightly warm to the touch. Okay, Ms. Durig. Based on what you’ve told me and what I’ve found during the examination, I’m concerned about possible liver issues. The jaundice, tenderness in your upper right quadrant, fatigue, and loss of appetite are all consistent with that. However, we need to run some tests to confirm this and determine the underlying cause. Would you be willing to have some blood work done?
PATIENT: Blood work? Oh dear. I… I don't like needles. But… if you think it's necessary, Doctor. Yes, alright. If it will help to find out what’s wrong. But please be quick, and… gentle. And tell me what you’re looking for. I like to know what’s happening, you know? It helps to calm my nerves. Is it… serious? What could it be?
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly understandable to be anxious about needles, Ms. Durig. We’ll be as quick and gentle as possible. And I'm happy to explain everything. The blood work will help us assess your liver function. We’ll be looking at levels of certain enzymes and proteins that can indicate liver inflammation or damage. It will also help us rule out other possible causes for your symptoms. There are many potential causes of liver problems, ranging from relatively mild infections to more serious conditions. It’s too early to say definitively what’s going on, but common possibilities include hepatitis, gallstones, or, less commonly, a blockage of the bile ducts. We need the test results to get a clearer picture. I'm going to order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and liver function tests. We’ll also need to do a urine analysis. The lab is just down the hall. While we wait for the results, I’m going to recommend that you avoid alcohol and any medications that could be hard on your liver. I’ll also give you a prescription for an anti-nausea medication to help with your appetite and discomfort. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Anti-nausea medication… that sounds good. And no alcohol, alright. I rarely drink anyway. Hepatitis… is that contagious? I don’t want to give anything to Mrs. Henderson. She’s such a dear. And… what if it is serious? What kind of treatment would I need? I don’t have any family, you know. And… I’m not insured. I don’t know how I’d pay for anything.
DOCTOR: Those are all very valid concerns, Ms. Durig. Let’s address them one by one. Hepatitis can be contagious, but there are different types. We'll determine which type, if any, you may have with the blood tests. If it is a contagious type, we’ll take appropriate precautions to prevent spread, and I'll provide you with clear instructions. Regarding treatment, it depends entirely on the cause and severity of the liver problem. Some conditions can be managed with medication and lifestyle changes, while others may require more intensive intervention. We’ll discuss all your options in detail once we have the test results. I understand you are uninsured, and that is a significant concern. We have a social worker on staff who can assist you with exploring financial assistance programs and navigating the cost of care. I'll make a referral for you to see her after our appointment. We will also see what assistance the hospital provides for uninsured patients. We’ll do everything we can to help you access the care you need, regardless of your financial situation. Right now, let’s focus on getting the tests done and gathering more information. I’ll also provide you with some written instructions outlining what to expect and when to contact me. Do you have any other questions or concerns I can address before you leave?
PATIENT: A social worker… that sounds helpful. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate that. No, I think… I think that’s all for now. I just want to get this over with and… find out what’s wrong. And hopefully, it’s nothing too serious. Thank you for being so patient with me. And for explaining everything so clearly. I was very worried. Perhaps… perhaps I’ll just go home and rest now. And try not to think about it too much. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Durig. It’s my job to help you, and I’m glad I could provide some reassurance. Remember, we’ll take this one step at a time. The lab is just down the hall – the nurse will guide you through the process. I’ll be in touch as soon as the results are available, usually within 24-48 hours. And please don’t hesitate to call my office if you have any questions or concerns before then. Take care of yourself, Ms. Durig. And try to rest. I’ll be in touch soon. .
