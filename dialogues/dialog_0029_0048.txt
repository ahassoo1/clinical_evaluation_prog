DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Mr. Lason. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Chora. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, doctor, it’s… frustrating, to be honest. My wife, she keeps saying I’m not thinking straight. Little things, you know? Like forgetting where I put my tools, or… not remembering what I was just saying mid-sentence. It’s not constant, but it happens enough that it’s worrying her, and frankly, it’s worrying me a little bit now too. It’s not like I’m losing my mind, but it’s… unsettling.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It’s good you’re addressing this. Memory lapses can be concerning, and it's wise to get them checked out. When did you first start noticing these issues?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think… it started, oh, maybe six months ago? At first, it was just misplacing things. I’ve always been a bit… particular about my tools, keep them just so. But then I started… repeating myself a little. Or asking my wife the same question twice in a row. She pointed it out, naturally. She has a very good memory, my wife. Better than mine, I’ll admit. It wasn’t sudden, not like a switch flipped, more… gradual. Like a slow leak.
DOCTOR: Alright, a gradual onset over six months. And it’s affecting things like recall of recent events and repetitive questioning. Are these memory issues interfering with your daily life at all?
PATIENT: Interfering? Well, not like I can’t work, understand? I’m a tile setter, always have been. Still doing jobs, still making a living. But it slows me down. I have to… double-check things more. Measure twice, cut once, you know? And sometimes I get confused on a job site. Which tile goes where, what order things need to happen. It’s embarrassing. My apprentice, he has to remind me sometimes. He's younger, of course. But still. It’s not the same as doing it myself, figuring it all out. It… it’s frustrating. My wife worries about me driving too, which… well, I don’t appreciate that. I’m a perfectly good driver.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it's impacting your work efficiency and causing some frustration and, potentially, safety concerns according to your wife. And you're experiencing some anxiety about it as well. Have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Changes? Hmm… let me think. My wife says I’ve been a little more… irritable. Which is nonsense, frankly. I’ve always had a strong personality. But she says I snap at her more easily. And sometimes… sometimes I feel a little… lost. Like I’m not quite present, you know? It’s hard to explain. Not sad, not anything like that. Just… distant. And I sleep… alright, I guess. Maybe not as soundly as I used to. Wake up a couple of times a night. Nothing major. But I’m… particular about my routines, doctor. Any little thing off throws me.
DOCTOR: Alright, irritability, a sense of detachment, and some sleep disturbance. Let’s talk about your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Well, doctor, I'm 66 years old. Something has to be a little off, right? I had my prostate acting up a few years back, had a little procedure for that. Nothing serious, thankfully. And I’ve always been a little…thin. Never had much of an appetite, if I’m honest. The doctor always tells me to eat more, but I just… don’t get hungry. Other than that… no, nothing major. No heart trouble, no diabetes. Blood pressure… sometimes a little high at the doctor’s office, but my wife checks it at home and says it's usually okay. I take a vitamin D supplement, the doctor said I was low on that. That’s about it, really. I've always been a pretty healthy man, considering. Worked hard my whole life. Don't smoke, hardly ever drink.
DOCTOR: Okay, so history of prostate issues treated, generally healthy, vitamin D supplementation, and tendency to be thin. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, doctor, no allergies. I’ve taken all sorts of things over the years, for aches and pains, minor infections. Never had a reaction to anything. My wife keeps a list of everything I’ve taken, just in case, but it’s mostly just… antibiotics, pain relievers. Nothing fancy. She’s very organized, my wife. More so than me, certainly. It’s a good thing, really. I’d lose track of everything if it were left to me.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. And you mentioned your wife keeps a list of medications—that's helpful. Let’s talk about your family history. Are there any instances of dementia or Alzheimer’s disease in your family?
PATIENT: Now that's a good question, doctor. My mother...she started forgetting things towards the end. Not all the time, but enough to worry us. My sister said it was just old age, but I remember her asking the same questions over and over. She didn’t… didn’t know who I was sometimes. It was… upsetting. And my uncle, on my father’s side, he was the same. Got very confused, needed someone to look after him. Never got a proper diagnosis, back in those days they didn’t know as much about those things. But… yes. There's history of that sort of thing on both sides of the family, unfortunately. Makes you wonder, doesn’t it?
DOCTOR: Okay, significant family history of dementia. That's important information. I’d like to do a quick physical exam and a few simple cognitive tests. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Well, I don't like being poked and prodded, understand? I’m not a fan of doctors in general. But… if you think it's necessary, doctor, I suppose. Just… be gentle, alright? And don’t take too long. I have a tile job I need to finish on Friday. And my wife… she gets worried when I'm gone too long. So, yes. Do what you need to do. But quickly, if you please.
DOCTOR: Alright, I understand. I’ll be as quick and gentle as possible. Let's start with your vital signs. Blood pressure is 142 over 88. A bit elevated, but not drastically so. Pulse is 72, regular. Temperature is 98.6. Heart sounds are normal, lungs are clear. Now, I’m just going to check your reflexes. Reflexes are normal. I'm going to test your gait and balance as well. Gait is slightly unsteady, but nothing overly concerning. Now, I’ll do a quick cognitive assessment. I'm going to ask you a few questions to assess your memory and thinking skills. First, can you tell me today’s date?
PATIENT: Today’s date? Hmm. Let me think… it’s August… August the… second. Yes, August 2nd. 2025, of course. Is that right? My wife keeps track of these things, I just know the general date. It's important for the job, you know. Scheduling things. August 2nd, 2025. I hope I got that right. I think I got that right.
DOCTOR: That’s correct. Good. Now, can you tell me the names of three things we’ve talked about so far?
PATIENT: Three things… hmm. Let me see. Well, we talked about… my wife, of course. And… my job. Tile setting. And… the family history. Dementia. Yes, those three. My wife, the tile job, and the dementia in the family. Is that what you wanted? I'm trying, doctor. It's just… my mind isn't what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Now, I'm going to ask you to repeat these three words after me: Apple, Table, Penny. Apple, Table, Penny. Can you repeat those for me?
PATIENT: Apple… Table… Penny. Yes, I can repeat them. Apple, Table, Penny. Is that what you wanted, doctor? They're simple words, of course. Not difficult. Apple, Table, Penny. I think I have a good memory, generally. But sometimes… sometimes things slip. It's frustrating, you know? Like trying to hold water in your hands. It just… leaks away. Apple, Table, Penny. Are we done yet?
DOCTOR: Alright. Now I’m going to ask you a series of simple calculation questions. What is 7 plus 5?
PATIENT: Seven plus five… hmm. Let me think. Seven… and five… It's… it's twelve. Yes, twelve. Seven plus five is twelve. I used to be good at numbers, you know? Running the job, ordering materials. But now… it takes a little longer to figure things out. Twelve, is it? I hope that's right. My wife does all the serious calculations now. She's much better at it than me. Twelve.
DOCTOR: Okay. Now, what is 100 minus 7?
PATIENT: One hundred minus seven… hmm. That’s… that’s… 93. Yes, 93. One hundred minus seven is 93. I’m sure of it. It’s simple arithmetic, doctor. Not rocket science. 93. Honestly, these questions are a little… insulting, don’t you think? I'm a tile setter, not a child. 93. But I’m answering them, aren’t I? Just to be polite. 93.
DOCTOR: Okay. Alright, Mr. Lason. Based on the information you’ve provided, your history, and the brief cognitive assessment, there are some areas of concern. Your memory lapses, irritability, and family history of dementia are red flags. While the cognitive assessment wasn’t definitive, there is some difficulty with recall and simple calculations. Now, I want to be very clear: this does not necessarily mean you have dementia. There are many other possible causes for these symptoms, such as vitamin deficiencies, thyroid problems, or even side effects from medication. But given your family history, we need to investigate further. I’m going to order a comprehensive blood panel to check for any underlying medical conditions. I also want to schedule an MRI of your brain to rule out any structural abnormalities. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: An MRI? Honestly, doctor, that sounds… unpleasant. I don't like being confined in small spaces. And it sounds expensive. But… my wife would want me to, wouldn’t she? She worries so much. And… you're right, my family history. It’s… unsettling. Okay. Yes, do the blood work. And… and the MRI, if you think it’s necessary. But please, doctor, make it as quick and painless as possible. And explain everything to my wife. She’ll want to know. I just… I don’t want any surprises. And if it is something serious… well, I don’t even want to think about it. But we need to know, don’t we? Yes, do the tests. Just… be gentle.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Lason. I understand your concerns, and I'll do my best to make the process as smooth and comfortable as possible. We'll discuss the MRI in detail beforehand, and I'll explain what to expect. As for the blood work, I’ll send the order to the lab right away, and they’ll contact you to schedule an appointment. I’m also going to prescribe you a Vitamin B12 supplement. Low B12 levels can cause memory problems, and it's a simple fix. In the meantime, if you experience any sudden changes in your memory, such as getting lost or having trouble recognizing familiar faces, please come back immediately, or go to the nearest emergency room. I’ll schedule a follow-up appointment for two weeks from today to discuss the results of the tests. Does that work for you?
PATIENT: Two weeks… yes, that should work. My wife will remind me. She's very good at scheduling things. A Vitamin B12 supplement… alright. As long as it doesn’t have any side effects. And… if I get lost? That’s a little… frightening to think about. But okay. I’ll come back immediately. And my wife will be with me. She always is. Yes, two weeks. Thank you, doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me. And… please, explain everything to my wife. She’ll want to know. It’s… unsettling, you understand. Very unsettling. But we’ll face it, together. Yes, together.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Lason. I’ll make sure your wife is fully informed and involved in your care. I'll also provide her with detailed information about the tests and potential next steps. Here are the lab orders and the prescription for the Vitamin B12. And here’s a pamphlet about memory loss and dementia, just for informational purposes. Please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. We’re here to support you and your wife through this. I wish you both all the best. Take care, and we'll see you in two weeks. .
PATIENT: Thank you, doctor. I appreciate it. You’ve been very… thorough. And kind. Yes, thank you. My wife will be pleased. We’ll see you in two weeks. Hopefully, everything will be alright. .
