DOCTOR: Hi Waleed, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Hernandez. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Yeah, hi Doctor. It’s… for a life insurance thing. They need me to get a medical exam, that’s all. Just want to get it over with, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. A life insurance exam. No problem at all, we can definitely get that done for you. It’s pretty straightforward. Just a standard check-up. Before we start, let’s just confirm some basic information. I see here your name is Waleed Putney, age 49… and your height and weight are listed as 174 centimeters and 97 kilograms, is that correct?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s right. Everything’s correct so far. Look, I gotta be honest, I’m not great with remembering numbers. Hope that’s okay.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, no problem at all! Don't worry about a thing. I have excellent recall, so I'll make sure we get everything documented accurately. Okay, so to start, could you tell me a little bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: Medical history… hmm. Well, I don’t really have much of one, to be honest. I’ve been pretty lucky, I guess. Had the usual childhood stuff, measles and chickenpox, but nothing serious. I had my appendix out when I was a kid, maybe ten years old? Other than that… not much. I've been seeing Doctor Kaimana for a few years now, just regular checkups. He's retired now, though.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to know. No major illnesses or surgeries other than the appendectomy when you were ten. And you saw Dr. Kaimana for regular checkups before he retired. Do you remember roughly when you had your appendix out – what year, approximately?
PATIENT: Oh, man, that was… a long time ago. Let me think… I was still living with my folks, so… probably around 1987? Maybe ‘88? Something like that. I was a little kid, so I wasn’t paying attention to the dates. I just remember being really sick, then waking up in the hospital.
DOCTOR: Okay, 1987 or ‘88 for the appendectomy. That’s helpful. Alright. And what about your family?
PATIENT: Family… my mom passed away a few years back, heart trouble. My dad’s still alive, he's 82, but he’s… not doing so great. Lives in a nursing home. And I got a sister, she lives on the mainland. She's healthy, as far as I know. We don’t talk much, though. I don’t think anyone else has had any major problems, but honestly, I haven't really asked. We don’t really talk about that stuff.
DOCTOR: Okay, so your mother passed away from heart trouble, your father is 82 and in a nursing home, and your sister is healthy. You haven’t had much conversation about medical history with them, which is understandable. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope, not that I know of. I eat pretty much anything. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything, as far as I can remember. I’m good. Let’s just get this over with, if you don’t mind.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, we can proceed. Just a few more quick questions, then we’ll get to the physical exam. Are you currently taking any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, vitamins, supplements – anything at all?
PATIENT: Nah, nothing. I try to stay away from pills if I can. I drink a lot of water, that’s about it. I used to take something for my stomach, a long time ago, but I stopped. I can’t even remember what it was called. Doctor Kaimana gave it to me.
DOCTOR: Okay, no current medications, and you previously took something for your stomach, prescribed by Dr. Kaimana. Alright. Now, I just want to get a quick overview of your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, no, and no. Never touched any of that stuff. I used to drink a little beer with my dad sometimes, when I was younger, but that was a long time ago. Now I just stick to water. Honestly, I don't really go out much. Mostly just work.
DOCTOR: Okay, no smoking, no recreational drugs, and very minimal alcohol use. Mostly just water, and you spend most of your time at work. Alright, that’s very helpful. Now, let’s do a quick physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, fine. Let's just get it done. I got things to do.
DOCTOR: Okay. We’ll start with your blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. Then I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and take a look in your ears, nose, and throat. This cuff will tighten around your arm for a moment… just relax. 138 over 82. Not bad. Pulse is 72 and regular. Temperature is 98.6. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Ears are clear. Nasal passages are clear. Throat looks normal. No signs of infection. Everything sounds and looks good so far. Now, I just want to quickly palpate your abdomen. Just let me know if anything feels tender.
PATIENT: Okay, go ahead. It's been a little sore lately, to be honest. But it’s nothing major. Probably just something I ate.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’m just feeling for any tenderness or abnormalities… Any discomfort here?
PATIENT: Yeah, a little bit, right… about there. Not really pain, just… uncomfortable. Feels kinda tight.
DOCTOR: Okay, I notice some mild tenderness in the right lower quadrant. No guarding or rebound tenderness. Is this discomfort constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It comes and goes. Been happening for a few weeks now. I figured it was just something I ate, like I said. I haven’t really paid much attention to it. Work keeps me busy, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay. And have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits lately?
PATIENT: Uh… not really. Same as always. Look, I really don't like talking about this stuff. Can we just get this insurance thing done? It’s not like I’m sick.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Just want to make sure we cover everything. Given the tenderness in your right lower quadrant, and the fact that it’s been going on for a few weeks, I think it would be best to order some blood work, just to rule out anything serious. It’ll give us a better picture of what’s going on. I’m going to order a Complete Blood Count, a Comprehensive Metabolic Panel, and a urinalysis. That will help us check for infection, inflammation, and any other potential issues. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. Just tell me where to go to get it done. I just want this whole thing to be over with.
DOCTOR: Okay. I'll have the lab draw the blood here at the clinic. I'll just print out a requisition form for you. It will take about 15 minutes. Once the results are back, we can discuss them. .
