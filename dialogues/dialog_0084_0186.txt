DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kingan. I’m Dr. Voytek. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just need a check-up for… a team tryout. Gotta make sure I'm good to go, you know? Don't want anything holding me back.
DOCTOR: Okay, a check-up for a team tryout. That's good planning. How old are you, if you don’t mind me asking?
PATIENT: Sixty-two. Yeah, I know, a little old for tryouts, maybe? But I stay in shape. Just need to make sure everything is still working, ha.
DOCTOR: Sixty-two is fantastic! Staying active at any age is wonderful. And it’s smart to get checked out before starting something new. Let me pull up a space to document everything. Now, aside from wanting to make sure everything is "still working," are you experiencing any specific symptoms – any pain, shortness of breath, dizziness, or anything else that’s been bothering you?
PATIENT: Nah, nothing like that, thankfully. No pain, no shortness of breath… feel pretty good, actually. Just… getting older, you know? Always good to double check. I don't want to be surprised during the tryout.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to hear. No current symptoms is a good start. Have you had a physical exam recently – within the last year, perhaps?
PATIENT: Hmm… not really. It’s been… a while. Probably five, maybe six years? I tend to avoid doctors if I can help it, honestly. Just busy with… life, you know? Didn’t need one before this tryout came up.
DOCTOR: Okay, five or six years is a bit of a gap, but we can definitely get you checked out now. Do you have any known medical conditions – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, heart problems, anything like that?
PATIENT: Nope. Nothing I know of. Never been diagnosed with anything, thankfully. Family history… my dad had a bit of a bad back when he got old, but that’s about it. I don't have insurance, so I usually just tough things out.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known medical conditions or significant family history – that's good. And I understand about not having insurance; we'll do our best to keep things as streamlined as possible. Have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Nope. Never had surgery. Broke my arm when I was a kid, but that just needed a cast. Nothing serious. Always been pretty lucky, I guess. Look, is this going to take long? I got a bit of a schedule to keep.
DOCTOR: No major surgeries, good. And that’s great you've been lucky so far! I'll try to be as efficient as possible. We'll do a quick physical exam – listen to your heart and lungs, check your reflexes, and a few other things. Would you mind stepping up on the table so I can get started?
PATIENT: Alright, alright. Let's get this over with then. Quick is good. Just tell me if anything seems… off. Don’t wanna waste anyone’s time.
DOCTOR: Perfect. I'm just going to listen to your heart and lungs. Take deep breaths for me. Okay, your heart sounds regular, but I do hear a slight wheeze in your lower lungs. Have you had a cough recently, or any history of asthma or bronchitis?
PATIENT: A slight wheeze? Hmm… I have been a little… dusty lately. Working on a project outside, cleaning up an old building. Figured it was just the dust. No cough, though, and never been told I had asthma or… whatever that other thing was. Just the dust, probably. Is that bad?
DOCTOR: Okay, it could very well be the dust. It's good you haven't had a cough. But a wheeze, even with a known cause like dust, is something we should note. Your throat looks clear, and your pupils are reacting normally. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes. Please relax your arms. Your reflexes are a bit diminished, but that can be normal with age. Do you have any numbness or tingling in your hands or feet?
PATIENT: Diminished reflexes… okay. No numbness or tingling, not that I've noticed. Just… a little stiff sometimes in the mornings, you know? Old age creepin’ in. Honestly, I’m not worried about it. Is this going to affect the tryout? That’s all I really care about.
DOCTOR: Okay, some morning stiffness is common. Let's check your blood pressure and pulse. Your blood pressure is a little elevated - 142/90. Pulse is 78 and regular. Now, could you stand up for me, please?
PATIENT: 142/90… is that bad? Elevated… what does that mean? I usually don’t go to doctors, so I don't understand these numbers.
DOCTOR: Okay, 142/90 is a little high, which we call hypertension. It's not an immediate emergency, but it's something we should keep an eye on. Walk for me, please. Your gait seems steady, but I do notice you're a bit slow. Do you have any problems with balance?
PATIENT: Slow? I'm sixty-two, Doctor! Balance is fine. Always been good on my feet. I used to… well, never mind. Old stories. So, can I try out or not? Is this blood pressure going to stop me?
DOCTOR: Okay, you seem steady enough on your feet. Your blood pressure could be a concern during strenuous activity, but let's not jump to conclusions. Because you haven’t had a checkup in several years, and your blood pressure is elevated, I recommend getting an EKG done. It’s a quick, painless test that will give us a better idea of your heart health. And to be on the safe side, I'd like to check your oxygen levels. This just clips onto your finger. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: An EKG… more tests. Fine, fine. Whatever it takes. Just want to get this over with and see if I’m good to go. Oxygen levels, fine. Hurry it up, would ya? I got things to do.
DOCTOR: Okay, your oxygen saturation is 96%, which is good. That’s reassuring. Okay. Your pulse is still 78 and regular. Because of your age, elevated blood pressure, and the length of time since your last checkup, I also recommend a basic metabolic panel. It's a blood test that checks your kidney function and blood sugar levels. It’s important to get a baseline, especially before starting any strenuous activity. I’m going to order these tests. Do you have a preferred lab?
PATIENT: Preferred lab? No. I just go to whatever's closest. Don't really care. Just… how much is all this going to cost? I don’t have insurance, remember? I can't afford a fortune. I just need to know if I'm fit enough to try out. That's all.
DOCTOR: Okay, no preferred lab, that’s fine. I understand your concern about the cost. Without insurance, the EKG will likely be around $150-200, and the basic metabolic panel could be another $80-150. I’ll see if the lab offers any discounts for self-pay patients, and I can give you a list of affordable labs in the area. For now, I recommend against participating in the tryout until we get these results back. Strenuous activity with elevated blood pressure could be risky. We need to rule out any underlying heart issues before you put yourself through that. I know it's frustrating, but it's better to be safe than sorry. Would you like me to write you a note explaining this to the team?
PATIENT: No… no, don’t bother with a note. They won’t understand. No tryout, then? After all this? Just… sixty-two years old, and can't even try out for a team. Fine. Order the tests. Just… let me know when they’re done. I guess I’ll go home now.
DOCTOR: I understand your disappointment, Mr. Kingan. It's not about not being able to, it’s about making sure you're healthy enough to do so safely. And sixty-two is absolutely still full of life and potential! We'll get these results back as quickly as possible, and then we can discuss your options. Here's the requisition form. I've included the lab addresses and phone numbers. They'll likely require payment at the time of service. I’ll have my nurse call you with the results as soon as they come in. In the meantime, if you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath, or dizziness, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
