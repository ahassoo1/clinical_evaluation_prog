DOCTOR: Alright, Mrs. Abdollahi, good morning. Have a seat. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Is… is Billman, yes? My daughter, she make the appointment for me. Is for the… the old people place. She want me to be sure I am okay to go there.
DOCTOR: Right. The… assisted living facility. Yes, your daughter mentioned that when she scheduled. So, you're here for a check-up to make sure you're healthy enough for the transition?
PATIENT: Yes, yes. She worry too much, my daughter. But is good. I want to be sure too. Is… hard to get old, you know? But I feel okay. Mostly okay.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s good you're proactive about this. "Mostly okay" is a good starting point. Can you tell me a little more about what "mostly okay" means?
PATIENT: Hmm… My knees, they hurt sometimes. When the weather is cold. And I get tired faster now. Used to work all day, no problem. Now… maybe afternoon, I need to sit. But no big problems. I eat good, I think. My husband, he cook. Very good cook!
DOCTOR: That's helpful to know. The knee pain is that a new thing, or has that been going on a while?
PATIENT: Oh, a long time now. Maybe… ten years? More? I don’t remember exactly. Is not… bad pain. Just… reminds me I am old. Heh. I take pills sometimes, when is very cold. My daughter buy them for me.
DOCTOR: Okay, pills for the knee pain when it flares up. Do you know what kind of pills they are?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Is a white pill. Small. I… I don't know the name. She bring it to me in the bottle. I just take it when I need. Is good, it help. But I don't like to take too many pills.
DOCTOR: Alright. We’ll figure that out later. It’s important to know exactly what medications you’re taking. Now, aside from the knees and getting tired, are you having any other issues?
PATIENT: No… not really. I forget things sometimes, but who doesn't when you are old? My husband, he says I ask the same questions. But is okay. We laugh about it. Is not… serious. I still cook a little, still clean the house. Not like before, but… I am still me.
DOCTOR: Okay. And how’s your appetite been?
PATIENT: Good, very good! My husband, he make good food. Rice and beans, plantains… sometimes fish. I eat like a bird, maybe, but I eat. And I drink water. My daughter always tell me to drink more water. She worry about everything!
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look in your ears and throat. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that is fine. Whatever you need, Doctor. I trust you. My daughter say you are very good. Please, go ahead.
DOCTOR: Good. If you could just have a seat here, we’ll get started. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath in and out for me.
PATIENT: Okay. Deep breath, yes. Like this? Is cold in here.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's perfect. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear bilaterally, but there's some mild wheezing. Not too concerning, but we'll keep an eye on it. Blood pressure is 140/90. A little elevated, but not drastically so. Do you normally have blood pressure checked?
PATIENT: Sometimes. My daughter, she have the machine. She check it when I visit. But I don’t remember the numbers. Is always… a number. Is that bad, the 140/90? My husband, he have high blood pressure.
DOCTOR: It's a bit high, yes. We'll want to monitor that. It’s not immediately alarming, but it does warrant attention. Given your husband’s history, it’s likely something you’ve inherited. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes and strength. Can you squeeze my hand as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: Yes, I can squeeze. Is this okay? I don't want to break your hand, Doctor. My grip is stronger than it looks. My husband always say I can open anything.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mrs. Abdollahi. You have good strength. Reflexes are a little diminished, which is normal for your age. Now, let's take a look at your ears and throat. Open wide and say “Ahhh.” Throat looks clear. Ears are also clear. Do you have any trouble with your vision or hearing?
PATIENT: No, not really. Maybe I need glasses for reading now. The small letters, they are hard to see. And sometimes… sometimes I don't hear when my husband speak softly. He laugh at me, but is okay. He speak very fast, that is the problem. He always has something to say.
DOCTOR: Okay. It sounds like some age-related changes are occurring, which is perfectly normal. Now, have you had any recent changes in weight?
PATIENT: Hmm… no, not really. Maybe a little. But I think my clothes just get smaller. That is what my daughter say. She say I am losing weight, but I feel the same. I eat good, like I say. My husband make sure of that.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mrs. Abdollahi. Let's talk about your medications. You mentioned your daughter brings you pills for your knees, but you don’t know the name. Do you take anything else regularly?
PATIENT: No… just the knee pills when is cold. And sometimes, when my stomach hurt, I take a little something. A white pill too, I think. But not every day. My neighbor, she give it to me. Is good for… for everything, she say. But I don’t remember the name of that one either. My daughter, she get mad when I take pills from my neighbor.
DOCTOR: Okay. It's important that we have a complete list of everything you're taking, even if it's just occasionally. Taking medication without knowing what it is can be dangerous. We need to identify these pills. Can you describe the packaging they came in?
PATIENT: Hmm… the knee pills come in a orange bottle. Small bottle. And the other ones… I think they come in a plastic bag. White bag. My neighbor, she just give it to me like that. She say is good for everything, like I say. I don’t think she have a bottle. Is… a little embarrassing. I forget things.
DOCTOR: Mrs. Abdollahi, I understand you forget things, and that's okay. But taking medication from your neighbor without knowing what it is, or what it does, is a serious health risk. It’s important for me to be aware of everything you're taking so I can ensure your safety. We need to get a list of these medications, and I strongly advise against taking anything you don't know. Now, let's talk about your family history. Do you have any known medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Yes… my mother, she have the sugar. Diabetes, my daughter call it. And my father… he have problems with his heart. He… he die when he was not so old. And my sister… she have the high blood pressure, like my husband. Is a lot of problems in my family. I worry about getting sick, like them.
DOCTOR: Okay, a family history of diabetes, heart problems and high blood pressure. That's important to know. Now, do you smoke or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: No, no smoking. Never smoke. And I don't drink alcohol. Not much. Sometimes, at Christmas, I take a little sip of wine with my husband. But not every year. And just a little sip. He likes his beer, though. He drink a little every day. Not too much, he say.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mrs. Abdollahi. Based on what you've told me, and the physical exam, it sounds like you have some normal age-related changes occurring, and a family history that puts you at risk for certain conditions. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, and we need to identify the medications you’re taking from your neighbor and your daughter. I’m going to order some blood work to check your blood sugar, cholesterol, and kidney function. I also want you to bring in all your medications, even the ones you only take occasionally, so we can identify them. Before we finish, do you have any questions for me?
PATIENT: Blood work… is that going to hurt? And the pills… I will try to find them. My daughter, she will be mad I don’t remember. Is… hard to keep track of everything. Do you think I will be okay to go to the old people place? That is what I really want to know.
DOCTOR: The blood work is just a simple prick of a needle, Mrs. Abdollahi. It will cause a little discomfort, but it shouldn't hurt too much. And don't worry about the pills, we'll figure it out together. As for the assisted living facility, based on what we've discussed today, I don't see any immediate reason why you couldn’t go. However, we need the blood work results and a complete medication list to make a more informed decision. It’s important to address your blood pressure and ensure you’re on the right medications. I’ll have the lab technician draw your blood now, and then we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results. Do you have any other questions or concerns before we proceed?
PATIENT: No… I think that is all. Just… thank you, Doctor. My daughter, she worry too much. Maybe this will make her feel better. I hope the blood work is not too bad. And I will try to find the pills. Where do I go for the blood work?
DOCTOR: You're welcome, Mrs. Abdollahi. The lab is just down the hall to your left. The technician is expecting you. They'll explain the process. And don't worry, we'll take things one step at a time. We'll get to the bottom of everything. If you feel unwell at any point before your follow-up appointment, please don’t hesitate to call the office.
PATIENT: Okay. Thank you, Doctor Billman. .
