DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Squiers. I am Dr. Pipkorn. Please, have a seat. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. I’m here because I’m going on a cruise next month – the 15th, to be precise – and the cruise line needs some information from a doctor. Just a bit of paperwork, really. They want to make sure I’m alright to travel, you understand. It's a bit of a formality, I suppose.
DOCTOR: A formality, you say. Well, even formalities require due diligence. I understand you're going on a cruise. And they’ve requested a medical evaluation. Very well. To start, could you tell me a bit about your overall health?
PATIENT: Oh, certainly. Well, I’m generally quite fit for my age, I think. I don’t get sick often, not a cold or anything. I walk most days, about a mile, down to the village and back. I eat reasonably well, though I do enjoy a good biscuit with my tea. I lost my husband, Alistair, three years ago, and that was a shock, of course, but I’ve been keeping myself busy since. He was a strong man, Alistair. Never a day’s illness in his life. But my health, as such… it’s been steady. No major problems. I haven't been to a doctor in… oh, goodness, I’d have to think. Perhaps five years? For a check-up, you understand.
DOCTOR: Five years. Right. And in those five years, have you experienced any new or unusual symptoms?
PATIENT: No, not really. Nothing I’d call unusual, anyway. My knees sometimes ache a bit after a long walk, but that’s just age, I expect. And I get a wee bit tired towards the end of the day, but who doesn’t? Nothing that stops me from doing what I want, mind you. I still manage the window displays at Mr. Henderson’s shop, you see. It’s a bit of work, arranging everything just so, but I enjoy it. It keeps my mind active. Are you wanting me to list every ache and pain, Doctor? It feels alright to say I've been feeling normal.
DOCTOR: While I appreciate your attempt to summarize, "feeling normal" is rather subjective, Ms. Squiers. And a thorough assessment is crucial, even for what appears to be routine. Let’s try a more systematic approach. Do you have any chronic medical conditions – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, or arthritis?
PATIENT: No, none of those. The doctor always told Alistair to watch his blood pressure, but mine was always fine. Perfectly normal, he said. And I certainly don’t have diabetes – I enjoy a sweet treat now and then, but not to excess! Arthritis… no, my joints just ache a bit, as I said, but it's not a proper arthritis, not like Mrs. MacIntyre down the road. She can barely move her fingers! It's just a little stiffness, really. I don't take any medicine for it. Honestly, Doctor, I’m quite sure I'm in good health. It feels a little strange to be questioned so closely when I just need a form signed.
DOCTOR: Ms. Squiers, the cruise line requires this evaluation to ensure your safety, and my responsibility is to provide them with an accurate assessment. Now, have you ever been hospitalized for any reason?
PATIENT: No, never. Not once. Alistair had his appendix out when he was a boy, but that was many years ago. I’ve been fortunate, I suppose. A few childhood illnesses, measles and such, but nothing serious. I’ve always been a strong, healthy woman. I helped on the farm when I was younger, you know. Hard work, but it kept me fit. Honestly, Doctor, I’m starting to feel a bit… put out, if you don’t mind me saying so. Is this really necessary for a simple cruise? Perhaps a quick check of my pulse would suffice?
DOCTOR: Ms. Squiers, with all due respect, I am attempting to gather a complete medical history. A pulse check is insufficient. Now, let’s move on. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, none that I know of. I can eat anything, really. Alistair was the one with the sensitive stomach, always complaining about something he’d eaten. I never had any trouble. I eat shellfish, nuts, berries… everything. And I've taken antibiotics a few times over the years for a sore throat or something, but I never had a reaction. Honestly, Doctor, I think I'm quite a straightforward case. I'm not a fragile person. I'm rather robust, you see. Is there a quicker way to do this? I do have some errands to run this afternoon.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let’s try a brief review of systems. Have you experienced any recent changes in your weight, appetite, or sleep patterns?
PATIENT: No, not really. My weight has been pretty steady, I suppose. Perhaps a pound or two up or down, but nothing significant. I eat a good breakfast, a light lunch, and a decent dinner. I don't skip meals. And my sleep... well, I sleep soundly enough. Sometimes I wake up in the night, but who doesn't? It's usually just to use the bathroom, or if I've had a particularly strong cup of tea before bed. I don't have any trouble falling asleep, though. I'm usually quite tired by the end of the day, after all the walking and the window displays. Do you need to know exactly how many hours I sleep, Doctor? It feels a bit excessive to ask such detailed questions.
DOCTOR: Ms. Squiers, I understand your frustration, but I assure you, these questions are important. Have you noticed any changes in your vision, hearing, or any new headaches or dizziness?
PATIENT: No, my vision is perfectly fine. I read the newspaper every morning, you know. And my hearing is good too – I can hear perfectly well when people speak to me. I don't have any trouble with that. And I don't get headaches or dizziness, not unless I stand up too quickly, perhaps. But that's just my age, I expect. It happens to everyone. Honestly, Doctor, I'm starting to feel like I'm being examined for a serious illness when all I need is a form signed for a cruise. Is there a nurse who could perhaps do this? A quicker, more efficient assessment?
DOCTOR: Ms. Squiers, I am the physician, and I must conduct this evaluation myself. Now, have you experienced any chest pain, shortness of breath, or palpitations?
PATIENT: No, absolutely not. My heart is perfectly fine. I've never had any chest pain or shortness of breath. And I don't get palpitations, not ever. I walk up and down hills every day, you know. A perfectly healthy walk! I would know if there was something wrong with my heart. I pay attention to my body. Honestly, Doctor, I'm not a frail, elderly woman. I'm quite robust, as I've said. This is getting quite tiresome. Perhaps I should just cancel the cruise. It seems to be causing more stress than enjoyment.
DOCTOR: Ms. Squiers, your frustration is noted. However, I must ask one final set of questions regarding your bowel and bladder habits. Have you experienced any recent changes in these areas?
PATIENT: Oh, for goodness sake! Now you're asking about that? Really, Doctor, is this truly necessary for a simple cruise? I mean, honestly! I'm a perfectly normal, healthy woman! Everything functions as it should, thank you very much. I don't have any trouble in that department. It’s all perfectly… regular. I haven’t noticed any changes whatsoever. This is quite… intrusive. I came here for a form, not a full medical examination. Perhaps I should just go home and forget about this cruise altogether. It seems a great deal of trouble.
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Squiers. Given your insistence on your good health, and your… resistance to a thorough assessment, I will proceed with a limited physical exam. I must, at the very least, check your blood pressure, pulse, and listen to your heart and lungs. However, please understand that this evaluation will be incomplete, and may not be sufficient for the cruise line’s requirements. Please sit back and relax… as much as you are able. We'll begin with your blood pressure.
PATIENT: Fine. Blood pressure is alright, I suppose. As long as it doesn't take too long. And please, be gentle. I don't like being poked and prodded. Just get it over with, and I can hopefully get on with my day. This is all rather upsetting, you know. A simple cruise. It shouldn't be this complicated.
DOCTOR: Your blood pressure is 140/90. Slightly elevated, but not drastically so. Pulse is 72 and regular. Now, if you would please take a deep breath… and another… Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Abdomen is soft, non-tender. Given the slightly elevated blood pressure, and the limited nature of this evaluation, I recommend a follow-up with your primary care physician upon your return from the cruise. They can perform more comprehensive testing and assess your overall cardiovascular health. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Alistair’s doctor was Dr. MacLeod, but he retired years ago. I haven’t really had a doctor since. I just… haven’t needed one. I’ve always been healthy. But a follow-up… with a doctor I don’t have? Seems a bit much for a slightly elevated blood pressure. Is that really necessary? And will this be enough for the cruise line? That’s what I need, really. A signed form. Not a lecture about needing a doctor. Honestly, Doctor, this is becoming quite a frustrating experience. I just want to go on my cruise.
DOCTOR: Ms. Squiers, I understand your frustration, but I must prioritize your safety. A slightly elevated blood pressure warrants further investigation, regardless of your previous good health. It could indicate underlying issues that require attention. As for the cruise line, I will complete the necessary form, stating that you are medically cleared for travel with the caveat that you follow up with a primary care physician upon your return for further evaluation of your blood pressure. This will be documented clearly on the form. Do you have any allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: No, none that I’m aware of. As I said before, I can take anything. Alistair always worried about allergies, but I never had any trouble. Honestly, Doctor, I'm starting to feel like you don’t believe me. It’s perfectly alright. No allergies. And please, just finish the form so I can go. I really must be going. My tea will be getting cold.
DOCTOR: Here is the completed form, Ms. Squiers. As stated, it includes the recommendation for a follow-up with a primary care physician upon your return. I strongly advise you to schedule an appointment promptly. While I have cleared you for travel based on your insistence, it is imperative to address the elevated blood pressure to prevent potential complications. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No. No, thank you. That’s all. I suppose. A follow-up… Honestly. Very well. Thank you, Doctor. I’ll… consider it. Good day.
