DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Baide. My name is Dr. Talen Delacour. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. To begin, could you tell me what brings you to the clinic this morning?
PATIENT: Ugh, morning. Look, Doc, I don't have all day. It's this hand, see? It shakes. Been happening for... well, a while now. Not a big deal, really. Just annoying. My wife used to say it was endearing, but... well, never mind. Can we just get this over with?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Baide. I understand your time is valuable, and we will do our best to be efficient. However, to properly assess what’s causing the shaking, I do need to ask a few questions. It’s important to gather as much information as possible, even if it seems minor. When you say “a while now,” could you be more specific?
PATIENT: Specific? What do you mean, specific? Honestly, doctors these days... It started... geez. Maybe a year? Two? I don’t keep track of these things. It wasn't sudden, it just... gradually got worse. Before you ask, no, I didn’t fall or hit my hand or anything. It just started. Is that good enough for you? I was still working then, you know. Producing. Big stuff.
DOCTOR: Yes, that is helpful, Mr. Baide. Thank you. “Gradually getting worse over a year or two” gives me a better timeframe. And it's good to know there wasn't any injury that triggered it. Could you describe the shaking to me?
PATIENT: Describe it? It... shakes. What do you want me to say? It's like... a little tremor. When I try to hold something steady, it wobbles. Especially when I'm trying to eat soup. Makes a mess, you know? And holding a glass… forget about it. Used to be able to hold anything. Now? It's embarrassing. It’s not constant, though. Sometimes it's better, sometimes it's worse. Depends. Look, I’m a busy man, Doc. Are we getting anywhere with this?
DOCTOR: We are, Mr. Baide, we are. It’s helpful to know it’s not constant and is worse with activities like eating and holding a glass. That gives us some clues. Do you notice anything that specifically makes it worse?
PATIENT: Specifically? Hmph. Well, stress, I guess. When I'm… agitated. Or thinking too hard. And coffee. Definitely coffee. I used to drink a lot of it, back in the day, running around on sets. Now, even a little bit and I'm rattling like a tin can. Used to be able to handle anything, I tell ya. Anything. Not like these youngsters these days. They can't take a bit of pressure. Now, are you gonna poke around with this hand, or what?
DOCTOR: Yes, I would like to examine your hand and arm, Mr. Baide. It will help me assess the nature of the tremor. Before we do that, though, could you tell me a little bit about any other medical conditions you have, or medications you are currently taking?
PATIENT: Medical conditions? Oh, jeez. I'm eighty years old, Doc, what don't I have? High blood pressure, I think. Something with my cholesterol. And arthritis, of course. Everything aches, you know? As for medications… Let me think. I take something for the pressure… a little white pill, I think. And something for the arthritis. I don’t even bother looking at the bottles anymore, my housekeeper fills them. Medicare handles it all, so I just take what they give me. Honestly, I don't pay much attention to these things. Can we just get this over with? I have a lunch meeting. Important people.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Baide. It's not uncommon to have multiple medications as we get older. Knowing you have high blood pressure and arthritis is helpful. And it’s good to know Medicare manages your prescriptions. Before I examine your hand, could you tell me about any family history of tremors or neurological conditions?
PATIENT: Tremors? Family history… Hmph. My mother, now she was a nervous woman. Always fidgeting, tapping her foot. Maybe she had something. My father was a strong, silent type. Didn't show much of anything. And my brother... well, he drank too much. That makes your hands shake, you know? But nothing like this. Look, I'm not a doctor, Doc. I just know my hand is shaking and it’s annoying. Are you going to do something or just keep asking questions? I really don't have time for this.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Baide. The questions are important to help me determine the cause of the tremor and the best course of action. Alright, let’s proceed with the examination. If you could just extend your arms in front of you, palms up. I'm going to assess your muscle tone and reflexes. Then I’ll ask you to perform a few simple tasks. Okay, Mr. Baide, I’ve observed the tremor. At rest, it appears to be a resting tremor, meaning it's most prominent when your hand is at rest. When you attempt to move your hand, it becomes more of an action tremor. I also noted some rigidity in your muscles and slight difficulty with coordination.
PATIENT: Rigidity? Coordination? What are you saying, Doc? I was a producer! I had to coordinate hundreds of people! I’m not falling apart, you know. It’s just a little shake. My wife… she always said it made me look distinguished. But now you're telling me I'm… rigid? Look, I don't like the sound of this. Is this something serious? Are you going to give me some pills or what? I’ve got important meetings, Doc. I can’t be shaking during negotiations!
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Baide. It’s natural to feel anxious when you're unsure about your health. I’m not saying you’re falling apart, and I appreciate you sharing your background as a producer – that demonstrates excellent coordination skills. Based on my initial examination, the tremor you’re experiencing, along with the rigidity, could be indicative of several possibilities, including essential tremor or Parkinson’s disease. However, it’s too early to make a definitive diagnosis. Further investigation is required. To help us determine the cause, I would like to order some blood tests to rule out other potential causes. And I recommend a referral to a neurologist for a more comprehensive evaluation, including a possible DaTscan to assess dopamine levels in the brain. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: DaTscan? Blood tests? Neurologist? Are you serious, Doc? This is just a little shake! You're going to put me through all that? I don't like the sound of this at all. Parkinson's? Is that what you’re thinking? My wife had that. It was awful. Look, I don't want to go through all that. Can’t you just give me something for the shaking? A pill? Something simple? I’m an old man, Doc. I don’t need all these tests. It’ll just stress me out more. Honestly, I think you’re overreacting. Can we just forget about the tests and the neurologist and just try a pill? Please? I have a very important lunch meeting. Very important.
DOCTOR: I understand your apprehension, Mr. Baide, and I sincerely apologize if I’ve caused you any distress. I assure you, my intention is not to cause undue stress, but to ensure you receive the best possible care. You are right to be concerned about a potential diagnosis of Parkinson’s disease. It's a serious condition, and it’s important to rule it out or confirm it with certainty. While a pill could temporarily alleviate the symptoms, it wouldn't address the underlying cause, and could potentially mask important signs that would help with a proper diagnosis. However, I respect your wishes. We can try a medication to help manage the tremor, but I strongly advise you to reconsider the referral to a neurologist. It’s the most responsible course of action. If you agree to try a medication, I can prescribe a low dose of propranolol, which is often used to treat tremors. We will monitor your response and adjust the dosage as needed. However, please be aware that propranolol is not suitable for everyone, and it has potential side effects. We would need to discuss those with you in detail before proceeding. Would you like to discuss the potential risks and benefits of propranolol?
PATIENT: Propranolol? Never heard of it. Risks? Side effects? Honestly, Doc, this is getting ridiculous. Fine. Fine! Give me the pill. Just get me through this lunch meeting. But if it makes me feel awful, I’m blaming you. And no neurologist. Understand? No tests. No scans. Just the pill. I’m an old man, Doc. I don’t have time for all this. And if it doesn’t work, don’t come crying to me. My wife… she always said I was a stubborn one. Guess I still am. Now, hurry up and write the prescription, will you? I'm losing precious time. Very precious time.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Baide. I will write you a prescription for propranolol 10mg, to be taken twice daily. Please be aware of the potential side effects, which can include fatigue, dizziness, lightheadedness, and low blood pressure. It’s crucial to start with a low dose and monitor your response closely. If you experience any concerning symptoms, stop taking the medication immediately and contact my office. I strongly recommend that you reconsider the referral to a neurologist, but I respect your decision. I will also provide you with a handout detailing the signs and symptoms of Parkinson’s disease, so you are aware of what to look for. Here is the prescription. Please schedule a follow-up appointment with me in two weeks so we can assess your response to the medication. And if you experience any changes in your condition, please don’t hesitate to contact my office sooner. Do you have any questions for me before you leave?
PATIENT: No. No questions. Just… get me out of here. I have a lunch meeting. A very important lunch meeting. Thank you, Doc. I guess. And don't expect me back.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Baide. I wish you the best of luck with your lunch meeting. And I sincerely hope you will reconsider a neurological evaluation in the future. .
