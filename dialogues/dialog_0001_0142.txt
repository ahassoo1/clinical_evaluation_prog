DOCTOR: Alright, Jaxston, right?
PATIENT: Yeah, that's me. Though, to be honest, I don't really... remember filling out a bunch of forms. Is everything alright? I just kinda showed up 'cause these headaches are… well, they're bad.
DOCTOR: Forms are always a pain. Look, I've got a waiting room full of actual patients, so let’s try to be concise. Headaches, you say?
PATIENT: Right, headaches. Yeah. They come on quick, and it feels like… my heart’s gonna beat outta my chest when they do. And I get really sweaty. It's happened a few times now, not sure how many exactly. It’s all a bit fuzzy, to be honest. Like, a really bad pressure, mostly in my head, but then everything feels off. Do you… get what I mean? It's hard to explain.
DOCTOR: "Fuzzy" isn't a medical term, Jaxston. Quick onset, pressure... and you said sweaty?
PATIENT: Yeah, really sweaty. Like, soaked. Not just a little damp, but like I ran a marathon. And it usually happens when I'm just... doing stuff. Nothing special, you know? Just walking around or sitting, then bam. Headache, heart racing, sweat. It doesn't seem to be tied to anything specific. It's just… random. Does that make it worse? That it's not… predictable? I don't know.
DOCTOR: Random is rarely helpful. Alright, let's get a basic exam done. I want to check your blood pressure, pulse, and listen to your heart. Just sit here and try to relax, if you can. It’ll be faster that way.
PATIENT: Okay, yeah, sure. Relaxing… right. I can try. It’s just… these headaches make it kinda hard to think straight, you know? Is this normal, though? Having these… episodes? Like, should I be worried? I don't really have anyone to ask.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is… elevated. Pulse is a little fast. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Look, I'm not going to sugarcoat things. These symptoms aren’t ideal. You said you don't have insurance, right?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s right. No insurance. Not since… well, a while ago. Is it… bad? Like, really bad? What could be causing it? I’ve not been eating great, if that matters. Mostly just whatever’s quick and easy. And I haven’t been sleeping properly either. But I figured it was just… life, you know? Is it something I should be really worried about?
DOCTOR: “Life” doesn’t usually involve heart-racing headaches and sweating. Poor diet and lack of sleep… can contribute to things. Look, it could be stress, anxiety, dehydration… a whole host of things. But we need to rule out anything serious. I'm going to order some basic blood work: CBC, electrolytes, and a thyroid panel. And, frankly, I think you should get an EKG just to be safe. It's just a precaution. We're going to need to get this done quickly, though. I’m not going to keep you all day.
PATIENT: Okay, blood work and… an EKG? Is that the thing with the sticky pads and the machine? I don’t really like hospitals, if I’m being honest. How long does that take? And how much is all this going to cost? I don’t have a lot of money, so I’m kinda worried about… well, everything, really. Is there anything I should do in the meantime? Like, before the tests? Just… try to relax more? It feels like a useless question.
DOCTOR: Relaxing is always a good idea, yes. The EKG is quick, a few minutes. Blood work...depends on the lab. As for cost… I don't have a price list memorized. You’ll need to check with the lab directly. Look, I'm a doctor, not a financial advisor. I can tell you what tests you need, not how to pay for them. There’s a lab down the street; I can write you a requisition. If you’re truly concerned about cost, you could go to the emergency room, but that’s going to be significantly more expensive. Now, do you want the requisition, or not?
PATIENT: Ugh. Okay, okay. Requisition. Yeah, please. Just… the requisition. And maybe a name of a cheaper lab, if you know one? I really appreciate it, even if you seem… busy. I just… I don't really know what I'm doing, you know? Everything just feels… confusing. I'll go get the tests done. I guess. And I'll try to relax, like you said. Though I don't see how that's gonna help with the headache, but… alright. Thank you.
DOCTOR: Here. There’s a lab on Elm Street, “County Labs.” They’re generally the cheapest around. Get the CBC, electrolytes, and thyroid panel done. And schedule an EKG. Bring the results back to me as soon as possible. Next patient.
PATIENT: .
