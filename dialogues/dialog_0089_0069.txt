DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Paguiо. I’m Dr. Roseburroogh. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. I’m here for a vaccination, I think. My… well, someone told me I needed to get one. I wasn't sure which one, exactly, but it’s about keeping up with things, you know? Just making sure I’m all set.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s perfectly alright. A lot of people come in needing to get "caught up" on vaccinations. Let me take a look at your chart here… Medicare, age 47… Height 155, weight 91… Hmm. Okay. To make sure I get you the right vaccination, could you tell me a little more about which one you were told about?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, that's all correct. I haven't been to a doctor in a little while, so I'm glad you're checking everything. Let me think… it was the nurse at the pharmacy, actually. She just said I was due for a booster. She didn't say which booster, specifically. Something about… staying protected against things going around? I don't really remember all the details, I'm afraid. I just know she said it was important.
DOCTOR: Okay, a booster… that narrows it down a little. There are a few different boosters you might be due for, depending on your health history and what you've had before. Have you had your COVID booster recently?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, I did get the COVID booster! I think it was… last spring? Around April, maybe? It was at a big clinic downtown. They had lots of people there. I remember getting a little sore arm afterward, but it wasn’t too bad. I think it was the updated one, too – the one they were recommending at the time.
DOCTOR: Good, that’s helpful. Okay, so you're up to date on COVID. Knowing that helps. Have you had a flu shot in the last year?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. I honestly can’t remember. I usually try to, but things get… busy. I think maybe not? It’s possible I did, but I don’t have a card or anything to prove it. I wouldn't be surprised if I missed it last year. My memory isn’t what it used to be, you know?
DOCTOR: That’s alright, it happens. We can definitely get you a flu shot today if you haven't had one recently. It’s especially important with the season approaching. Besides flu and COVID, are you aware of any other vaccinations you might need?
PATIENT: Oh, that sounds good, yes. The flu shot would be great. I always get a little worried about getting sick during the winter. As for other vaccinations… honestly, no, not really. I just… don’t keep track of those things. I always figure the doctor will let me know if I need something. Is there anything special I should be thinking about at my age? I haven’t really had any big health problems, thankfully. Just the usual aches and pains.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly reasonable. At 47, the main things we look at are keeping you up-to-date on tetanus/diphtheria/pertussis and pneumococcal vaccines, depending on when you last received them. Let me see… it looks like your last Tdap was over ten years ago, so you’re due for a booster. Pneumococcal… hmm. It depends on what kind of pneumococcal vaccine you had before. Do you remember getting one at all?
PATIENT: Oh, ten years… that’s a long time ago! I definitely don’t remember getting a pneumococcal vaccine. I think I would remember that name if I had. I used to get them when I was a kid, I think, but nothing recently. So, the Tdap booster sounds right, then? Is that the one that protects against…lockjaw? I think I remember hearing about that one being dangerous.
DOCTOR: Yes, exactly. Tdap protects against tetanus—which is lockjaw—diphtheria, and pertussis, also known as whooping cough. It’s a very important booster. Alright, so we’ll get you updated on your Tdap. And since you haven't had a recent flu shot, we can do that as well. Do you have any allergies to eggs or any vaccine components we should be aware of?
PATIENT: No, I don’t have any allergies, not that I know of. I eat eggs all the time, no problem. And I’ve had vaccinations before without any issues, so I don't think I have any reaction worries. Both shots today sound good to me, Doctor. Thank you for figuring everything out! It’s a relief to get this all sorted.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Alright, then. Let’s get you comfortable. We’ll do the flu shot in one arm, and the Tdap in the other. They can sometimes cause a little soreness at the injection site, but it usually goes away within a day or two. Please roll up your sleeves. And let me know if you feel faint or dizzy at any point during or after the injections.
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds good. Sleeves rolling up… Soreness is fine, I can handle that. I appreciate you explaining everything, Doctor. And I’ll definitely let you know if I start feeling funny. I'm ready when you are. Just… try to be quick, if you don't mind! Not a fan of needles, you see.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I’ll be as quick as possible. And I promise, it’s just a little pinch. Okay, all done. See?
PATIENT: Ouch! That wasn’t too bad, actually. You were right, just a little pinch. A little sore already, but nothing I can't handle. Thank you, Doctor! You really made that easy. Is there anything else I need to do, or any aftercare instructions?
DOCTOR: Glad to hear it wasn't too unpleasant! You might experience some mild soreness, redness, or swelling at the injection sites for a day or two. A cool compress can help with that if needed. Over-the-counter pain relievers like acetaminophen or ibuprofen are also fine if you’re uncomfortable. Just monitor for any severe reactions—like difficulty breathing or a widespread rash—and if you experience those, go to the emergency room immediately, but those are very rare. Otherwise, just go about your day as usual. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. Thank you again, Doctor Roseburroogh! You were very patient and helpful. I feel much better knowing I'm all caught up on my shots. Is there a card or something to show I've had these, in case I need it for travel or something?
DOCTOR: Here you go. This is your updated vaccination record. Keep this in a safe place – it's always good to have it on hand. And you can also access your vaccination history electronically through the patient portal on our website. Is there anything else I can assist you with before you go?
PATIENT: Oh, perfect! Thank you so much. I will definitely keep this safe. The electronic portal sounds good too, I'll have to look into that. No, I think that's everything, Doctor. You've been very thorough and kind. Have a good day! And thank you again for everything.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Paguiо! It was my pleasure. You have a good day as well, and don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns in the future.
