DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Goodstein. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Alanes. It's August 2nd, 2025. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. My name is Jammal Goodstein. It is… a problem with the gas. Too much gas, you understand? It is… embarrassing, really. But it has been happening a lot lately.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Goodstein. It can be quite uncomfortable and disruptive when gas is excessive. We’ll certainly try to figure out what’s going on. To help me understand a bit better, could you tell me more about this gas?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Well… it happens many times during the day. After I eat, mostly. But sometimes even when I have not eaten. It is… a loud sound. And the smell… not very good. I work at the burger place, you see, so maybe it is the food? But I eat the same food as everyone else.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it's happening multiple times a day, often after eating, but sometimes even when you haven't eaten. You mentioned it's loud and has an unpleasant odor. And you're wondering if your work at the burger place might be a factor, since you eat the same food as your coworkers?
PATIENT: Yes, exactly. That is right. My coworkers… they do not have this problem. They eat the same burgers, the same fries… everything. I feel… strange to be different. It is not a comfortable feeling, you see. Also, I do not drink milk, if that matters. I do not like the taste.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful to know. No milk consumption. And your coworkers aren’t experiencing the same issues, despite eating the same foods. Let's try to get a better understanding of what else might be going on. Could you describe what the gas feels like before it happens?
PATIENT: Hmm… before it happens? It is… a feeling of fullness. Like I have too much air in my stomach, maybe? And sometimes… a little bit of cramping. Not very strong, but… uncomfortable. It is low down, in the belly. And then… poof. It comes out. I am sorry for the details.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize, Mr. Goodstein. These details are very important. Fullness and mild cramping low in your abdomen before the gas release. Now, thinking about your diet in general, besides the food at work, are there any other foods or drinks that seem to make it worse?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Beans, yes. Definitely beans. Even a small amount. And… sometimes bread. But not all bread. The white bread is okay. The brown bread… that makes more gas. And… I like cabbage sometimes. But that is… bad. Very bad. My mother makes good cabbage, but it is not good for my stomach, you see.
DOCTOR: Okay, so beans, brown bread, and cabbage seem to be triggers. White bread doesn’t cause an issue. That's good information. Have you noticed any changes in your bowel movements recently?
PATIENT: Changes? Hmm… Yes, now that you mention it. Sometimes… it is a little loose. Not diarrhea, you understand. Just… not firm. And sometimes… it is hard. Like little stones. It changes. Not always the same. But… not normal, you see. Is that… bad?
DOCTOR: Okay, so alternating between looser stools and harder, more difficult stools. That’s helpful to know, Mr. Goodstein. It could indicate a few things. To get a more complete picture, could you tell me a little bit about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Past medical history? Well… I had the chickenpox when I was a boy. And… I broke my arm when I was ten. But… nothing serious. I have not been to the hospital for a long time. My doctor back in Hungary… he said I was very healthy. I have Medicare, you see, so I go for checkups. But they do not find anything wrong. I take a small pill for my blood pressure, but that is all.
DOCTOR: Okay, chickenpox as a child, a broken arm, generally healthy according to your previous doctor in Hungary. And you're currently taking medication for blood pressure. Do you know the name of that medication?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. Here, yes. It is… Lisinopril. One tablet every morning. It is not a problem if you do not remember. It is just a small pill. The doctor said it was to keep my heart healthy.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Goodstein. Lisinopril. And, aside from the Lisinopril, are you taking any other medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, no vitamins. No supplements. Just the Lisinopril, every morning. I do not like to take too many pills, you see. I try to eat healthy, to stay strong. But this gas… it is making me worry. It is not a normal feeling.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Goodstein. And it's good that you're mindful of not taking unnecessary medication. Now, let's talk a little bit about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… family history. My mother… she had problems with her stomach. Always complaining. But the doctor said it was… nerves. And my father… he had problems with his heart, later in life. But he smoked a lot, you see. And… my grandfather on my mother’s side, he had… something with his bowels, I think. But I do not remember exactly. It was a long time ago. Not very helpful, I am afraid. It was back in Hungary. We do not talk about these things much.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of stomach problems in your mother, heart problems in your father related to smoking, and some bowel issues in your maternal grandfather. That's helpful to know. Finally, let's discuss your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, no smoking. Never smoked. And… I do not drink alcohol. I do not like the taste. And… no drugs. Never used any. I live a quiet life, you see. I work at the burger place, I eat my dinner, I watch television. Simple things.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Goodstein. That's very helpful. Now, to get a better idea of what's going on physically, I’d like to do a quick examination. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. That is fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I want to feel better, you see. And if an examination can help… then please.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you could lie down on the examination table, that would be great. I’m going to listen to your abdomen with my stethoscope, and then I'll gently press on your belly to check for any tenderness or abnormalities. Please let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. First, let's start by listening to your bowel sounds. Your bowel sounds are… active. A little louder than I would expect, actually, but not necessarily cause for concern at this point. Now, I’m going to gently press on your abdomen. Tell me if you feel any pain or discomfort. Any pain here?
PATIENT: No… not really pain. A little… tender. There. Just a little bit. It is not sharp pain. Just… uncomfortable. Like a pressure. Is that bad?
DOCTOR: Okay, some tenderness in your lower right abdomen. That’s good information to have. It’s not a sharp pain, you said, just discomfort and pressure. I don’t feel any masses or significant abnormalities. Based on what you’ve told me, and what I’ve found during the examination, it sounds like you might be experiencing symptoms of Irritable Bowel Syndrome, or IBS. It's also possible this could be related to dietary factors or a slight sensitivity to certain foods. The tenderness in your lower right abdomen could be a sign of inflammation, which is common in IBS. However, to rule out other possibilities, I’d like to order a few simple tests. I’m going to order a complete blood count to check for any signs of infection, a stool sample to check for bacteria or parasites, and a basic metabolic panel to assess your kidney and liver function. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. If tests can help find out what is wrong… then yes, please. Complete blood count… stool sample… basic metabolic panel… whatever you need. I just want to feel better, you see. It is… unpleasant to live with this gas and the discomfort. When will I know the results? And what happens after that?
DOCTOR: Excellent. I understand your eagerness to find out what's going on. The lab usually takes about 2-3 business days to process the results. I'll call you as soon as they come back, and we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them in detail. In the meantime, I recommend keeping a food diary for the next few days. Write down everything you eat and drink, and note when you experience gas, bloating, or discomfort. This will help us identify any potential trigger foods. I also suggest trying a low-FODMAP diet for a week or two. This diet restricts certain types of carbohydrates that can be difficult to digest and can contribute to IBS symptoms. I have a handout here that explains the low-FODMAP diet in more detail. Does that sound manageable?
PATIENT: A food diary… and a low-FODMAP diet. It looks… complicated. But I will try. I want to feel better, you see. A food diary… I can do that. Write down everything I eat… It will be a little work, but… okay. And this low-FODMAP diet… I will read the handout carefully and try to follow it as best I can. So… you will call me in a few days when the test results are back? And then we will talk?
DOCTOR: Exactly. I will call you as soon as the lab results are back, usually within 2-3 business days. We can then schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results and create a personalized plan to manage your symptoms. If your symptoms worsen significantly before then – such as severe abdominal pain, fever, blood in your stool, or unintentional weight loss – please contact the clinic immediately. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: No, I think that is all. You have explained everything very clearly, Doctor. And I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me. It is… a relief to talk about it. Thank you very much. I will do the food diary, and I will try the low-FODMAP diet. And I will wait for your call. Have a good day, Doctor.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Goodstein. I'm glad I could help. Remember, we'll work through this together. Don’t hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any concerns. You have a good day as well, and I’ll be in touch soon.
