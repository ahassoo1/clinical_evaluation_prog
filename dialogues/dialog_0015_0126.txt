DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Erxleben. I'm Dr. Trestrail. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, to be frank, I’ve been awfully thirsty lately, and hungry too, even right after I’ve eaten. It’s… rather bothersome, to be honest. I was hoping you could have a look at it.
DOCTOR: Thirsty and hungry, even after eating… and how long has this been going on, Mr. Erxleben?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It started… oh, perhaps a month or so ago? It wasn't terribly noticeable at first, just a bit more water with meals. But it’s definitely gotten worse over the last couple of weeks. I find myself constantly reaching for a drink, and still feeling… not quite satisfied, if you understand.
DOCTOR: A month, progressively worsening… Okay. And besides the increased thirst and hunger, have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Other changes… not that I’ve consciously noticed, no. I suppose I’ve been a bit more tired than usual, but I put that down to… well, life, you know? Divorced life, mostly. I wouldn't say it's debilitating, just… a general lack of energy. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: “Divorced life,” as you put it… certainly can be draining. But let’s focus on the physical symptoms for now. Have you experienced any changes in your vision?
PATIENT: Vision… no, not that I’m aware of. I wear glasses, as you can see, but my prescription hasn't been changed recently. Everything seems… normal, blurry as always, but no worse than usual. I had them checked about six months ago, I believe.
DOCTOR: Alright. Any changes in your urination – frequency, amount, color?
PATIENT: Now that you mention it… yes. I’ve been going to the bathroom more often, particularly at night. And… the amount seems about the same, maybe a bit more, but I haven’t been paying terribly close attention, to be honest. Color… well, it looks normal enough. A typical pale yellow, I suppose. It’s not a particularly pleasant topic, is it?
DOCTOR: It's a necessary topic, Mr. Erxleben. These details are important. Increased frequency, especially at night… Okay. Now, let's move on to your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with diabetes, or has anyone in your family?
PATIENT: Diabetes? No, not me. And, to the best of my knowledge, no one in my immediate family has had it either. My mother had… well, heart trouble, mostly. And my father had high blood pressure, I think. But nothing about diabetes, no. I'm fairly certain, at least. My Aunt Morag was a bit of a hypochondriac, always going to the doctor, but I don't recall her ever mentioning diabetes.
DOCTOR: And are you currently taking any medications, or do you have any allergies?
PATIENT: No medications, Doctor. Nothing at all. As for allergies… I get a bit of hay fever in the spring, but that’s it. Nothing serious. No reactions to any foods or… anything, as far as I know. I’m fairly resilient, usually. I pride myself on that, actually.
DOCTOR: Very well. I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if you don’t mind. We’ll check your blood pressure, heart rate, and I’ll listen to your lungs. Then I'd like to check your feet, and perhaps a brief neurological exam. After that, I'll order some blood work to get a clearer picture of what’s going on. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly acceptable. The sooner we get to the bottom of this, the better. I appreciate you taking the time. Let’s get on with it, shall we? I have a few things I need to see to this afternoon.
DOCTOR: Please, have a seat here. We’ll start with your blood pressure. 140 over 90… slightly elevated. Pulse is 88, regular. Lungs are clear. Now, if you’ll please remove your shoes and socks… I need to examine your feet. Feet are normal, good sensation, no visible lesions. But I am noting some mild peripheral neuropathy. Now, let's do some simple reflexes… Reflexes are diminished… I’m also noting some reduced vibration sense in your lower extremities. Now, this, combined with your symptoms… is concerning. I'm ordering a comprehensive metabolic panel and a HbA1c test. We'll need to rule out diabetes. While we wait for the results, I want you to avoid sugary drinks and foods. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Diabetes? That… doesn’t sound good. No, I suppose not. No, I don’t think I do, not at the moment. How long will the results take? And… what does this mean? Do I need to… drastically change my diet immediately? I admit, I do enjoy a wee biscuit with my tea.
DOCTOR: The results should be back within 24 to 48 hours. And while we await confirmation, yes, I highly recommend minimizing sugar intake. A "wee biscuit" is precisely the sort of thing we need to avoid. It’s not about drastic changes immediately, but about being proactive. We need to see what the tests reveal, and then we can formulate a proper plan. Here is the requisition for your blood work. Please take this to the lab downstairs. They will need your insurance information. I will have the results sent directly to me, and we will schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. Do not delay this, Mr. Erxleben. And again, reduce sugar. It’s a simple precaution. Any further questions before you go?
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. Reduce sugar. I understand. No, I believe that’s all for now. Thank you for your time, and… I’ll see to the blood work immediately. I do hope it’s nothing serious.
