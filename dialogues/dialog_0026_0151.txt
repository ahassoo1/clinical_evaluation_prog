DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Teretha. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Finco. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It's nice to meet you too. Well, it’s this tingling. It's mostly in my hands and feet, you know? It’s been going on for… a little while now, I guess. Not terrible, just… annoying. And a bit worrying. I’m Teretha Uzarski, by the way.
DOCTOR: Yes, Teretha, nice to officially meet you. “Annoying and a bit worrying” – I understand. It’s good you came in to get it checked out. Now, when you say "a little while," could you give me a rough idea?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… maybe three, four months? It comes and goes, really. Sometimes it's barely noticeable, other times… well, it feels like my fingers are asleep, but they're not. Does that make sense? It’s hard to explain, honestly. And it's not always both hands and feet, sometimes just one or the other.
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense, Teretha. It sounds frustrating when it's so variable. Three to four months… alright. And it's not constant, it fluctuates. To help me understand a bit better, could you describe when you notice it more?
PATIENT: Hmm… well, I don't really notice it more at a specific time. Not like after exercise, or in the mornings, or anything. It seems to just… happen. Though, now that I think about it, maybe it's a little worse when it's cold? I’ve been doing a lot of sorting mail, you know, and the sorting room isn't always warm. But even when it’s warmer, it still happens. I don’t know…
DOCTOR: Okay, so cold might be a factor, but it doesn't seem to be the whole picture. It’s helpful that you’re thinking through those details. Now, besides the tingling, have you noticed any other symptoms alongside it?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… let me see. No, not really. No pain, no weakness. My hands aren't clumsy or anything, still manage the mail just fine. I haven’t dropped anything, thankfully! And my feet… well, I walk okay. Maybe… maybe a little tiredness sometimes, but who isn't tired these days? I don't know if that's related. Honestly, Doctor, I mostly just want to know what’s causing the tingling. It just worries me.
DOCTOR: I understand your worry, Teretha. It’s good you're able to describe things so clearly, even when it’s a bit hard to pinpoint. The fact that you haven’t noticed pain or weakness is reassuring. Now, let’s go through a bit of your medical background. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Well, I had my gallbladder out years ago. And… let me think… high blood pressure, the doctor told me. But I haven't been to a doctor regularly in… a long time. I mostly just try to keep busy, you know? I don't really have any… big problems, aside from this tingling. No diabetes, no arthritis, nothing like that. I’m a widow, you see, and… well, it’s just been me for a while now. I haven’t really needed to see a doctor much.
DOCTOR: I understand, Teretha. Taking care of yourself when you’re managing things on your own can be difficult. Okay, so gallbladder removal and high blood pressure in the past. Do you happen to know what medications you were prescribed for the high blood pressure, or if you’re still taking anything for it currently?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That's… a good question. Honestly, Doctor, I don’t remember the name of the medication. It was years ago, and… I think I stopped taking it after a while. I didn’t really like the way it made me feel. And I… well, I didn't go back for regular check-ups, so I just stopped. I know, it wasn’t very smart. I don’t take anything regularly now. Just… an aspirin now and then if I have a headache.
DOCTOR: Alright, Teretha. No medications currently, just aspirin as needed. We'll make a note of that. Now, just to be thorough, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. I eat… well, pretty much everything. I like my Ukrainian food, you know? Pierogies, borscht… all of it! No allergies, no. I don’t think. I’ve been lucky that way.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. No known allergies. Alright, Teretha. To get a better sense of what might be causing this tingling, I'd like to do a quick physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I just want to figure out what’s going on, you know? Hopefully it’s nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Excellent. First, I'm just going to check your reflexes. Could you please sit comfortably on the examination table and relax your legs?
PATIENT: Okay, yes, I can do that. Relax my legs… there we go. A little cold, this table. But that's alright. Go ahead, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Good. Your reflexes seem normal. Now, I'm going to check your sensation. I'm going to lightly touch different parts of your hands and feet with this cotton swab. Just tell me when you feel it. Okay?
PATIENT: Yes, alright. I'm ready. Just tell me when… you're touching me? That feels… fine. Normal. Everything feels… normal so far. Go ahead, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Okay. And how about here?
PATIENT: Yes, I feel that one. And that one too. Everything seems… the same, Doctor. I'm not really feeling any different. Maybe a little ticklish? But not… numb or anything. It’s hard to explain. It doesn’t feel different than usual. Like I said, sometimes it's barely noticeable.
DOCTOR: Alright. I don't see any obvious changes in your skin. I'm going to check your pulse in both your wrists and ankles. This will help us check your circulation. Your pulses feel normal on both sides. Now, I'm going to ask you to close your eyes and tell me if you can feel this when I touch your fingers. I'm just checking your ability to perceive light touch.
PATIENT: Okay, yes, I can close my eyes. Just touch my fingers… yes, I feel that. And that one too. It's… normal. Everything feels the same, Doctor. I really appreciate you checking, but I'm not sure this is telling you anything.
DOCTOR: You’re right, Teretha, everything feels perfectly normal on the exam. That's good, but it also makes figuring out the cause of the tingling a bit more challenging. Given your history of high blood pressure – even though you’re not currently taking medication – and the fact that the tingling comes and goes, I think it would be a good idea to run some blood tests. We can check your blood sugar, kidney function, and vitamin levels, as well as some thyroid markers. These tests can help us rule out some of the more common causes of peripheral neuropathy – that’s the medical term for tingling in the hands and feet. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. If it helps figure out what's going on, I'm willing to do whatever it takes. Blood tests are fine. Just… not a fan of needles, if you don't mind. But I can manage. What will happen next?
DOCTOR: Of course, I understand. Needles aren’t pleasant for many people. The phlebotomist, the person who draws the blood, is very skilled and will make it as quick and comfortable as possible. Once the blood sample is collected, it will be sent to the lab, and the results usually take a few days – typically 3 to 5 business days – to come back. Once I have the results, I'll review them carefully and contact you to discuss the findings and any necessary next steps. In the meantime, if the tingling worsens significantly, or if you develop any new symptoms – such as weakness, pain, or difficulty walking – please don't hesitate to contact the clinic immediately. Does that all sound clear?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s… clear enough. Three to five days, and call if it gets worse. And I need to call if anything else happens, like weakness. Alright. I think that's all I need to know for now, then. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very helpful, even if we haven’t figured it out yet.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Teretha. It's my pleasure. It's good you came in to get this checked out. We’ll get those tests done and hopefully have some answers soon. The nurse will come in shortly to draw your blood. Is there anything else I can help you with today before you leave?
PATIENT: No, I think that's everything. Just… hoping it’s nothing serious, you know? Thank you again, Doctor. You’ve put my mind at ease a little.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Teretha. I understand your concern, and we’ll do our best to figure things out. Remember to contact us if anything changes. Have a good day, and I’ll speak to you soon. .
