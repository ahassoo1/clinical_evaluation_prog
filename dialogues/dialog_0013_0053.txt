DOCTOR: Hi Kandy, nice to meet you. I’m Dr. Morenomartinez. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It's nice to meet you too. Well, it’s my waterworks, really. I’ve been having trouble… going to the bathroom. It’s just… difficult to start, you know? And it takes a while.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Difficulty starting your stream, and it takes a while to get going. That can definitely be frustrating. Just to get a clearer picture, how long has this been going on?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… it’s been… well, probably about three months now. Maybe a little longer. It started gradually, I didn’t really notice at first, just thought I was drinking too much tea. But it’s gotten worse lately.
DOCTOR: Okay, about three months, starting gradually. And it’s definitely worsened recently. Besides the difficulty starting, have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Hmm… well, I feel like I have to go more often, even when I haven't had much to drink. And sometimes, after I do go, it doesn’t feel like I emptied everything, you know? Like there’s still a little left in there.
DOCTOR: Okay, increased frequency and a feeling of incomplete emptying. That’s helpful to know. Do you experience any pain or burning when you urinate?
PATIENT: No, no pain, thankfully. No burning either. It's just… frustrating, the effort it takes. And worrying, you know? I don't like things not working properly.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern. No pain or burning is good. Let's talk a little more about your medical history, if you don’t mind. Do you have any past medical conditions I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think... I had my gallbladder out years ago, maybe twenty years now? And I have a bit of arthritis in my knees, but that’s managed with some cream. Nothing major, really. I had the usual childhood illnesses, measles, mumps, that sort of thing. I don't really remember much else.
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder removal about twenty years ago, and arthritis in your knees, managed with cream. That’s good to know. Any history of kidney stones or urinary tract infections?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see… I think my mother had a urinary tract infection once, a very bad one. But I haven't had one, not that I remember. I’ve been very careful, always drinking plenty of fluids. And I try to… well, I try to go to the bathroom when I need to, not hold it in.
DOCTOR: Okay, no history of UTIs for you personally, but your mother had one. And you're diligent about fluid intake and not holding it. That's good preventative care. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Just the cream for my knees, mostly. And sometimes I take a little something for my blood pressure, a small white pill. I think it’s called… Lisinopril? Yes, that’s it. And sometimes a vitamin D supplement in the winter, when there’s not much sun.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril for blood pressure and Vitamin D occasionally. Do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I've never had a bad reaction to anything, thankfully. My mother was allergic to bee stings, but that's the only allergy I know of in the family.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies for you, just your mother's bee sting allergy. Now, let's do a quick physical exam. I'll listen to your abdomen, and I'd like to do a gentle exam of your lower abdomen to check for any tenderness or abnormalities. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that's fine, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. Just be gentle, my knees aren’t what they used to be, so bending and moving around can be a bit tricky.
DOCTOR: Of course, I will be as gentle as possible. Okay, I’m listening to your abdomen now… and gently pressing here… Do you feel any pain or discomfort with this?
PATIENT: No, not really. A little… pressure, maybe, but no sharp pain. It just feels a little… strange, I suppose. Like someone is poking. But not unpleasant, not at all.
DOCTOR: Okay, no sharp pain, just a little pressure. Good. I don't feel any significant tenderness or masses. Your abdomen sounds normal. Based on what you’ve told me and the quick exam, it sounds like you might be experiencing symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia, or BPH, even though you're a woman. It's not uncommon for women to experience similar urinary symptoms as men with BPH due to changes in the urethra and bladder as we age. Your weight is a little elevated at 88 kilograms, which can sometimes contribute to these symptoms. I'd like to order a urinalysis to check for infection and a postvoid residual volume to see how much urine remains in your bladder after you urinate. That will help us rule out other causes and determine the best course of action. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Oh my! BPH? Like what men get? I didn’t know women could have that! That's… surprising. And my weight? Well, yes, I suppose I’ve put on a few pounds. But I didn't realize it was that much. A… a urinalysis and a… postvoid what-now? Yes, I suppose so. If you think it’s necessary. What exactly is a postvoid residual volume? And will it be… uncomfortable?
DOCTOR: It’s understandable to be surprised – it's not as widely discussed in women, but changes in the urethra and bladder can cause similar symptoms. A postvoid residual volume is a test where we measure the amount of urine left in your bladder after you empty it. It's a non-invasive test – you'll simply urinate as usual, and then we use a small handheld device to measure the remaining urine. It shouldn't be uncomfortable at all – it’s similar to a quick ultrasound. It helps us determine if your bladder is emptying completely. We'll also check the urinalysis for any signs of infection. I'm putting in the orders now. The lab is just down the hall, and they should be able to get you in right away. Once we have those results, we can discuss treatment options, which might include lifestyle changes, medications, or, in some cases, referral to a urologist. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds… less frightening than I thought. A quick ultrasound, you say? Good. And not a referral to a urologist right away, that’s good too. I don’t like going to specialists if I don’t have to. Lifestyle changes, I can do. Maybe I should walk more. And less tea, perhaps. Yes, that sounds alright, Doctor. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly. I appreciate that. Where exactly is the lab? And should I… prepare in any way?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome. I understand your reluctance to see specialists right away, and we’ll start with the basics. The lab is just down the hall to your left, Room 203. And no, you don't need to prepare in any way, just go as you normally would when you need to urinate. The technician will explain everything to you when you get there. They’re very nice. Here’s the requisition form – just give this to the technician. After you've had the test done, you can come back here, and we can discuss the results when they come in. Do you have any other questions before you go?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. You've been very thorough, Doctor. And kind. Room 203, to the left. And just go as usual. I can manage that. Thank you again for your help. I feel a little better just knowing what’s going on, even if it’s a strange thing for a woman to have. I'll go and get that test done, then.
DOCTOR: Okay, wonderful. You're very welcome. And don’t hesitate to come back if you have any questions or concerns after the test. Take your time, and I’ll see you shortly.
