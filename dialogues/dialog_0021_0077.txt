DOCTOR: Right. Mr. Bigger, is it?
PATIENT: Yes, that's right. Delmon Bigger. And you are…? A young doctor, eh? No offense, but you look barely old enough to drive.
DOCTOR: Jumana Havird, Doctor Havird. And experience isn't always about looking old, Mr. Bigger. Now, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Hmmph. Alright, alright. Well, the company… they sent me. Said I needed to get checked. Something about… the dust. Been working in the mine a long time, you know. They’re making a fuss now. I feel fine, though. Perfectly fine. Never had any trouble.
DOCTOR: Right. “The dust.” So, a company-mandated check-up. And you feel… no different?
PATIENT: No different at all! Strong as an ox, still. I lift heavy things every day. These young people now, they complain about everything. Back in my day, you just worked. No special checks, no complaining. Just got on with it. What are they even looking for, anyway? I don't understand all this… fuss.
DOCTOR: Well, long-term exposure to mine dust can cause… certain things. We'll need to check your lungs, just to be thorough. Have you ever had any coughs, wheezing, or shortness of breath?
PATIENT: Shortness of breath? No! Never. A little tired sometimes, maybe, but that's just from the work. Cough? Everyone coughs! Especially when the dust is bad. It's a mine, you know. Dust is part of the job. What kind of 'certain things' are you talking about, exactly? I don't like riddles. Just tell me straight.
DOCTOR: It’s not a riddle, Mr. Bigger. Prolonged dust inhalation can lead to… pneumoconiosis. Black lung disease. It’s a scarring of the lungs. Now, have you ever been diagnosed with anything lung-related?
PATIENT: Pneumo… what-now? Black lung? Sounds serious. No, never been diagnosed with anything. Doctors never had much to say to me before. Always healthy. Always working. I don’t need fancy words. Just tell me if I’m alright or not. This is wasting my time. I have things to do, you know. Black lung… is that what they are worried about?
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s just do a quick listen to your lungs, then. It won't take long. Just breathe normally. Can you sit up straight for me?
PATIENT: Fine, fine. Get it over with. Hurry now, I haven’t got all day. And be gentle, I’m an old man, you know. Don’t go poking around too much. I can feel everything.
DOCTOR: Alright. Take a deep breath in… and out… again… hmm. There's some… diminished breath sounds on the lower lobes. And a few… crackles. Have you noticed any swelling in your ankles or feet?
PATIENT: Swelling? No! Never. What do you mean, "crackles"? Like… fire? I told you, I'm fine. This is ridiculous. You're just making things up. Diminished… what-now? Is that bad? Are you trying to scare me? This is why I don't trust doctors. You always find something!
DOCTOR: It means your lungs aren’t as clear as they should be, Mr. Bigger. We need to get a chest X-ray to see what’s going on. And I’d like to check your oxygen saturation with a pulse oximeter. It's a small clip we put on your finger. This will tell us how well your lungs are delivering oxygen to your blood. Don't get yourself worked up; it's just standard procedure.
PATIENT: X-ray? Now you want to take pictures of inside me? What for? I already told you, I feel perfectly fine! Oxygen… saturation? Is that about the brain? I don't need pictures or clips or whatever you're talking about. I'm wasting my valuable time here. This company is causing me trouble for nothing. Can’t I just… sign something that says I’m okay? I don't like all this fuss and bother. And I don’t understand half of what you’re saying.
DOCTOR: Mr. Bigger, with all due respect, you are not “fine.” Your symptoms, and what I’m hearing in your lungs, warrant further investigation. I understand you don't like it, but I have a professional responsibility to assess your health accurately. The oxygen saturation is a simple test. It does not involve anything invasive. The X-ray will give us a clearer picture of your lung health, and will help determine if there's any damage. I strongly advise you to let me do these tests. It’s for your own good. If everything is normal, you can go home knowing you're healthy. But ignoring potential problems won’t make them disappear.
PATIENT: Hmph. For my own good, you say? Always "for my own good." Listen, young lady, I've lived a long life, and I know my body. I've worked hard, I've breathed dust, and I'm still standing. I don't need you telling me what's wrong with me! But… alright. If it gets you off my back… do your clip thing. But no pictures! And hurry up. Just get it over with. But if it hurts, I’m leaving.
DOCTOR: Alright. Just relax. Your oxygen saturation is… 91%. That’s below normal. I insist on getting a chest X-ray. It's the responsible thing to do, Mr. Bigger. I'm going to call the radiology department now to schedule it. It’s right downstairs, and shouldn’t take long.
PATIENT: Radiology… more people poking around. Fine! Fine, do your X-ray. But if anything happens, you're responsible. And don’t expect me to be happy about it. But I’m not going anywhere without knowing what all these fancy numbers mean. 91 percent… what does that even mean? Is that bad? Tell me straight, young lady. No more riddles!
DOCTOR: 91% means your blood isn't carrying enough oxygen. It suggests there’s something interfering with your lungs’ ability to function properly. It doesn't necessarily mean anything catastrophic, but it does require investigation. Think of it like… a car engine isn't running efficiently. We need to find out why it’s not running properly. That’s what the X-ray will help us do. Look, I understand you’re frustrated. But I'm trying to help. Once we have the results, we can discuss them and decide on the best course of action. Now, I'm going to print out a referral for the X-ray. It's just down the hall, room 203. The technician will explain everything.
PATIENT: Technician… more people. Fine, fine. Room 203, you say? Always something with these young people… always poking and prodding. Just hurry up with that paper. I haven't got all day to sit around waiting for people. And make sure that technician knows I don’t like being kept waiting!
DOCTOR: Here. Room 203. Tell them Dr. Havird sent you. And they will explain the procedure. I’ll be here when you get back to discuss the results. Go ahead. They’re expecting you. .
PATIENT: Hmph. Expecting me… as if I’m happy about all this… young people and their machines… .
