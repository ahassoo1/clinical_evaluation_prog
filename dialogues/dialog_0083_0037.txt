DOCTOR: Good morning, Mrs. Kilton. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Alanes. It’s nice to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is very nice to meet you too. I… I have been having some trouble breathing. A little bit of a wheeze, you see. It worries me some.
DOCTOR: I understand. Trouble breathing and a wheeze… that’s certainly something we should investigate. Could you tell me a little more about when this started?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It started… maybe a week ago? It was not so bad at first. Just a little bit of coughing. But now… now it feels like my chest is tight. And the wheezing… it happens when I walk, mostly. Or when I try to do my exercises. I like to keep active, you see.
DOCTOR: That’s good that you’re staying active, Mrs. Kilton. It's important to maintain that when you can. And it's helpful to know it's been progressing over a week, and is related to exertion. When you say “tight,” can you describe that sensation?
PATIENT: It is like… a band around my chest. Not painful, exactly. Just… hard to get a good breath. Like someone is squeezing it. And it makes me a little bit dizzy sometimes when I push myself too hard. Is that… is that normal? I do not want to worry you.
DOCTOR: It’s good you’re telling me all of this, Mrs. Kilton, and it doesn't sound like anything to dismiss. The sensation of tightness and the dizziness are important details. Have you noticed any fever, chills, or cough with any mucus?
PATIENT: No fever, no. And no chills. I have been coughing, yes. But not much… and the mucus… it is clear. Not much color to it. Just… a little bit of a tickle in my throat sometimes. Mostly just the wheezing and the tight chest. I used to be very strong, you see. I worry this is… a sign of getting old.
DOCTOR: It’s admirable that you’ve stayed active, and it’s common to experience changes as we age, but that doesn't necessarily explain what’s happening. Let’s gather a bit more information. Have you noticed anything that makes the wheezing or tightness worse?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. Dust, maybe? When I am cleaning, it seems to bother it more. And… when it is very humid, like yesterday. The air felt very heavy, and it was harder to breathe. Also, my grandson, he has a cold right now. I hold him, you see. I wonder… could it be from him?
DOCTOR: That’s helpful to know. Dust and humidity can certainly be triggers. And exposure to your grandson with a cold is also important. Now, have you had any history of asthma, bronchitis, or pneumonia in the past?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I have not. I was always a very healthy woman. I did have some trouble with my heart many years ago, but the doctors said it was fixed. A long time ago. Is that… will that affect it? I do not remember the details very well. It was before my divorce, you see. A very difficult time.
DOCTOR: Thank you for letting me know. We will certainly take that into consideration. Just to be thorough, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, I do not think so. I take a small pill for my blood pressure, but that is all. The doctor said I was not allergic to it. I do not have any trouble with food either. I like many things! Spicy food, mostly. But I do not think I have any allergies, no.
DOCTOR: Good. And how about your smoking history?
PATIENT: Oh, no smoking! Never touched a cigarette in my life. My husband, he smoked. It was one of the reasons… well, never mind. But I do not smoke. Never have, never will. It is very bad for you, you see.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent. Now, Mrs. Kilton, I'd like to listen to your lungs and check your heart rate and blood pressure. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That is fine. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mrs. Kilton, take a deep breath in… and out… again… good. I am hearing some wheezing in your lungs, as you described, and a slight decrease in air movement on both sides. Your heart rate is a little elevated, and your blood pressure is slightly high, but not critically so. Your oxygen saturation is 94%, which is acceptable, but we want to keep that closer to 95% or higher.
PATIENT: Oh dear. Is that… bad, Doctor? The heart rate and blood pressure? I do try to stay calm, you see. I do not like to worry. But the wheezing… is that something serious? Perhaps it is just old age catching up with me.
DOCTOR: It's understandable to be concerned, Mrs. Kilton, and I appreciate you telling me how you're feeling. While your heart rate and blood pressure are slightly elevated, it could be due to the difficulty you're experiencing breathing. The wheezing is something we need to investigate further. It suggests some narrowing of the airways. It's not necessarily "just old age," although changes are expected over time. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to order a chest X-ray to rule out any infection, like pneumonia, or other lung issues. I’d also like to do a simple spirometry test, which measures how much air you can breathe in and out. This will help us determine if there is any obstruction in your airways, such as asthma or COPD. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: X-ray and… spirometry? Oh dear. Are those… painful, Doctor? I do not like needles. And I worry about being… trapped in a small space. I had a difficult time with my grandson’s birthday party. Too many people, you see. And the room was very small. Is there another way? I just want to feel better. Is the wheezing… dangerous?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mrs. Kilton. Let's address those one by one. The chest X-ray does involve a small amount of radiation, but it's a very low dose and the benefits of ruling out serious issues outweigh the risks. It’s quick and painless – you simply stand or sit while the machine takes a picture. The spirometry test involves breathing into a mouthpiece, like blowing into a straw. It doesn't involve any needles, and you control the breathing – it's not forced. We can take breaks if you feel anxious at any time. Regarding the wheezing, it can be a sign of more serious conditions, like asthma or COPD, but it can also be caused by less serious things, like a temporary infection. That's why it's important to get it checked out. The tests will help us determine the cause and create a plan to help you breathe easier. If you are truly uncomfortable with either of those tests, we can start with some medication to see if it helps your symptoms, but it is harder to get a definitive diagnosis without imaging and lung function testing. Would you like me to explain the medication options?
PATIENT: Medication sounds… less frightening. What kind of medication, Doctor? Is it… something I have to take forever? And will it make me sleepy? I like to be active, you see. I do not want to be stuck in a chair all day. Perhaps… perhaps we can try that first. The medication. And then… then maybe we can think about the other things. If I am not feeling better.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mrs. Kilton. That's a perfectly reasonable approach. We can absolutely start with medication. I was thinking we could try an inhaler, specifically a bronchodilator. It helps to open up the airways and make it easier to breathe. It's not something you would necessarily need to take forever – we can assess how you respond to it and adjust the plan accordingly. Some people experience mild side effects like a slightly racing heart or jitters, but those are usually temporary. We can start with a low dose and see how you tolerate it. If you find it makes you too uncomfortable, we can explore other options. I will write you a prescription for albuterol, a common bronchodilator. You’ll use it as needed when you feel short of breath or wheezing. I'll also give you instructions on how to use it properly. I also want to prescribe a short course of oral prednisone, a steroid, to help reduce inflammation in your airways. We will use it for 5 days, and that should help to reduce the wheezing. Would that be acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… much better. Albuterol and… prednisone. Five days. As needed. I can manage that. Will the pharmacy know I am a new patient? I do not want any confusion. And… is there anything I should avoid while taking those medications? Spicy food, perhaps? I do like my curry.
DOCTOR: Yes, I will send the prescriptions electronically to your pharmacy, and they will be flagged as a new patient prescription, so there shouldn't be any confusion. Regarding restrictions, there are a few things. With albuterol, it can sometimes cause tremors or a racing heart, so if you experience those, reduce the frequency of use and let me know. Prednisone can sometimes cause insomnia or increased appetite, but these are usually temporary and mild. As for spicy food, there's no direct interaction with either medication. You can continue to enjoy your curry, Mrs. Kilton! However, if you find it makes your symptoms worse, it might be something to consider reducing temporarily. I'm going to give you a written summary of these instructions, including potential side effects and how to use the inhaler correctly. We will schedule a follow-up appointment in one week to assess your progress. If your symptoms worsen significantly before then, please contact the office immediately. Does that all sound clear?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds very clear. One week follow-up. And contact the office if things get worse. I have written it down in my notebook, just to be sure. Thank you for being so patient with me. And for not pushing me to do things I was uncomfortable with. You are a very kind doctor. I think that is all, yes?
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Mrs. Kilton. It’s my pleasure. My goal is always to make you feel comfortable and confident in your care. And it's perfectly okay to take things at your own pace. Yes, I believe that is all for today. The nurse will come in shortly to go over discharge instructions with you and schedule your follow-up appointment. Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns after you leave. Get some rest, and I look forward to seeing you next week. And enjoy your curry!
PATIENT: .
DOCTOR: Goodbye, Mrs. Kilton. Take care.
