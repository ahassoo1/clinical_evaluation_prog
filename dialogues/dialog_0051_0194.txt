DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Mayhaugh. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Glazewski. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s… nice to meet you as well. Well, it’s my ears, mostly. They’ve been acting up. And… my family. There’s a history, you see. But honestly, it’s all a bit fuzzy. It comes and goes, this… trouble.
DOCTOR: Okay, ears and a family history. "Fuzzy" is alright, we can take things slowly. Let’s start with your ears. Can you describe what's been happening with them?
PATIENT: It’s hard to explain. Sometimes… everything just goes quiet. Like someone turned off the volume. And then… I get really dizzy. Not always, but often. It doesn’t last long, usually. Just… a spell. Then it comes back. The hearing, I mean. It’s… unsettling, to be quiet like that. And then the room starts spinning. I don’t know why it happens.
DOCTOR: Okay, so intermittent hearing loss and dizziness. And you said it comes and goes?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. Comes and goes. It’s not… constant. Sometimes weeks go by and I don’t even notice. Then, suddenly… whoosh. Gone. Then it’s back again. It’s… unpredictable. It makes it hard to… well, to do things. To talk on the phone, mostly. And I don’t like driving when I feel it coming on.
DOCTOR: Alright. And is there anything that seems to trigger these episodes?
PATIENT: Trigger…? Hmm. That’s a good question. I don’t think so… not that I’ve noticed. I used to think maybe stress, but… I’m always a little stressed, to be honest. Being a widow will do that to you. No, I don't think there's anything specific. It just… happens. Sometimes when I bend over, maybe? But I can’t be sure. It’s all a bit of a blur, you see.
DOCTOR: Okay, no clear triggers, and potentially worsened with bending over. Let’s talk a bit about this family history you mentioned. You said there is a history?
PATIENT: Yes… my mother had it. Terrible trouble with her ears, always. And my brother, too, before he… well, before he passed. They both had spells, just like me. Dizzy spells and the hearing going. The doctors… they didn’t really know what it was, back then. It was a long time ago. They just said it was something… in the ears. Something inherited, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of similar symptoms in both your mother and brother. That is helpful information. Do you recall if they ever received a specific diagnosis, even if it was a long time ago?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. It was a long time ago, like I said. They just… lived with it. My mother used to say it was her “inner ear,” but… she didn’t really understand it either. The doctors did some tests, I think, but they didn't explain much. It wasn’t like it is now, with all the fancy machines. They just told her to avoid loud noises and try to stay calm. It didn’t help much, though.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, let’s do a quick examination of your ears and do some basic balance testing. It will help me get a better idea of what might be going on. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, alright. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just… I'd like to get to the bottom of this, if we can. It's been going on for so long. I hope it’s not too much trouble.
DOCTOR: Not at all. It's my job. Let's start with your ears. I'm going to use an otoscope to look inside and see if there's anything obvious going on. It might be a little uncomfortable, but it shouldn't hurt. Okay… I see a little bit of cerumen – that’s earwax – but nothing that immediately stands out. The ear drums look intact. Now, let's check your balance. Could you please stand up for me?
PATIENT: Alright, I'm standing. Be careful with me, Doctor. I'm not as steady as I used to be. What do you want me to do?
DOCTOR: Alright, just stand still for a moment. I'm going to see if you sway. Please try to keep your eyes open. Okay, a little bit of sway, particularly to your left. Now, I'm going to have you close your eyes. Just close them tightly when you're ready. Okay, with your eyes closed, the sway is more noticeable. That suggests there may be a vestibular component to this. Now, let’s try a simple Romberg test. Can you put one foot directly in front of the other, like you're walking a tightrope?
PATIENT: Alright, eyes closed… oh dear. Oh, Doctor, I’m not very good at this! I feel like I’m going to fall. It’s… difficult. I don’t like this.
DOCTOR: It's alright, it's alright. You're doing fine. Just hold still for a moment. Okay, that's enough for now. You did very well. Based on this quick examination, it seems like there’s a possibility of a vestibular issue – that’s the part of your inner ear that controls balance. The sway, especially with your eyes closed, suggests that. The history of hearing loss and similar symptoms in your family further supports this. Now, to get a clearer picture, I’d like to order some further testing. An audiogram to assess your hearing, and a VNG – videonystagmography – to evaluate your vestibular function. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Testing… alright. Yes, that sounds… sensible. Anything to figure out what’s going on. What does this… VNG thing involve? And how long will it take? I have a bit of a schedule, you see. Not important, but… I like to know.
DOCTOR: Certainly. The VNG – it's a non-invasive test. Basically, it involves wearing some goggles and having sensors attached to your head. We’ll have you look in different directions while we monitor your eye movements. It tells us how your inner ear is functioning. It doesn’t hurt, but it can sometimes make people a little dizzy. It usually takes about an hour to complete. As for your schedule, we can try to accommodate you. The clinic usually has appointments available within the next week or so. Would that work for you?
PATIENT: An hour… alright. And it might make me dizzy? Oh dear. But yes, within the next week would be good, if possible. The sooner the better, really. Is there anything I should do to prepare for it? Or anything I should avoid?
DOCTOR: Good question. Just avoid caffeine and alcohol for about 24 hours before the test. Also, if you wear contacts, it’s best to wear your glasses instead. And it’s helpful to have someone drive you to and from the appointment, just in case you feel a little unsteady afterwards. Otherwise, just come as you are. I’ll have the receptionist schedule you for the VNG and audiogram. She’ll also give you a form to fill out with your medication list and any allergies. Once we have the results, we can discuss them and come up with a plan. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… good. Medication list and allergies… alright, I can do that. And someone to drive me… yes, my neighbor, Mrs. Peterson, she’s very kind. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very helpful. I appreciate you taking the time to listen. I think… I think that’s all for now, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Mayhaugh. It was my pleasure. And you’re right, I think that's everything for today. The receptionist will be right with you to schedule those tests. Please don't hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or concerns before your appointment. And remember, if you experience any sudden worsening of your symptoms, such as severe dizziness or hearing loss, please go to the emergency room immediately. It was nice meeting you. Take care.
PATIENT: Thank you again, Doctor Glazewski. You too. And I will, I promise. I’ll let you know how it goes.
