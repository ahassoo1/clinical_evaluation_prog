DOCTOR: Hi Helaina, welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Ranjan. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, to be honest, a friend of mine suggested I come talk to someone about… about preventing HIV. She said there’s a pill you can take, and I thought I should look into it. I don't want to mess around with that stuff, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s a really smart thing to be proactive about, Helaina. It’s excellent that you’re thinking about prevention. Your friend is right – there is a pill you can take to significantly reduce your risk of HIV. It’s called PrEP – pre-exposure prophylaxis. Before we talk more about that, and to make sure it’s the right option for you, I’d like to ask you a few questions, if that’s alright. Just some general health questions to get a better understanding of your situation. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly fine, Doctor. Ask away. I'm pretty open, so don't hesitate. I just… I’m hoping this can be quick, if you don’t mind. I have a bit of a long day ahead.
DOCTOR: Of course, I'll do my best to be efficient. Let's start with your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No, nothing major. I had a bit of trouble with my back a few years ago, but that’s been sorted out with physiotherapy. Oh, and I wear glasses, if that counts! But no serious illnesses, Doctor, honestly. I’ve been pretty lucky, I think. Medicare keeps an up-to-date record, if you need to check.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. Back pain and needing glasses don’t usually factor into this, but it’s good to know. And yes, I can certainly take a look at your Medicare record to confirm. Just pulling up your information now… Okay, I see no major medical conditions listed here. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, never. Not a single one, thankfully. I’ve always been careful, and, like I said, pretty lucky. I avoid things that might need surgery if I can help it! Is this pill… is it a big surgery-type thing? I'm getting a little worried now.
DOCTOR: Oh, no, not at all! It’s absolutely not a surgery. It’s a small pill you take every day, that’s it. No procedures involved. I just want to be thorough and make sure it’s safe for you. Now, thinking about your family… are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – like heart disease, cancer, diabetes, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, okay, good. A pill is fine. Surgery would be… no. Right. My family… let me see. My mother had high blood pressure, I think, when she got older. And my grandfather, on my father’s side, he had diabetes. But that's about it, really. Nothing too serious, as far as I know. We weren’t a family that talked a lot about health, if I’m honest. More about the food!
DOCTOR: That’s helpful to know. High blood pressure and diabetes are good things to be aware of. Okay, and just to cover all bases, have you ever been tested for HIV before?
PATIENT: Yes, I have. I had a test, oh, maybe five years ago? It was all clear, thankfully. My doctor at the time suggested it, just as a routine thing. I don't… I don’t really have a lot of risk factors, if that makes sense. I’ve been single for a long time, and I’m careful. But this friend of mine… she said even careful people should consider this pill, just to be extra safe. It’s better to be cautious, I suppose.
DOCTOR: You're absolutely right – it is better to be cautious, and your friend is giving you good advice. Even with low risk, PrEP can provide extra peace of mind. Now, I'm going to ask a few questions about your social history, if you don't mind. This is just to get a complete picture. Do you currently have any sexual partners?
PATIENT: Oh. Right. Well… no, not at the moment. I haven't been with anyone regularly for… a very long time. It's not something I discuss often, Doctor. It's a bit personal. I just… I work a lot, and I haven't really been focused on that part of my life. Does that answer your question? I hope you don't mind me being a bit vague.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. That’s perfectly fine, Helaina. No need to share anything you’re not comfortable with. Knowing that you aren't currently sexually active is enough information for now. Do you use any tobacco products, or drink alcohol regularly?
PATIENT: No, no tobacco. Never touched it. And I have a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, maybe two or three times a week. Nothing excessive, Doctor. I’m not a big drinker. Just a little something to relax with. It’s usually a red wine, if that matters.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. So, just to clarify, you have no known allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: No, none at all. I’ve been lucky there too. I can take most things without any problems. I’ve had the usual childhood vaccinations, of course, but no serious allergic reactions to anything. I remember being a bit sniffly after a flu shot once, but that was it. Really, I’m a pretty straightforward case, Doctor. I hope this isn’t taking too long.
DOCTOR: No, not at all. You are pretty straightforward, which is good! Okay, everything looks good so far. Now, before we discuss PrEP in detail, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, just to make sure there are no underlying health concerns. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh. A physical exam? Now? I didn’t expect that. Is it… necessary? I just wanted to talk about the pill. I’m not really dressed for an exam, if I'm honest. And I have to get back to work later…
DOCTOR: You're right to ask. It's a standard part of the process before starting PrEP, just to make sure it’s safe for you and that there aren’t any contraindications. It’s a very basic exam – I’ll check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and do a quick visual assessment. It won't be anything invasive, I promise. We can absolutely skip it if you’re very uncomfortable, but it really does help me make the best recommendation for your health. It should only take a few minutes. If it helps, you don’t need to undress, we can keep your clothes on for most of it.
PATIENT: Oh… well, if it’s really necessary… and I can keep my clothes on… I suppose that’s alright. But please, be quick. And gentle. I don’t like doctors very much, if I’m honest. They always seem to find something wrong with me, even when I feel fine.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, I understand. We’ll take it very slow and gentle, and I’ll explain everything as we go. I promise to be as efficient as possible. If you could just have a seat here, we’ll start with your blood pressure. Just relax, and let me know if you feel uncomfortable at any point. First, I’m just going to wrap this cuff around your arm…
