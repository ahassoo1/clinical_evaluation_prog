DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Nini. I'm Dr. Pipkorn. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, please tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, dear. Dr. Pipkorn, you say? It's… lovely to meet you as well. Let me see… what did bring me in? Ah, yes! It’s about my blood. My… someone mentioned I should know my blood type. Just in case, you know? Old age makes you think of these things. I don't recall why exactly, but it seems important.
DOCTOR: I see. So, you’re requesting to have your blood type determined as a preventative measure, essentially?
PATIENT: Preventative… yes, that sounds right. It’s… a good thing to know, isn't it? I used to work with… ropes, big ropes. Rigging, they called it. Lots of heights. Maybe that's what it was for? I don't rightly remember needing to know it then, but… it feels important now. Is it a big deal to find out? Will it take long?
DOCTOR: It’s not a particularly complex procedure, Ms. Nini, though it isn’t typically something done without a clear medical indication. Knowing your blood type can be useful in certain situations, certainly, but it's not a standard part of routine care. We can certainly proceed if you wish, it will involve a simple blood draw. However, I must ask – has anything specific prompted this request?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. A blood draw? Not my favorite thing, I must confess. But… if it’s important, then alright. No, nothing specific. Honestly, I'm a bit hazy on things these days. My grandson, maybe? He might have said something. He's a very sensible boy. He worries, you see. He probably just thought it was a good idea. I don't recall any incident or anything that would make me think of it, though. Just… a feeling. Is that silly?
DOCTOR: It isn’t silly at all, Ms. Nini. Sometimes a feeling is enough to warrant investigation. However, to ensure we’re proceeding appropriately, let me ask a few questions regarding your medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you ever been hospitalized for any reason?
PATIENT: Hospitalized… hmm. Let me think. There was… a fall, a long time ago. When I was still working, actually. Rigging is dangerous, you know. I broke my wrist, I believe. But that was… goodness, probably fifty years ago? And… there was a bout of the flu, a bad one, back in the seventies, I think. Other than that… I can’t rightly recall any long stays. Just the usual bumps and bruises. Does a broken wrist count? It was a long time ago, and they didn’t do much for it back then, just a cast, I think.
DOCTOR: Yes, that is helpful, Ms. Nini. And have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… oh, dear. Now that’s a tricky one. I believe… yes. My gallbladder, I think. A long, long time ago. Before my husband passed. I remember the recovery was quite unpleasant, but… everything else is a bit of a blur. It was in a small hospital, not a fancy one. And… was there anything else? I honestly can't be sure. My memory isn't what it used to be, you know. It's like trying to grasp smoke. Perhaps I had my appendix out? I really can't say for certain. It was so long ago.
DOCTOR: Very well. And what about medications?
PATIENT: Oh, medications… let me see. I take something for my blood pressure, I think. A little white pill. And… something for my arthritis. My knees, you know. They ache something awful in the cold. But the names… they slip my mind. I have a little box at home, with all the pills. My grandson helps me keep track. He’s very good at that sort of thing. I really couldn’t tell you what they are, just that I take them regularly. Is that helpful? I apologize for being so… vague. It’s just how old age treats you, I suppose.
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Ms. Nini. We can certainly obtain a list of your current medications from your pharmacy. That would be the most accurate way to proceed. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else, such as food or latex?
PATIENT: Oh, that's a good idea! My grandson would know the pharmacy, I’m sure. He handles all that. Allergies… hmm. Not that I know of. I used to get hives as a child, but I haven't had those in… decades. And no, I don't think I'm allergic to anything specific. I eat most things. Latex… I don't recall ever having a problem with that. Gloves, you mean? I suppose I haven’t spent much time thinking about it. But I don't think so. Honestly, I'm usually just grateful someone is helping me! Is it bad that I don't remember all these things? It feels like my head is full of cotton wool.
DOCTOR: It’s not uncommon for memory to become less reliable with age, Ms. Nini. Now, to return to your initial request – determining your blood type. While I understand your desire to have this information, without a clear medical indication, it is not a standard procedure. However, given your concerns, we can proceed with a blood draw. I will also order a complete blood count to assess your overall health. Does that sound agreeable to you?
PATIENT: A complete blood count… that sounds sensible. If it will make you feel better, dear, then yes, let’s do it. A blood draw… ugh. But alright. If it's important. And you think it’s best. Just… be gentle, alright? I don't have the strongest veins, you know. And please, tell my grandson. He worries so. What’s his number? I always forget. He’s… a good boy. A very good boy.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Nini. I'll make a note of that. And if you could provide me with your grandson's number, I will be sure to contact him after the results are available. We’ll send a phlebotomist in to draw your blood. It should only take a few minutes. Do you have any questions for me before they arrive?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. Just… thank you, dear. For being patient with me. And for not making me feel silly for not remembering everything. It's… a comfort to know someone is taking care of me. My husband… he always took care of me. Oh, but that was a long time ago. His number… let me see… it's… 555-123-4567. Yes, that’s it. 555-123-4567. Please tell him I said hello. And thank you again. You’ve been very kind.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Nini. I’ll be sure to pass along your regards to your grandson. I’ll leave you to rest for a moment. The phlebotomist should be with you shortly.
