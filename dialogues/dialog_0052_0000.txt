DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Firestone. My name is Dr. Patricia Shely. It’s a pleasure to meet you. I see you’re here today. Could you tell me what brings you in?
PATIENT: Well, good morning to you too, Doctor. Honestly, it’s rather inconvenient having to come in for this. It’s just… my legs. They feel like jelly, practically. It started a few days ago, right after I got over a nasty cold. Not a pleasant experience, getting a cold in August, I must say. It’s just… weak. Both of them. It’s slowing me down, and you know, my job requires a lot of walking.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's certainly frustrating to have something slowing you down, especially when your work depends on being active. And you’re right, a cold in August is unusual. So, let’s focus on these legs. You said the weakness started a few days after your cold resolved. Could you describe the weakness in more detail?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s not like I can’t walk, Doctor. Don’t misunderstand. It's just…effort. Like wading through mud, almost. And it's both legs, equally. It's not a sharp pain, not a tingling, just…heavy. Like they weigh a ton. And I find myself having to concentrate on lifting each foot, which is ridiculous. A person shouldn’t have to think about walking, should they? It’s… unbecoming.
DOCTOR: You’re describing it very clearly, Ms. Firestone. It sounds like a significant effort to walk, and that concentration you’re needing is certainly concerning. The fact that it's both legs equally is also helpful information. Now, to get a better understanding, could you tell me if this weakness came on suddenly, or did it develop gradually over those few days after your cold?
PATIENT: Suddenly. Quite suddenly, actually. One day I was fine—well, as fine as one can be during a cold—and the next I felt like I’d run a marathon. I woke up, got out of bed, and…whoosh. Like someone had taken the air out of my tires, if you’ll pardon the expression. It wasn’t a slow decline, it just was. A rather dramatic change, really.
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful, Ms. Firestone. A sudden onset like that is important to note. And "like the air out of your tires" is a very descriptive way to put it – I appreciate that. Now, let's move on to some other questions to build a complete picture. Have you experienced any fever, chills, or body aches along with this leg weakness?
PATIENT: Oh, the cold did give me a bit of a fever, yes. Nothing terribly high, mind you—I don’t bother with thermometers for every little sniffle—but I was definitely warm to the touch. And a few aches, naturally. That’s what colds do. But all of that—the sniffles, the cough, the little fever—that was gone before the legs started acting up. Completely gone. I felt like I was on the mend, and then…this. It's just the legs now.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know – the fever and body aches resolved before the leg weakness started. It helps us narrow down the possibilities. Now, have you noticed any changes in your bowel or bladder habits?
PATIENT: Goodness, Doctor, are you asking if I’ve… lost control of myself? I assure you, that hasn’t happened. Everything is quite… regular, if you must know. I’ve always been rather particular about my diet, you see. And I certainly haven’t had any accidents, if that’s what you’re implying. It’s rather insulting, actually, to suggest such a thing.
DOCTOR: I apologize, Ms. Firestone. That was not my intention at all. Those are standard questions to assess a broad range of potential causes. I understand your discomfort, and I assure you, I wasn't implying anything. Let's move on. Have you noticed any numbness, tingling, or shooting pain in your legs or feet?
PATIENT: Well, I suppose I can forgive a bit of clumsiness with the questions, Doctor. But really, standard questions should be… more delicately phrased. As for the numbness… no. Nothing like that. There’s no tingling, no shooting pain. It’s just… weakness. A heavy, clumsy feeling. Like walking through molasses, I told you. It's simply exhausting, and frankly, quite undignified for a tour guide. People expect a certain… agility, you know?
DOCTOR: I appreciate your patience, Ms. Firestone, and I’ll certainly be more mindful of my phrasing going forward. It’s important to me that you feel comfortable and respected during this consultation. "Walking through molasses" is a very helpful description. Now, I'd like to ask about your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, such as diabetes, high blood pressure, or arthritis?
PATIENT: Oh, let’s see. My doctor—Dr. Alvarez, back in Honduras—always said I had excellent health, for my age. I take very good care of myself. High blood pressure? No, never. Diabetes? Absolutely not. I watch my sugar intake very carefully. Arthritis… well, a bit of stiffness now and then, as one gets older, but nothing diagnosed. Nothing that required any medication, certainly. I had a rather nasty bout of bronchitis a few years back, but that’s about it. I had a hysterectomy at 38, but that was… many years ago.
DOCTOR: Thank you for that information, Ms. Firestone. So, no diagnosed diabetes or high blood pressure, and a hysterectomy many years ago. And just to be thorough, are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a daily multivitamin, Doctor. A basic one. Nothing fancy. And occasionally, if I’m feeling a bit run down, I’ll take some Vitamin C. But that's about it. I don't believe in loading up on pills unless absolutely necessary. Natural is best, you see. My grandmother—she lived to be 98—swore by herbal teas and a healthy diet.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Ms. Firestone. Multivitamin and occasional Vitamin C. Now, regarding your family history, are there any medical conditions that run in your family, such as heart disease, stroke, diabetes, or neurological disorders?
PATIENT: Well, my mother, God rest her soul, had a touch of high blood pressure towards the end of her life, but she lived a long and active life despite it. My father, he was a strong man, but he had some problems with his heart in his later years. Nothing spectacular, though. Just the usual aches and pains of getting old, I suppose. And my aunt… she had some nerve problems, I believe. Something with her hands and feet, but I never paid much attention to the details. Women don't talk about such things, you know. It's considered…unladylike.
DOCTOR: I understand. So, a history of high blood pressure and heart problems in your parents, and some nerve problems in an aunt. Now, can you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle? Well, I work, Doctor. As a tour guide, I'm on my feet all day. It’s a demanding job, certainly. I eat reasonably well—I try to avoid too much sugar and fried food—and I get plenty of fresh air. I used to dance, quite a lot, but…after the divorce, I lost interest. It was something I enjoyed with my husband, you see. Now, I mostly just…walk. And I complain, naturally. It's a habit.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Ms. Firestone. It's helpful to understand your daily activities and overall habits. Now, before we move on to a physical examination, let’s review your allergies. Do you have any known allergies to medications, foods, or environmental factors?
PATIENT: Allergies? Heavens, no. I'm remarkably resilient, you see. I can eat anything, and I've never had a problem with pollen or dust or anything of the sort. I even used to handle tropical plants back in Honduras—all sorts of exotic blooms—without a single sniffle. Perhaps it’s the strong Honduran blood, you know. We're a hardy people. I’m quite proud of my heritage, actually.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent to know, Ms. Firestone. No known allergies. Okay. Thank you for providing that information. It’s very helpful. Now, I’d like to conduct a quick physical exam to get a better understanding of what’s going on. I'll check your vital signs, reflexes, strength, and sensation in your legs and feet. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Well, as long as it’s quick, Doctor. I have a tour scheduled for this afternoon, you see, and I can’t afford to be delayed too long. I do apologize if I seem…impatient. It’s just that my clients expect a certain level of efficiency, and I try my best to accommodate them. But yes, go ahead. I suppose a quick examination is necessary, if you insist. Just please be gentle. I bruise easily, you know.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Firestone. I will be as gentle as possible. And I understand your schedule; we'll keep it brief. Alright. Your vital signs are within normal limits. Now, if you could sit on the examination table, please. I'm going to check your reflexes in your legs. Okay. Your reflexes are normal, and you have good strength in your legs, though you do seem to tire easily with prolonged exertion. Now, I'm going to check your sensation in your feet. I'll be lightly touching these areas with this instrument. Please tell me when you feel it. Your sensation is good in both feet. I don’t notice any obvious abnormalities on the physical exam, but the fatigue with effort is concerning.
PATIENT: Well, that wasn't so bad, Doctor. Though, honestly, I could have told you all of that myself. I know my own body, you see. The fatigue… yes, that's exactly what I've been experiencing. It's just… draining. Like walking through molasses, all over again. Is there anything…serious going on? You make it sound so clinical, all this checking and prodding. Is it my nerves? Or something with my circulation? I hope it's not something dreadful. I simply cannot afford to be ill.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Firestone. And you’re right to be proactive about your health. While you do have good awareness of your body, a physical examination and thorough history help us rule out potential causes and arrive at the most accurate diagnosis. Based on your history and examination, the fatigue with effort, and the lack of neurological deficits, several possibilities could be contributing to your symptoms. While it's not possible to give you a definitive diagnosis at this point without further testing, some possibilities include post-viral fatigue, muscle weakness related to deconditioning, or early signs of peripheral neuropathy. We'll need to rule out other more serious conditions, just to be safe. I would like to order some blood work. This will include a complete blood count, electrolytes, kidney and liver function tests, vitamin D level, and thyroid stimulating hormone. We may also consider checking for Lyme disease and other inflammatory markers, given the possibility of a recent viral illness. Additionally, I'd like to schedule a nerve conduction study to evaluate the function of your nerves. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Blood work and a nerve conduction study? That sounds…extensive. And rather inconvenient. But… I suppose if it’s necessary. I really don’t have time for a lot of running around, Doctor. My schedule is quite full, you see. Could we perhaps expedite these tests? And will the nerve conduction study be…painful? I’ve heard dreadful things about those things. And what if it is something serious? My mother… she had some heart problems, as I mentioned. I wouldn't want to end up like her, bedridden and helpless. Just tell me straight, Doctor. Is it likely to be something dreadful?
DOCTOR: I understand your anxieties, Ms. Firestone, and I’ll do my best to address them. The blood work is relatively straightforward and can be done at any local lab. I’ll provide you with the necessary requisitions, and you can schedule an appointment at your convenience. The nerve conduction study can be mildly uncomfortable, but it’s not usually painful. Small electrodes are placed on the skin, and brief electrical impulses are used to assess nerve function. It’s a bit like a mild static shock. The technician will minimize any discomfort, and it only takes about 30-45 minutes. Regarding your concerns about something serious, it’s important to remember that we are still in the early stages of investigation. While your symptoms are concerning, they are not necessarily indicative of a severe condition. The blood work and nerve conduction study will help us rule out more serious possibilities, such as nerve damage, electrolyte imbalances, or underlying inflammatory conditions. I want to be upfront with you. There is a small possibility of a more serious underlying condition, but it’s far more likely that your symptoms are related to post-viral fatigue or muscle weakness. We’ll proceed with these tests to get a clear understanding of what’s going on, and I’ll discuss the results with you in detail as soon as they become available. I will also provide you with a prescription for a multivitamin with B vitamins to support nerve health. In the meantime, I recommend continuing to rest, staying hydrated, and avoiding strenuous activity. Do you have any other questions or concerns that I can address at this time?
PATIENT: B vitamins, you say? My grandmother always swore by those. Perhaps you’re right about the fatigue, then. It was a particularly nasty cold. But honestly, Doctor, this is all rather…disruptive. I have clients expecting me, tours to lead. I simply cannot afford to be laid up for weeks. And what if the nerve conduction study is… abnormal? What then? Surgery? Injections? I’ve heard dreadful things. I suppose the blood work is unavoidable, but please, expedite the nerve conduction study as much as possible. And tell me honestly, Doctor. What is the worst-case scenario? I need to be prepared. I don’t like surprises.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns completely, Ms. Firestone. Let’s address your questions directly. If the nerve conduction study is abnormal, it would help us determine the extent and location of any nerve damage. This doesn't automatically mean surgery or injections. Often, mild nerve damage can be managed with conservative treatments like physical therapy, pain management, and lifestyle modifications. In some cases, more severe nerve damage may require further intervention, such as injections or, rarely, surgery. However, that is far from a certainty, and we would discuss all available options with you in detail if that were to become necessary. Regarding the worst-case scenario, it’s important to be realistic but also avoid unnecessary alarm. The most concerning possibility, though unlikely given your presentation, would be a progressive neurological condition affecting your nerves. However, that would be accompanied by other symptoms, such as significant muscle weakness, numbness, or difficulty with coordination, which you have not reported. It's far more likely that your symptoms are related to post-viral fatigue or muscle weakness, and these conditions are usually treatable with conservative measures. The blood work and nerve conduction study will help us confirm this and develop a tailored treatment plan for you. I will put in a rush order for the blood work and contact the local neurology department to expedite the nerve conduction study. I’ll also give you a detailed handout outlining the symptoms to watch out for, and I want you to contact me immediately if you experience any new or worsening symptoms, such as severe weakness, numbness, difficulty breathing, or changes in your bowel or bladder function. In the meantime, continue to rest, stay hydrated, and take the multivitamin with B vitamins. I want you to focus on managing your symptoms and avoid any strenuous activity that exacerbates them. Do you have any other questions or concerns at this time?
PATIENT: Well, that’s…slightly reassuring, I suppose. But really, Doctor, this is all very disruptive. My clients rely on me. I have a reputation to uphold. And what if I do start experiencing those… dreadful symptoms? What then? Do I go to the emergency room? Or do I wait for an appointment? I simply cannot afford to be hospitalized. And one final question, Doctor. You said these tests are relatively straightforward. But are there any… risks associated with them? I don’t want to end up with some unforeseen complication. I’ve heard dreadful stories about medical procedures.
DOCTOR: I completely understand your concerns about disruption to your schedule and potential risks. Let's address those one by one. If you begin experiencing those severe symptoms – significant weakness, numbness, difficulty breathing, or changes in bowel or bladder function – please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Don’t wait for an appointment. Those symptoms require prompt medical attention. Regarding the risks associated with the tests, they are very minimal. The blood work involves a small amount of blood being drawn, which can cause minor discomfort or bruising at the injection site. The nerve conduction study involves small electrodes being placed on the skin and brief electrical impulses being used to assess nerve function. The main risk is mild discomfort or temporary skin irritation. There is a very small risk of infection at the electrode site, but we take precautions to minimize that risk. I want to reassure you that these tests are generally safe and well-tolerated. However, it’s important to be aware of potential risks, however small. I’ll provide you with detailed instructions on how to prepare for the tests and what to expect during the procedure. If you experience any adverse reactions, such as severe pain, swelling, or infection, please contact me immediately. I want to work with you to manage your symptoms and ensure you receive the best possible care. I understand your concerns about disruption to your schedule, and I'll do everything I can to expedite the tests and provide you with a clear and concise treatment plan. Do you have any other questions or concerns that I can address at this time?
PATIENT: Well, I suppose that’s all for now, Doctor. You’ve… addressed my concerns, I think. Though I’m still not entirely convinced this is necessary. But I suppose it’s better to be safe than sorry, as they say. I’ll schedule the blood work as soon as possible and try to get the nerve conduction study expedited. And I’ll… watch for those dreadful symptoms, as you instructed. Thank you for your time, Doctor Shely. I appreciate your… patience with my anxieties. I do hope this doesn’t take too long. My clients are expecting me, you see.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Firestone. I understand your anxieties, and I’m glad I could address them. I’ll do everything I can to expedite the tests and provide you with a clear diagnosis and treatment plan as quickly as possible. Here’s a handout with some helpful information. Please don’t hesitate to contact me if you have any questions or concerns. And remember, I’m here to support you throughout this process. I wish you all the best, Ms. Firestone. I hope you feel better soon. .
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate that. I really do. .
