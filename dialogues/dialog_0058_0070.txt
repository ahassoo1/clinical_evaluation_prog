DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Szmyd, have a seat. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Hmph. Seat is… small. But okay. I… new here. Just moved. Doctor… told me to come. Social… thing? I forget the name. Old doctor, back home, said I need check-up. Not feeling bad, you know? Just… what you do. New area. Everything small.
DOCTOR: Right. A check-up. A general physical. Okay. And you said you just moved here… from where, exactly?
PATIENT: From… Russia. Long time ago, now. Maybe… twenty years? No, more. I don’t… keep track. Cold place. Much snow. This place… warm. Everything… different. Lot of… colors. Not grey like home. Is that important? You need address? I forget number. Building… blue. Near… store. Small store.
DOCTOR: Okay, Russia. That’s… helpful. We'll get the address sorted out later, don't worry about that right now. So, you're not experiencing any specific symptoms, you just want a general check-up as recommended by your previous doctor?
PATIENT: Symptoms? No. Not really. Maybe… tired sometimes. Old age, you know? Everything hurts a little. But who doesn’t? I used to… work with faces. Make pretty. Theater. Very fancy. Now… just watch TV. Is that a symptom? Being… bored?
DOCTOR: "Tired" and "aches" are very broad, Mr. Szmyd. Everybody gets tired. And aches come with age, as you said. But we still need to rule things out. Let’s start with your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Conditions? Hmph. Doctors back home… always said I was strong. Stubborn, maybe. No… I don’t think so. Maybe… high blood? One time, doctor said. But… he gave me pills. I stopped taking them. Made me feel… funny. Not good. Not remembering much, you know? Old age again. They poke and prod, always ask questions. Is this one of those things?
DOCTOR: So, you were diagnosed with high blood pressure at some point, were prescribed medication, but stopped taking it because of side effects. Do you remember what side effects you experienced?
PATIENT: Side effects… no. Just… bad. Made my head… swimmy. And… stomach. Upset. Very unpleasant. I don’t like pills. They are… poison. My grandmother always said that. Best to just… tough it out. Strong Russian blood, you know? No need for fancy medicine. Is this important? You think I’m… sick? I feel fine, mostly. A little tired, a little achey. Normal.
DOCTOR: Okay. It's important that you tell me about medications you've stopped taking, even if you didn't like them. We need to know these things. And I'm not saying you're "sick," Mr. Szmyd. A check-up is just to get a baseline and make sure everything is functioning as it should. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmph. No. I eat everything. Russian food is… strong. Lot of pickles. Maybe… bees? Once, bee sting. Swelled up. But that was… long time ago. Very small bee. I don’t remember much. Is this… like interrogation? Asking too many questions. I just want… doctor to say I’m okay. Old man, watching TV. Not a problem.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, a bee sting in the past, with some swelling. Okay. Let's move on. Family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family… Hmph. Mother… died old. Father… same. Lots of… potatoes. Not much… sickness. Maybe… heart? Uncle, maybe? But he… drank a lot. Not healthy. Is that a condition? Drinking? Everyone drank. Russians… strong people. We don’t… fall apart easily. Not like… some people. I don't remember much, you know? Old family… far away. Lost touch. Is this important? You think drinking is a… sickness?
DOCTOR: Okay. We'll note the potential family history of heart issues and… a history of alcohol use. Mr. Szmyd, I'm asking these questions to get a complete picture of your health, not to judge your lifestyle. Now, do you currently take any medications, even over-the-counter ones?
PATIENT: Medications? No. Nothing. I told you. No pills. My grandmother always said… poison. I take… vitamins. Sometimes. When I remember. Small orange pills. Help with… energy. Not sure what kind. My neighbor… gave them to me. She said they are good. Is neighbor a doctor? She knows about… things. Not like fancy doctors. Just… common sense. You think vitamins… are bad? You think everything is bad? Hmph.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, you take vitamins occasionally, given to you by a neighbor. We'll document that. Now, let’s do a quick physical exam. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look in your ears and throat. Can you please sit up straight on the examination table?
PATIENT: Examination table? Hmph. Small. And cold. But okay. Straight… I think. My back… aches. Old age, you know? And… poking and prodding. I don’t like that. Will it hurt? Grandmother always said… doctors like to poke. Is this… necessary? Can’t you just… say I’m okay? I feel… fine. Mostly. A little tired, a little achey. And the table is cold. Very cold.
DOCTOR: It's necessary to get a baseline, Mr. Szmyd. It won't hurt, I'll be gentle. Just relax. Let me listen to your heart first. Heart rate is… regular, but slightly elevated. There is a faint murmur, which could be benign, but we'll need to investigate further. Blood pressure is 145/90. Elevated. Let's check your lungs now. Breath sounds are clear, but slightly diminished.
PATIENT: Diminished? What does that mean? Sounds bad. Like… old engine. My uncle… he had an engine. Always fixing it. Very loud. Is my engine… broken? And elevated? That also sounds bad. Like… angry. I don’t like angry. I just want… quiet. And warm. This table is very cold. Are you… sure you are a doctor? You sound… worried. My grandmother… always knew best. She said doctors just make things worse. Is this… going to cost a lot of money?
DOCTOR: “Diminished” means your breath sounds are a little quieter than expected, Mr. Szmyd. It doesn’t necessarily mean anything is wrong, but it warrants further investigation. And “elevated” blood pressure is higher than the recommended level. It doesn't mean you're "angry", it just means we need to address it to prevent future complications. Your abdomen is soft, but slightly tender in the upper right quadrant. Any pain when I press here?
PATIENT: Tender? Hmph. Everything is tender. Old age, you know? Like… bruised apple. Soft… like me. But… yes. Little bit. There. When you… push. Like… uncomfortable feeling. Not sharp. Just… there. Like… something is… heavy. Maybe… dinner? I ate a lot of potatoes. And pickles. My grandmother… made very good pickles. Maybe… it's the pickles? Are pickles… bad for you? Is everything… bad for you? Hmph. This is… stressful. And the table is still cold. Very, very cold.
DOCTOR: Okay. Tenderness in the upper right quadrant, potentially related to dietary intake. We’ll need to run some tests to get a clearer picture. I’m going to order a complete blood count, a basic metabolic panel, and a liver function test. We'll also do a urine analysis. These tests will help us evaluate your overall health, assess your kidney function, and check your liver enzymes. I also want to discuss your blood pressure. It's important to get it under control to prevent heart disease, stroke, and other serious complications. We can start with lifestyle modifications, such as diet and exercise, but you may also need medication. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Tests? More poking and prodding? I don't like tests. I just want… quiet. And warm. And maybe… a potato. Medication? No. No pills. My grandmother… she said they are poison. Lifestyle… what is that? Like… watching TV? Is that a lifestyle? I don't understand. You are talking… very fast. And… complicated. I just want to be… okay. Old man. Watching TV. Is that too much to ask? And… what about the cold table? Can I at least have a blanket? You think I am… very sick? Hmph. This is… very stressful. I need… pickles. And a warm blanket. And no pills. Absolutely no pills.
DOCTOR: Mr. Szmyd, I understand your concerns. The tests are necessary to get a better understanding of your health, and I'm not saying you're "very sick". I'm simply trying to rule out any potential problems. The tests involve a simple blood draw and a urine sample. It's not as invasive as you might think. Regarding lifestyle modifications, it means making healthy changes to your diet and exercise routine. Watching TV is fine in moderation, but it's not enough to maintain good health. I'll get you a blanket right away. And I respect your wishes regarding medication. We can explore non-pharmacological options for managing your blood pressure, but it's important to understand that medication may be necessary in the long run. Nurse, can you please bring a warm blanket for Mr. Szmyd?
PATIENT: Nurse? Okay. Blanket… good. Maybe… a pillow? My back… aches. And… pickles? Do you have pickles? Just kidding. Sort of. Non-pharmacological… what does that mean? Like… talking nicely to my blood pressure? Is that a thing? You are confusing me. Very confusing. I just want… to be left alone. And warm. And not poked and prodded. Is that too much to ask? And… will this cost a lot of money? My grandmother… always said doctors are very expensive. Hmph.
DOCTOR: “Non-pharmacological” means we’ll try to manage your blood pressure without medication, through things like diet, exercise, and stress reduction techniques. No, you don’t need to talk nicely to your blood pressure, although reducing stress can help. I understand your concerns about the cost. We'll review the charges with you before any procedures are performed. Medicare should cover a significant portion of the tests, but there may be some out-of-pocket expenses. We can discuss payment options if needed. For now, let's focus on getting you comfortable. The nurse will bring a blanket and a pillow. I’m going to order the lab tests, and we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Acceptable… I suppose. Blanket… good. Pillow… even better. Results… I don’t like results. Usually… bad. But okay. Follow-up… more poking and prodding? More questions? I just want… to be left alone. And warm. And maybe… a potato. But okay. Results… follow-up… whatever. Just… no pills. Absolutely no pills. And… will there be a cold table? At the follow-up? That is very important. A warm table… much better. And… can I at least have a glass of water? I’m… thirsty. All this talking… very stressful. Hmph.
DOCTOR: No pills, I understand. And I'll make a note to ensure there's a warm examination table at your follow-up appointment. I'll also ask the nurse to bring you a glass of water right away. We'll start with the blood tests and urine sample. Then we can discuss a plan for managing your blood pressure based on the results. For now, just relax and try to get comfortable. The nurse will be with you shortly. Is there anything else I can do for you at this moment?
PATIENT: Nothing… I think. Just… warm blanket. And pillow. And no pills. Absolutely no pills. And… a glass of water. And… can you promise me the table will be warm? Very, very warm? That is very important. I just want… to be left alone. And warm. And… not poked and prodded. Is that too much to ask? Hmph. I think… that is all. For now. Thank you… I suppose. It was… stressful. Very stressful. Can I at least have a potato after this? Just kidding. Sort of. .
DOCTOR: I promise I’ll do my best to ensure the examination table is warm at your follow-up appointment. And no pills, I understand. I'll focus on non-pharmacological options for now. Here's your water. The nurse will also help you with the lab tests. Just relax and try to take deep breaths. I'll see you at your follow-up appointment. Please don't hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or concerns before then. .
