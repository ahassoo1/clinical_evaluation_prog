DOCTOR: Good morning, Velda. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Bombara. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. It’s very kind of you to see me. I’m here about a cruise, actually. I’m hoping you can help me get some paperwork sorted. It’s for the ship’s doctor, you see – they need some information about my health before I go. I’ve got a form here they gave me.
DOCTOR: A pre-cruise health form, yes, I understand. Those are quite common. Alright, well, let’s get that sorted then. It’s good you’re being proactive. Perhaps you could tell me a little bit about your overall health?
PATIENT: Certainly. Well, I’m… generally quite fit for my age, I think. I don’t get out as much since my husband passed, but I used to be very active. I walk when the weather’s nice, and I try to eat a sensible diet. No major illnesses, thankfully. I had the flu a few years back, but nothing… serious. Is there anything specific you need to know from the form, or should I just…start at the beginning?
DOCTOR: Starting at the beginning is fine. We’ll cover everything on the form, but it’s always good to get your perspective first. Let's start with the history of present illness, or HPI. Are you currently experiencing any health problems, anything that's bothering you right now?
PATIENT: Oh, right. “History of…”. Yes, well, nothing major, no. My knees are a bit creaky, especially when it’s cold, but that’s just age, I suppose. And sometimes I get a bit of heartburn after a meal, if I’ve eaten something rich. But I manage it with a little indigestion tablet. Is that what you mean by “health problems”? Nothing a bit of paracetamol won’t help, truly.
DOCTOR: Okay, creaky knees and occasional heartburn. That gives us a starting point. Let’s clarify a few things. When you say “creaky knees,” is it a constant ache, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It definitely comes and goes, Doctor. It’s worse in the mornings, and if I’ve been sitting for too long. Then it eases up after a bit of walking. And, like I said, cold weather is a terrible thing for them! It’s not… disabling, not at all. Just a bit… uncomfortable. It doesn't swell or anything, though. Just stiff.
DOCTOR: Alright, so more of a stiffness than a pain, worse in the mornings and with cold weather, and improves with movement. And no swelling. Good to know. Now, about the heartburn… how often would you say you experience that?
PATIENT: Oh, not very often at all. Maybe once or twice a month, if I'm being honest. It’s usually after a particularly nice dinner, perhaps something with a bit of cream sauce or a spicy curry. Nothing too dramatic, Doctor. It’s not a constant thing, and it doesn't keep me awake at night. A quick tablet and a glass of water usually does the trick. I wouldn't say it interferes with my life.
DOCTOR: Okay, so intermittent heartburn, triggered by rich foods, easily managed with over-the-counter medication. Let's move on to a quick review of systems. Have you noticed any changes in your weight recently, either gain or loss?
PATIENT: No, not really. I’ve been pretty steady, I think. I weigh myself now and then, but it's always about the same. Perhaps a pound or two either way, but nothing significant. I haven't been dieting or anything. I just…eat normal portions, you know? And I try to stay active when I can, walking and little bits of gardening. It’s not a rigorous schedule, but I keep moving.
DOCTOR: Alright, stable weight. That’s good. Any issues with your sleep?
PATIENT: No, I sleep quite well, thankfully. I usually go to bed around ten and wake up around seven, and I sleep right through. No trouble getting off to sleep, and no waking up in the middle of the night. I’m a sound sleeper, I’ve always been. Though I do get up once or twice for a quick trip to the bathroom, but that's just age, I imagine! I don't feel tired during the day.
DOCTOR: Good, good. That’s positive. Now, have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits recently?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Is that…is that a polite way of asking about…well, that? No, not really. Everything is quite regular, if you see what I mean. No changes, no problems. I try to eat plenty of fruit and fibre, you know. Keeps everything ticking over nicely! I'm not wanting to go into too much detail, Doctor, if you don’t mind! It's all very…private.
DOCTOR: Absolutely not, you’re quite right to ask! It's a routine question, and you've answered perfectly. No changes in bowel habits. That’s all we need to know. Now, let's talk about your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any significant medical conditions – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that, Doctor. I’ve always been quite healthy, thankfully. The doctor always said I had a strong constitution. I’ve had the usual childhood illnesses – measles, mumps, chickenpox – but nothing serious. I had my tonsils out when I was a little girl, and I’ve needed glasses since I was forty, but that’s all. No major illnesses, no operations beyond the tonsils. And I keep up to date with my vaccinations, you know, the yearly flu jab.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s very good to know. Tonsils removed as a child, glasses, and up-to-date vaccinations. No other significant medical history. And what about past surgical history - aside from your tonsils, have you ever had any other operations?
PATIENT: No, not at all. Just the tonsils, when I was very young. And honestly, I don't even remember it being very painful. My mother said it was a quick recovery. I've never had anything else removed, or any serious injuries that required an operation. Just the usual bumps and bruises, you know, from gardening and falling about a bit. Nothing requiring a hospital stay or anything. I am a very careful person!
DOCTOR: That's excellent. Now, moving onto family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, cancer, diabetes, or stroke?
PATIENT: Hmm, that’s a good question. My mother lived to be eighty-five, but she had arthritis in her hips, so she was a bit…crippled towards the end. And my father had high blood pressure, I think, but he smoked a lot, so that was probably the cause. My brother is perfectly healthy, as far as I know, and he’s still going strong at seventy. No one else in the family has had anything too serious, not that I’m aware of. Just the usual ailments, you know, colds, flu, aches and pains. Nothing major. I do hope that answers your question, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's very helpful. Arthritis in your mother, high blood pressure in your father. Now, let’s talk about your social history. Do you smoke, or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Oh, no, never smoked in my life. My husband smoked for a bit when he was younger, but he gave it up years ago. And I don't drink alcohol, not at all. I never liked the taste of it, and it just doesn't appeal to me. I prefer a nice cup of tea, you know! I have a little gin every Christmas with my brother, but that is the extent of it! I keep a fairly quiet life these days, mostly reading and gardening.
DOCTOR: Alright, no smoking, minimal alcohol consumption. And finally, do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not at all. I haven't got any allergies, not that I am aware of. I can take any medication without any problems, and I've never had a reaction to anything. I've never been stung by a bee, and I'm not allergic to any foods. I can eat anything and drink anything without any trouble. Honestly, Doctor, I'm a very straightforward patient! No fuss, no bother. It's lovely to finally see a doctor who isn't asking too much! It makes a change!
DOCTOR: Well, that is excellent news, Velda! It sounds like you're in remarkably good health for your age, and that's a testament to a healthy lifestyle. Now, I'd just like to quickly perform a physical examination, if that’s alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. I don’t mind at all. I've always liked a good check-up, just to make sure everything is ticking over nicely. I haven't had one in a while, so it'll be good to get everything checked. Where do you want me to start? And will it be...uncomfortable? I do have a rather low pain threshold, you see.
DOCTOR: Not at all uncomfortable, Velda. Just routine. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure and pulse, and take a quick look in your ears, nose and throat. I’ll also feel your abdomen. Just let me know if anything feels particularly sensitive. First, let's start with your blood pressure. Please sit here, and I'll take it on both arms. 142 over 88 on the right arm, and 140 over 86 on the left. Slightly elevated, but not alarming. It can fluctuate. I’m noting that for monitoring. Now, pulse is a steady 78, regular rhythm. Heart sounds are normal, no murmurs or irregularities detected. Lungs are clear to auscultation, no wheezes or crackles.
PATIENT: Oh, very good. I'm glad everything sounds normal. I do worry a bit about my heart, you see, my mother had palpitations sometimes. But I’m glad you said there’s nothing to worry about. What about my ears? Are they alright? I sometimes get a bit of wax build-up, I think. I don't like sticking anything in my ears, though, so I just leave it. It doesn’t bother my hearing.
DOCTOR: Alright, Velda, your ears are clear. A little bit of cerumen present, as is common, but nothing significant. Your ear canals are clear, and your eardrums appear normal. Your throat looks clear as well, no signs of infection or inflammation. Now, your abdomen is soft, non-tender. No masses or organomegaly detected. Everything seems to be in good working order. A little elevated blood pressure, but it’s likely a situational spike. We can monitor that over time.
PATIENT: Oh, that’s lovely to hear, Doctor. I do feel much better knowing everything is alright. It’s good to have a proper check-up, just to put my mind at ease. So, what does this all mean for my cruise, then? Will my blood pressure cause any problems? I don’t want to be a bother to the ship’s doctor.
DOCTOR: No, I don’t think it will cause any problems, Velda. Your blood pressure is only slightly elevated, and it’s likely due to the stress of travel or simply being in a doctor’s office. As long as you’re feeling well and don't have any symptoms like headaches, dizziness, or vision changes, you should be perfectly fine. I would recommend keeping an eye on your blood pressure at home if you have a monitor, just for peace of mind. And, it would be wise to inform the ship’s doctor of your slightly elevated readings, just so they are aware. They may want to check it during your cruise, which is a sensible precaution. Based on my examination and your medical history, I don’t see any reason why you shouldn’t enjoy your cruise. Do you have any other questions or concerns I can address?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s wonderful news, Doctor! I am so relieved. I was very worried about causing trouble for the ship’s doctor. And yes, I do have a blood pressure monitor at home, so I will keep a close eye on it. I will definitely mention my readings to the ship’s doctor, just to be on the safe side. No, I don’t think I have any other questions at the moment. You have been so thorough and kind, Doctor, I really appreciate it. You've put my mind completely at ease! Perhaps just one last thing... would you mind signing this form, please? It’s the one the cruise line gave me.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Velda. Here you go. It states you are fit to travel, with a note regarding your slightly elevated blood pressure – just as a precaution. I hope you have a wonderful time on your cruise! Enjoy the sunshine and make some lovely memories. If you have any concerns once you’re travelling, don’t hesitate to contact me, although I may not be able to respond immediately. The ship’s doctor will be your best resource. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: Oh, thank you so much, Doctor! You've been a lifesaver, honestly. No, I think that’s everything. I really appreciate you taking the time to listen and answer all my questions. You've been so patient and understanding. I think I'll just be on my way now. I need to get back and pack, you see, the cruise is next week! Thank you again for everything!
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Velda. It was my pleasure. Enjoy your cruise, and please, take good care of yourself. Don’t hesitate to reach out if anything changes. Safe travels, and have a wonderful time!
PATIENT: Thank you again, Doctor. You've been wonderful! I will! Goodbye!
