DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Knabenshue. I’m Dr. Duplichan. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor Duplichan. It’s a pleasure to meet you. I am here regarding a matter at my place of work. It concerns the requirement to wear masks, and… well, I’m hoping to discuss a possible exemption. I understand it’s a sensitive topic, and I want to be respectful of everyone’s health, but it’s causing me some difficulties.
DOCTOR: Difficulties, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. It's… a long story, truthfully. But to put it simply, I experience some… discomfort when wearing a mask for extended periods. It’s not a matter of preference, you understand. It feels… restrictive, and it affects my breathing, a little. I work with people, and I need to be able to think clearly and respond quickly, and it’s hard when I feel… closed in. I’ve tried different kinds, but it doesn’t seem to help much.
DOCTOR: Restrictive and affecting your breathing… And you’ve experimented with various mask types?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, I have. Surgical masks, the cloth ones, even those N95 filters. I tried the ones with the valve, thinking that might help, but my supervisor said those weren't allowed. I've really tried to make it work, honestly. I understand the need for safety, and I wouldn't want to put anyone at risk. It’s just… after a few hours, I start to feel quite anxious, and a little… lightheaded, if I'm being honest. It impacts my ability to focus on the job, which is assisting families in need.
DOCTOR: I see you have a history of… well, not a great deal documented, Mr. Knabenshue. No pre-existing respiratory conditions listed. And no recent sick visits that would explain breathing difficulties. When did this discomfort begin?
PATIENT: That is… accurate, Doctor. I don't often find the need to visit a doctor. I try to stay healthy, and I’ve been fortunate, generally. This discomfort… it started when the mask requirements were put in place at work, about six months ago, I’d say. At first, I thought it was just something I needed to get used to. But it hasn’t improved, and if anything, it’s gotten a little worse. It's not a constant thing, not like an asthma attack or anything. It’s more… gradual. A building feeling of unease, and then the lightheadedness. I am, as you can likely tell, a fairly large man, and perhaps it requires more air than some.
DOCTOR: And has anything similar ever happened before – feelings of restriction or lightheadedness – unrelated to mask wearing?
PATIENT: That’s a good question, Doctor. Now that you mention it… yes, actually. As a young man, I spent a good deal of time participating in traditional Lakota ceremonies. Some of those involve enclosed spaces and periods of focused breathing, and… sometimes, I would experience a similar feeling of lightheadedness. It wasn’t frequent, and it never lasted long. But it was… comparable. It's difficult to explain, but it felt like a restriction of air, a feeling of being… confined. It’s been many years, though. I hadn't thought about it until you asked.
DOCTOR: So, potentially related to periods of concentrated breathing and enclosed spaces. Do you know if anyone in your family has a history of anxiety or panic disorders?
PATIENT: That’s… a difficult question, Doctor. My family history isn't something that was… openly discussed. We didn’t spend a lot of time talking about such things. My grandmother, on my mother’s side, was a very private woman. She was the keeper of our traditions, but she didn’t share much about personal ailments. I recall her being… easily overwhelmed by large crowds, and she preferred to be alone. But whether that was anxiety or simply her personality, I couldn’t say. My father’s side… I didn't know him well. He passed away when I was young. I have no information about his medical history. I apologize I can't be of more assistance there. It is not a topic that was… commonplace in my upbringing.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’d like to perform a brief physical examination, Mr. Knabenshue. I’ll listen to your lungs, check your heart rate and blood pressure, and assess your overall respiratory function. This will help me determine if there’s an underlying physical cause for your discomfort. Is that agreeable to you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that is perfectly agreeable. I understand the need for a thorough examination. I'm happy to cooperate in any way that will help determine the cause of this issue. I am not one to complain unnecessarily, but I do want to find a solution that allows me to continue my work without putting myself or others at risk. Please proceed. I trust your judgment.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you’ll please have a seat and loosen your shirt. I’ll start with your heart rate and blood pressure. Take a deep breath for me, Mr. Knabenshue… and exhale slowly. Good. Heart sounds are regular. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally, but your respiratory rate is slightly elevated. Blood pressure is 145/90, which is a bit high. Now, could you take a few deep breaths for me – as if you were experiencing this discomfort – and let me know if you feel any tightness in your chest or shortness of breath?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. As I take these deeper breaths, I do feel a… tightness in my chest, yes. It’s not severe, but it is noticeable. It’s a constriction, almost. And my breathing does become a little more… labored. I also feel a slight… dizziness, if I'm being honest. It's not enough to make me unsteady, but I can feel a bit… lightheaded. It is similar to what I feel when wearing the mask for extended periods, though perhaps not as intense. It is… unsettling. It doesn't feel painful, exactly, just… restrictive.
DOCTOR: Alright. Chest wall is pliable, no tenderness to palpation. Back is clear as well. Given your history and these findings, it appears you may be experiencing anxiety-induced hyperventilation, potentially triggered by the sensation of restriction from the mask. The elevated blood pressure could be a contributing factor, or a result of the anxiety itself. However, to rule out any underlying cardiac or pulmonary issues, I’d like to order a few tests. I recommend an EKG, a chest X-ray, and a complete blood count. Would that be acceptable to you?
PATIENT: That sounds… reasonable, Doctor. If those tests will help determine the cause of this issue, then yes, I am agreeable to them. I trust your professional judgment. I understand the need for a thorough investigation. An EKG, a chest X-ray, and a complete blood count… yes, those are acceptable. I just hope they don't take too long, as I have families relying on me. But I understand the importance of getting a proper diagnosis. Perhaps we could schedule them for as soon as possible?
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I’ll put in the orders immediately. Our lab technician should be able to accommodate you quickly. We’ll aim to get these tests completed today. In the meantime, I’m going to prescribe a low-dose anti-anxiety medication to help manage your symptoms. It's a temporary measure, just to provide some relief while we await the test results. I will also provide a note for your employer explaining your situation and recommending a temporary accommodation, perhaps allowing you to wear a face shield instead of a mask, if that's feasible. Would you have any objections to that?
PATIENT: That sounds… very thoughtful, Doctor. A low-dose anti-anxiety medication to help with the symptoms, and a note for my employer… that would be immensely helpful. I appreciate your understanding. A face shield would be… preferable, yes. It would still provide some protection without the feeling of constriction. I have no objections to that at all. I truly appreciate you taking the time to listen and offer solutions. It eases my mind considerably. Thank you. Perhaps if the medication helps, and the tests come back clear, it was simply the anxiety all along. That would be a relief.
DOCTOR: That's my hope as well, Mr. Knabenshue. It’s often the simplest explanation. I’ll write the prescription and the note now. We’ll review the test results as soon as they’re available, and discuss a long-term plan. Do you have any allergies to medications I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I do not. I’ve never had any adverse reactions to medications, thankfully. I’ve always been… quite fortunate in that regard. No allergies to be concerned about. You can proceed without worry. I am grateful for your thoroughness, checking everything so carefully. It truly does ease my mind.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Here are the prescription for the anti-anxiety medication and the note for your employer. Please take the prescription to the pharmacy as soon as possible. The lab technician will be with you shortly to draw blood for the tests. We'll schedule a follow-up appointment for next week to discuss the results. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I believe you've covered everything quite thoroughly. I am very grateful for your time, your patience, and your understanding. I feel much more at ease knowing we are taking steps to address this issue. No, I don't have any questions at the moment. Thank you again. I will take the prescription to the pharmacy immediately, and I look forward to our follow-up appointment next week. May I ask your name again for my records?
DOCTOR: Certainly. My name is Dr. Mirjana Duplichan. It was a pleasure meeting you, Mr. Knabenshue. I hope you feel better soon. If anything changes or you experience any worsening symptoms, please don't hesitate to contact the clinic. .
PATIENT: It was a pleasure meeting you as well, Dr. Duplichan. Thank you again for your kindness and professionalism. I will keep your contact information handy, and I will reach out if anything changes. Have a good day, Doctor.
