DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Yadao. I’m Dr. Murtic. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it's... going to the bathroom. Or, more accurately, not going to the bathroom easily. It's been a bit of a struggle lately.
DOCTOR: “A struggle,” you say. Alright. Can you be a bit more specific?
PATIENT: Well, it just takes a long time to start, you know? And even then, it's not a strong stream. It feels like... like I have to push, but nothing much comes out. It's a bit embarrassing to talk about, really. I don't usually have trouble like this.
DOCTOR: I understand it's not a comfortable topic, Ms. Yadao, but it's important we discuss it. "Taking a long time" – how long are we talking?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think... normally it’s pretty quick, just a few seconds. But now? Sometimes I’m standing there for a good minute, maybe even two, before anything happens. And I have to really strain. It's not like a sudden rush, like it used to be. More... dribbling, if I’m honest.
DOCTOR: Alright. And has anything changed recently?
PATIENT: Hmm... not that I can think of. I haven't changed my diet much. I drink about the same amount of water, maybe a little less in the summer because it’s so hot. I haven’t been sick, no fever or anything. Oh! Wait a minute… I did start taking a new vitamin a couple of months ago. It’s for my joints, they get a bit creaky, you know? It’s called… let me see… rummages in purse … Ah, here it is. “Flexi-Joint Plus.” Does that sound like anything?
DOCTOR: Flexi-Joint Plus… I’ll make a note of that. It’s possible that could be contributing. Now, besides the difficulty starting and the weak stream, are you experiencing any pain or burning when you urinate?
PATIENT: No, no pain at all. Not a bit. It’s just… difficult. And frustrating, really. It doesn't hurt, just… doesn’t want to go. Sometimes I feel like I haven’t emptied my bladder completely, even after I've tried for a while. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes sense. And how often are you urinating during the day, generally?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… usually, it’s about every three or four hours. Maybe five if I’m busy. At night? I usually get up once, maybe twice, to go. It hasn’t really changed much, to be honest. It's just how I go that’s different. The effort, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any changes in the color of your urine?
PATIENT: Hmm… now that you mention it… maybe a little darker than usual? It's hard to say, I don't pay that much attention, to be honest. But I think so. Not bright red or anything, just… not as clear as it normally is. More… a sort of amber color, I guess. It’s been happening for a week or so, maybe longer.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Yadao. I'm going to need to do a quick physical exam and order a urine sample. It's just to rule out any obvious issues. We'll check for a UTI and look at your prostate—just routine, despite you being female. It's important to be thorough. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, a prostate? But… I'm a woman! I thought only men had those. But… if you think it’s necessary, Doctor, then yes, alright. Do whatever you need to do. I just want to get this sorted out, you know? It's getting a bit worrisome.
DOCTOR: Yes, well, sometimes we need to check those things, even in women, to be absolutely certain. It's a simple exam. Let's start with a urine sample. I’ll have you step into the restroom and collect one. Then, we'll do a quick abdominal exam and a pelvic exam, just to be comprehensive. Do you have any questions before we begin?
PATIENT: Oh… a pelvic exam. Right. I… suppose not. No, I don't think so. Just… try to be quick, if you could, Doctor? I'm not particularly fond of those. And is there anything I should do before the urine sample? Like, drink extra water or something?
DOCTOR: Just a normal sample will do, Ms. Yadao. No need to drink extra water. The important thing is to try and collect a mid-stream sample. I’ll give you instructions in the restroom. Now, if you'll excuse me, I'll prepare the exam room.
PATIENT: Alright. Sounds good. I'll… go and do that, then. adjusts purse strap nervously Thank you, Doctor.
