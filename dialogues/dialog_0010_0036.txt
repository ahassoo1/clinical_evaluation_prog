DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Barban. I’m Dr. Annesley. Welcome to the clinic. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Yes, good morning. I am here for… a check-up. Before the insurance starts, you understand? They said I need this… this paper from you. A physical. Is that correct? I do not like wasting time, so I hope this is quick.
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely. A physical to satisfy the insurance requirements. I understand wanting to be efficient with your time, Mr. Barban. We’ll get through this as smoothly as possible. Just to be clear, are you experiencing any specific health concerns right now, or is this strictly for the insurance paperwork?
PATIENT: No concerns. Nothing. I feel… fine. As fine as a man can feel, I suppose. I work, I eat, I sleep. It is all very normal. I do not come to doctors unless something is broken, you see? This is just… a formality. A necessary evil, perhaps.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. Preventative care is important, even when you're feeling well. Alright, let's start with a quick review of your medical history. I see here you're 28 years old. Do you have any significant past medical problems – anything you've been treated for before?
PATIENT: No. Nothing. I have never been… seriously ill. A few colds, of course. A cut here and there from work. But nothing a little cleaning and a bandage could not fix. My family… we are healthy people. We do not spend much time with doctors. It is… not our way.
DOCTOR: Good to hear. And have you ever had any surgeries, Mr. Barban?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never. I have all my original parts, thank you very much. I am a practical man. I avoid things that require… cutting. It seems unwise.
DOCTOR: Certainly understandable. Now, thinking about your family – are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm. My… grandfather, on my mother’s side, he had… something with his heart, I think. Old age, mostly. He lived a long life. And my aunt… she had problems with her stomach, many years ago. But that is all I know. We do not… discuss these things openly. It is considered… bad luck, perhaps.
DOCTOR: I understand. We’ll work with what we have. Now, could you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle? What does that mean, exactly? I go to work. I work hard. I come home. I eat. I sleep. I do not… go to clubs, if that is what you are asking. I do not drink much. I do not smoke. A simple life. Is that not enough?
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Barban, that is enough. It's good to hear you maintain a healthy routine. Just a few more questions to get a complete picture. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies. Never. I eat everything. I can handle anything. My stomach is very strong. I have… tested it, you could say. Spicy food, rich food, everything. No problems. I do not believe in these… sensitivities people talk about. A little discomfort builds character.
DOCTOR: Alright, good to know. And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No. Nothing. I do not put things into my body unless absolutely necessary. Water, food… that is enough. I do not trust these… pills. Too many chemicals. I prefer to let my body heal itself. It has done a good job so far, you see?
DOCTOR: That's excellent. Now, to complete the physical exam, I'd like to check your vital signs – blood pressure, pulse, temperature – and listen to your heart and lungs. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, do what you must. Just… be quick about it, if you do not mind. I have things to do later. And please, no cold instruments. I do not like the feeling.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I'll be as efficient and gentle as possible. Let's start with your blood pressure. Just relax your arm for me… excellent. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Just breathe normally. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs noted. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Pulse is 72 and regular. Temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit. Everything seems within normal limits so far. Now, could you stand for me so I can check your reflexes?
PATIENT: Fine. Stand, you say? Just… get it over with. I do not enjoy being poked and prodded. I am a practical man, remember? I need to be getting back to work. This is… not how I spend my time.
DOCTOR: Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally, normal. Good. Now, if you could just turn your head and look to the left, and then to the right… excellent. Range of motion is full, cranial nerves are intact. Alright, Mr. Barban, everything appears to be within normal limits. I don't detect any immediate concerns. To complete the paperwork for your insurance, I'll document these findings and sign the necessary forms. It should only take a few minutes.
PATIENT: Good. Very good. That is all I wanted to hear. No problems. Excellent. Just… hurry with the paper, please. I have a job to do. A good job. And I do not like to be late.
DOCTOR: Here you are, Mr. Barban. This should satisfy the insurance requirements. It documents a normal physical exam, with no acute concerns identified. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No. No questions. Just… thank you. For not wasting my time, you understand? This is… sufficient. I have work to do. Good day, Doctor. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Barban. Have a productive day. And if any concerns arise in the future, please don't hesitate to schedule an appointment. .
