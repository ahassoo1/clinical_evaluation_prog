DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Gentz. I’m Dr. Annesley. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning. Look, Doc, it's not exactly nice to meet someone when you're feelin' like death warmed over, but alright. It's my stomach. Been bleedin'. Not a little bit, either. It's… unpleasant. Real unpleasant. I thought I'd best get it checked before I end up a mess.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Gentz, I understand. Bleeding is never pleasant, and you're right to get it checked out. I want to get a good understanding of what’s been going on. Could you tell me a little more about this bleeding?
PATIENT: Well, it started a few days ago. Just felt…off, you know? Weak. Then, when I went to the bathroom… it was in my stool. Dark, like… coffee grounds. And there was a good amount of it. Not just a streak, Doc, a good amount. It’s happened a couple times since. And I’ve been feelin’ dizzy, too. Like I might pass out. It’s got me worried, and frankly, I don’t usually bother with doctors unless somethin’ is really wrong.
DOCTOR: Okay, dark, coffee-ground-like stool and dizziness… that’s concerning, and you're right to be worried. That suggests it’s not something to ignore. To help me narrow things down, could you tell me if you’ve experienced any nausea or vomiting?
PATIENT: Nah, no vomit. Not a bit. Just… weak. And tired. Real tired. Like all the color’s been drained outta me. And the dizziness comes on quick. I was tryin’ to tidy up the yard yesterday, and nearly face-planted into the rose bushes. It's just... not right. And I haven’t been eatin’ much, either. Doesn’t seem worth the effort, if you catch my drift.
DOCTOR: I do catch your drift, Mr. Gentz. Loss of appetite alongside the weakness and dizziness is definitely something we need to investigate. Let’s go over some of your medical history, if you don't mind. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions – things like ulcers, gastritis, or any heart problems?
PATIENT: Heart problems? Heavens no. Always been as strong as an ox, even if I do say so myself. Ulcers… not that I know of. Doc, I ain’t one for fancy hospitals and poking and prodding. I avoid ‘em like the plague. My wife, God rest her soul, she handled all that paperwork and rememberin' things like diagnoses. I just… showed up when I needed somethin’ fixed. Mostly broken bones from farm work, you know? This… this bleedin’ is somethin’ new.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful to know. So, mostly farm-related injuries in the past, and no prior diagnoses that you're aware of. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Nope. Never. I told ya, I avoid hospitals. One time, broke my collarbone real bad when a fence post gave way. The doc tried to talk me into surgery, said it would heal better. I just told him to wrap it up good and I'd get on with it. He grumbled, but he did it. Healed just fine, though it clicked a bit for a while. Never needed a knife, though. Never wanted one.
DOCTOR: Alright, no surgeries. Good to know. Now, thinking about your family – are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Well, my mother, she had… what was it now? Some kind of trouble with her stomach, always complainin’ about heartburn. Doc gave her pills for it, but she never really liked takin’ ‘em. She lived to be eighty-five, so it didn't bother her too much, I guess. My father, he was a strong man, like me. Never sick a day in his life, ‘til the very end. Just… wore out, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, some heartburn in your mother’s history, but otherwise, a fairly healthy family. Do you currently take any medications – even over-the-counter ones like aspirin, ibuprofen, or antacids?
PATIENT: Antacids, yeah. I've been poppin’ those like candy the last few days. Tums, mostly. Tryin' to settle my stomach. Doesn't seem to be doin' much good, though. Other than that… no. I don’t like takin’ pills, you know? They never seem to fix anything. Just mask the problem.
DOCTOR: Alright, just Tums, and not much relief. Finally, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope. Not that I know of. I eat pretty much anything that doesn’t bite back. And I've never had a reaction to anythin’ a doc ever gave me, though, like I said, I don't go to 'em much. Dust bothers me a bit, workin’ around the yard and all, but that ain’t an allergy, is it? Just… common sense to wear a mask sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Alright, Mr. Gentz, thank you for that information. Now, I’m going to need to do a quick physical exam. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and then I'll need to gently press on your abdomen to get a better feel for what's going on. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Fine, fine. Get it over with. I got things to do, you know? But hurry it up, Doc. This ain’t exactly a pleasant situation, and I'd rather be gettin’ back to… well, nothin', really, but at least be comfortable while I’m doin’ it.
DOCTOR: Alright. Your heart rate is a little elevated, which is understandable given the bleeding and dizziness, and your lungs sound clear. Now, I’m going to press here and here… does that cause any pain?
PATIENT: Yeah, that… that’s tender. Right there, on the left side. Not a sharp pain, but… uncomfortable. Like a dull ache. And a little lower down, too. Feels… swollen, maybe? I don’t know. It just doesn’t feel right. Not like it normally does. I've never had much trouble with my stomach before, so I reckon somethin’ is definitely wrong.
DOCTOR: Okay, tenderness in the left upper and lower quadrants. I'm also palpating a mild distention. Your abdomen is also warm to the touch. Given your symptoms – the coffee-ground stool, dizziness, weakness, and now the tenderness I’m feeling – I'm concerned about a potential gastrointestinal bleed. It's important to figure out the source of the bleeding. I'm going to order some blood tests, including a complete blood count to check your hemoglobin levels and assess the extent of the blood loss. I'll also order a stool test to confirm the presence of blood and rule out other causes. Finally, I'd like to get a CT scan of your abdomen to get a better look at your stomach, intestines, and other organs. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: CT scan, huh? Sounds… serious. Look, Doc, I ain't one for fancy machines and procedures. Is it gonna be expensive? I ain’t got insurance, you know. And frankly, I just want this fixed. I don't need a lot of tests tellin' me I'm bleedin', I already know that. Can’t you just… give me somethin’ to stop it?
DOCTOR: You're right to be concerned about the cost, Mr. Gentz. I understand your situation, and I'll do my best to keep things as affordable as possible. We can discuss options for financial assistance at the hospital, and I’ll also see if there are any local programs that might be able to help. However, a CT scan is the best way to determine the source of the bleeding, which is crucial for deciding the right treatment. It will help us determine if it's an ulcer, a tear, or something else entirely. Without knowing the cause, I can’t safely give you medication to stop the bleeding, as it could potentially mask a more serious underlying problem. I understand your reluctance, but please trust me when I say that this is the safest course of action. We can talk about the cost upfront and explore all available options. In the meantime, I’m going to start an IV to give you fluids and help stabilize you. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Alright, alright. Do what you gotta do. I don’t like it, but… I guess I don’t have much choice. Just… try not to keep me here any longer than you have to. And please, tell me how much this is gonna cost before you start stickin’ needles in me. I ain’t made of money. And fluids are fine, I suppose. Better than nothin'.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Gentz, I understand. I'll explain everything upfront, and we'll discuss the costs before proceeding with anything. The nurse will start the IV now. That will take just a few minutes. Once that's in, we'll get the orders for the blood tests and CT scan sent to the lab and radiology department. I'll also have someone from our financial services department come speak with you about payment options and potential assistance programs. In the meantime, I want to ask a few more questions about your diet. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite recently?
PATIENT: Changes in my appetite? Doc, I told ya, I ain’t been eatin’ much of anything. Just… no interest. Even my wife’s baklava, and I love her baklava. That should tell you somethin'. It just feels like… a waste of effort. Food just sits heavy in my stomach, makes me feel worse. I've been livin’ on tea and a few crackers, if that tells ya anything. And even those don't stay down long. It's not like I’m enjoyin' a feast, I can assure ya.
DOCTOR: Okay, loss of appetite and difficulty keeping food down. That’s consistent with a gastrointestinal issue. Do you experience any heartburn or indigestion, even with just a small amount of food?
PATIENT: Heartburn? Yeah, sometimes. Not all the time, but when I do try to eat somethin', it comes up on me pretty quick. A burnin' sensation in my chest, makes me want to lie down. And it doesn’t matter what I eat, really. Doesn’t matter if it's somethin’ light or somethin’ heavy. It just… happens. Used to take those Tums for it, like I said, but they ain't doin’ much good anymore.
DOCTOR: Okay, persistent heartburn despite using antacids. Now, this is important: have you ever noticed any blood in your vomit?
PATIENT: ...Yeah. A couple of times. Not a lot. Just… streaks. Bright red. Thought it was somethin' I ate, maybe. But now… now I reckon it wasn't. It was with the dizziness, too. Happened both times. I… I didn’t tell anyone. Didn’t want to cause a fuss. Thought it would go away on its own.
DOCTOR: Thank you for telling me, Mr. Gentz. That information is very important. Blood in your vomit, combined with the coffee-ground stool and dizziness, strongly suggests an upper gastrointestinal bleed, likely from the stomach or duodenum. The fact that the Tums aren’t helping and you’re experiencing heartburn and nausea is also concerning. We need to get this diagnosed and treated quickly. I'm going to admit you to the hospital for further evaluation and treatment. We'll start with the blood tests and CT scan, and then a gastroenterologist will likely perform an endoscopy to visualize your stomach and intestines directly. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Endoscopy, huh? Stickin' a camera down my throat… Wonderful. Just wonderful. Look, Doc, I ain’t thrilled about any of this, but… what choice do I have? I guess I’m stuck with it. Just… promise me you’ll do everything you can to fix this. I don’t want to end up… well, you know. Just fix it. And let me know what this is gonna cost before you start stickin’ things in me.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Gentz, and I promise you I'll do everything I can to get you diagnosed and treated quickly and effectively. An endoscopy is the best way to determine the source of the bleeding and allow us to treat it directly, if necessary. Please prepare Mr. Gentz for admission to the hospital. Start the IV fluids and draw the blood tests as quickly as possible. I’ll also page Dr. Ramirez, the gastroenterologist, to come evaluate Mr. Gentz. I'll speak with the financial services department and get a detailed estimate of the costs for the tests, endoscopy, and hospital stay. I’ll also explore all available financial assistance programs and discuss them with you. In the meantime, please try to relax. We’re going to take good care of you. Is there anyone you’d like us to contact?
PATIENT: No. No family. My wife… she passed away a few years back. Didn’t have any children. Just me. Don’t bother with anyone. Just… get on with it, Doc. Get it fixed. That's all I ask. Just get it fixed. And… thank you. For tryin', I mean. Even if I don't show it, I appreciate it.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Gentz. We’ll do everything we can. We'll take excellent care of you. Let's get you comfortable and start these tests. The nurse will explain everything as we go. I'll be back as soon as I've spoken with Dr. Ramirez and have more information. Please don’t hesitate to call if you need anything at all.
