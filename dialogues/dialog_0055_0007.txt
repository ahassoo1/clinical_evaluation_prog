DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Reihner. I am Dr. Eaddy. Please, have a seat. Now, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Thank you. It’s... pain. It’s been painful for a while now. I hoped it would go away on its own, but it hasn’t.
DOCTOR: Pain, you say. Very well. Can you tell me more about this pain, Ms. Reihner?
PATIENT: Yes. It’s in my… lower back. And it goes down my left leg. Not always, but often. It feels like… a sharp ache, mostly. Sometimes it burns. It’s worse when I stand for too long, or if I try to lift something. It makes my work… difficult. I erect fences, you see.
DOCTOR: Erecting fences… a physically demanding profession. I see. And how long has this pain been troubling you, Ms. Reihner?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think... It started… maybe six months ago? Small at first. I just thought I’d pulled a muscle. But it hasn’t gotten better. It’s been… steadily worse over those six months. It’s hard to say exactly. Time… slips away.
DOCTOR: Six months… quite a while to endure discomfort. Has anything specific aggravated it, aside from standing and lifting?
PATIENT: Well... the weather. Cold, damp weather makes it much, much worse. And… bending over. Definitely bending over. I have to be very careful how I move now. It’s… frustrating. I used to be able to do anything.
DOCTOR: I understand. And you mentioned the damp weather… does heat provide any relief?
PATIENT: Yes, actually. Heat helps. A warm bath, or… a heating pad. It doesn't make it go away, but it eases the ache for a little while. Not a lot, but enough to get through the day sometimes.
DOCTOR: Very good. Now, Ms. Reihner, I'd like to ask you a few questions about other areas of your health. Have you experienced any numbness or tingling in your legs or feet?
PATIENT: Yes, sometimes. In my left foot, mostly. It feels… like pins and needles. Not all the time, but when the pain is bad, there’s usually some numbness too. It comes and goes. It doesn’t last long, thankfully. But it’s… unsettling.
DOCTOR: I see. And have you noticed any weakness in your legs or feet?
PATIENT: Weakness… hmm. It's hard to say. I feel tired more easily, if that makes sense. Like my legs just… give out after a long day. But I don’t know if that’s just from working hard, or if it’s… something else. I haven't actually dropped anything, if that’s what you mean.
DOCTOR: That is useful information, Ms. Reihner. Now, let's move on to your medical history. Have you ever had any previous surgeries or hospitalizations?
PATIENT: No. Never. I’ve always been… healthy, mostly. A few colds, the usual things. But no surgeries. No hospital stays. I’ve been very lucky, I think. Until this.
DOCTOR: Good. And what about medical conditions in your family?
PATIENT: That's… a difficult question. My mother… she had arthritis, I believe. Badly, when she got older. And my father… he had problems with his heart. But… that was a long time ago. I don’t know much about it, to be honest. We didn’t talk about such things much. I don’t think anyone else in my family had anything… similar to this.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, Ms. Reihner, I'd like to perform a brief physical examination to assess your condition. Is that agreeable to you?
PATIENT: Yes. Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you think is best. I want to know what’s going on, if you can tell me. And if you can fix it.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you'll please follow me. We'll begin with your range of motion and reflexes, and then I'll palpate your back to assess the source of the pain. Please lie down on your back, Ms. Reihner. Okay, Ms. Reihner, tell me if you feel any pain when I press here… and here… Alright… and now can you lift your leg up like this?
PATIENT: Yes… Ooh, that’s… tender. Right there. And… yes, that’s it. Lifting my leg… It’s… difficult. And it hurts a little more when I lift it straight up. It feels… tight.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Reihner. And what about bending forward?
PATIENT: Oh… It’s… very painful. Like something is pulling. I can’t go much further. It’s… no. I can’t. It’s just too much. It feels like it will… snap something.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Reihner. That is enough for now. Based on your description of the pain, the physical examination, and your medical history, it appears you are experiencing symptoms consistent with lumbar radiculopathy, likely caused by compression of a nerve root in your lower back. However, to confirm this diagnosis and rule out other potential causes, I would like to order some imaging studies – specifically, an MRI of your lumbar spine. Would that be agreeable to you?
PATIENT: An… MRI? What does that… do? Will it hurt? I don’t like… being closed in. And I’ve never had one before. Is it… expensive?
DOCTOR: That’s a perfectly reasonable question, Ms. Reihner. An MRI—Magnetic Resonance Imaging—uses strong magnets and radio waves to create detailed images of the structures within your spine. It's a non-invasive procedure, meaning it doesn't involve any cutting or injections. You will lie on a table that slides into a large machine, and it can be a bit noisy and enclosed, as you mentioned. We can provide you with earplugs and a sedative to help you relax if you are anxious. As for the cost, Medicare should cover a significant portion of the procedure, but there may be a co-pay or deductible depending on your plan. Our billing department can provide you with a precise estimate. It's crucial to obtain these images to determine the exact cause of your pain and develop an appropriate treatment plan. Would you like me to provide you with more information about the procedure, or perhaps schedule a consultation with the radiology technician who will perform the scan?
PATIENT: A sedative… yes, that sounds… good. If it will help me stay calm. And Medicare will cover it? I don't want to be surprised with a huge bill. What kind of treatment… if it is a compressed nerve? Will I need… surgery?
DOCTOR: Yes, Medicare generally covers diagnostic imaging like MRIs for medically necessary conditions. Our billing department will verify your specific coverage details and provide you with a cost estimate before the procedure. As for treatment, the vast majority of patients with lumbar radiculopathy do not require surgery. Initial treatment typically involves conservative measures such as physical therapy, pain management techniques—including medication and injections—and lifestyle modifications to reduce pressure on the nerve. Surgery is generally reserved for cases that do not respond to conservative treatment or involve significant neurological deficits. I would like to schedule you for an MRI as soon as possible, and then we can discuss a comprehensive treatment plan based on the results. Does that sound agreeable to you?
PATIENT: Yes… that sounds… alright. As long as I don’t have to rush into anything. And… the sedative. Please… schedule the MRI. And… can you tell me what I need to do to prepare for it? Will I have to… take anything off?
DOCTOR: Certainly. I'll have my nurse schedule the MRI for you immediately. She will provide you with detailed instructions on how to prepare for the procedure. Generally, you will need to remove any metal objects, such as jewelry, watches, and hearing aids, before the scan. You will also need to inform the technician if you have any implants or medical devices. Before you leave today, I will also provide you with a prescription for a muscle relaxant to help alleviate some of your pain and discomfort. I also recommend avoiding strenuous activity and bending over as much as possible. Do you have any other questions or concerns before we wrap up today, Ms. Reihner?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s… everything. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve… explained everything very clearly. And the sedative makes me feel… better. I appreciate your patience. .
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Ms. Reihner. It is my pleasure to assist you. Remember, we are here to support you throughout this process. Please do not hesitate to contact our office if you have any questions or concerns. My nurse will be in shortly to discuss the MRI scheduling and provide you with your prescription. Have a good day, Ms. Reihner, and I look forward to seeing you again soon. .
