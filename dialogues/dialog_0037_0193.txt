DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Goodstein. My name is Dr. Octavis AX. It’s good to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is a pleasure to meet you as well. Well, it is… a little embarrassing, to be honest. But I have been having… a lot of gas. More than usual, you see. It is causing me some… discomfort.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Goodstein, no need to be embarrassed. Digestive issues are very common, and we can certainly look into what’s going on. When did you first start noticing this increase in gas?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think carefully. It started… perhaps three weeks ago? Around July 10th, I believe. Yes, that sounds right. I was having a small get-together with some friends from the bakery, and it began shortly after that. I ate a new kind of… pastry, a poppy seed strudel. Perhaps it is related?
DOCTOR: That’s helpful information, thank you. Around July 10th, and you suspect the poppy seed strudel. We’ll definitely keep that in mind. Can you describe the discomfort you're experiencing?
PATIENT: It is… a bloating feeling, mostly. Like I am very full, even when I have not eaten much. And… well, the gas itself is quite… noticeable. It comes and goes, but when it comes, it is… strong, you understand. It doesn’t cause sharp pain, just… pressure and a feeling of being… unsettled. It is most bothersome after I eat, usually within an hour or so.
DOCTOR: Okay, bloating and pressure, especially after eating, and occurring within an hour of meals. No sharp pain, which is good. Have you noticed any other symptoms alongside the gas and bloating?
PATIENT: Let me consider… Yes, actually. Now that you mention it, I have been… a little tired. Not sick tired, just… more sluggish than usual. And… my stomach makes noises. More noises than it used to. Like rumbling and… gurgling. It is somewhat embarrassing to admit, but there it is. And, one more thing… I have been going to the restroom… more frequently, to… well, to relieve gas, naturally. It is not diarrhea, just… more often than my usual schedule.
DOCTOR: Okay, so fatigue, increased stomach noises—rumbling and gurgling—and more frequent bowel movements for gas relief. Not diarrhea, thankfully. Let’s get a bit more detail on your diet. Aside from the poppy seed strudel, has anything else changed in what you're eating or drinking lately?
PATIENT: No, not really. I try to keep a fairly regular diet. I work at the fast food place, so I eat some of what we serve, of course – mostly the chicken sandwiches, a small fry occasionally. But I also eat at home – soups, sometimes pasta, bread… nothing particularly unusual. I drink mostly water, and a small coffee in the morning. I haven’t started any new foods or beverages recently, aside from that strudel three weeks ago. I am a simple man with simple tastes, you see.
DOCTOR: Okay, fairly consistent diet, mostly water and a small coffee. Let's talk about your medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Not that I am aware of, Doctor. I have Medicare, so I have seen doctors over the years for check-ups. They have told me my blood pressure is sometimes a little high, but they said it is nothing to worry about too much if I watch my salt intake. And, years ago, when I was perhaps 20, I had a bad case of the flu, but that is all. Nothing chronic, nothing serious, to my knowledge. I try to be a healthy man, as much as one can be working in my profession.
DOCTOR: Okay, a history of mildly elevated blood pressure and a bout of the flu years ago. No chronic conditions. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything other than the flu?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never. I have been quite fortunate in that regard. I have never needed surgery, and I have never been hospitalized. Just the yearly check-ups, and that one time with the flu when I was very young. My mother always said I was a strong boy. And, thankfully, that has continued into my adult life. No major illnesses, no hospital stays, just… this gas. It is… bothersome, to be sure, but I suppose it could be worse.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. And we'll work to get it sorted out. Now, let’s talk about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family—things like digestive issues, colon cancer, or any other significant illnesses?
PATIENT: Hmm… That is a good question. My mother… she had some stomach trouble when she was older, mostly indigestion, she said. But it was never properly diagnosed, just… discomfort. And my father… he had heart problems, I believe. But that was many years ago, and that runs on his side of the family, not mine. I don’t recall any other significant illnesses in my family. They were mostly… hardworking people, but not particularly… healthy. They didn’t pay much attention to such things, you understand. They were more concerned with putting food on the table.
DOCTOR: Okay, your mother had some indigestion and your father had heart problems on his side of the family. Let’s move on to your social history. Do you smoke or use tobacco products?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never. I have always avoided tobacco. My mother… she smoked when she was younger, but she warned me about it constantly. Said it was a terrible habit, and that it ruined her lungs. I heeded her advice. I do not smoke, and I do not use any other tobacco products. I prefer fresh air, when I can get it.
DOCTOR: Okay, excellent. Do you drink alcohol, and if so, how much and how often?
PATIENT: Very occasionally, Doctor. I might have a small glass of wine with dinner on a special occasion, perhaps a holiday. But I do not drink regularly. Maybe once a month, if that. I am not a drinker, you see. It doesn't agree with me, and I find I feel much better without it. A glass of water is much more refreshing, in my opinion.
DOCTOR: Okay, very occasional small glass of wine. And finally, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing. I try to avoid medications as much as possible. I have a small bottle of aspirin for headaches, but I rarely use it. And, no, I do not take any supplements or vitamins. I believe in eating a balanced diet, when I can, and that is usually sufficient. I am a simple man, as I mentioned, and I prefer to keep things simple when it comes to my health as well. No medications, no supplements, just… this gas. It is a bit perplexing, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: It is, Mr. Goodstein. Let's do a quick physical exam. I'd like to listen to your abdomen and feel for any tenderness. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that is perfectly alright. I trust your judgment. Please, proceed. I am happy to cooperate in any way that might help determine the cause of this… discomfort. I have nothing to hide, you understand. I just want to feel better.
DOCTOR: Okay. I’m listening to your abdomen now. Your bowel sounds are… a little active, louder than normal, but that’s consistent with increased gas. I don’t feel any significant tenderness when I press, which is good. No masses or guarding. Your heart sounds are regular, and your lungs are clear. Blood pressure is 138/82, a little elevated but within a reasonable range. Overall, the physical exam doesn't reveal anything alarming. Given your history, the timing of the symptoms in relation to the poppy seed strudel, and the findings of the physical exam, it’s likely we’re dealing with increased intestinal gas, possibly related to a temporary change in your gut microbiome. The poppy seeds themselves can sometimes contribute to this. However, to rule out other possibilities, I would like to order a stool test to check for any infections or inflammation. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: That sounds… sensible, Doctor. A stool test. Yes, that is perfectly alright with me. If it will help determine the cause of this… problem, then I am happy to cooperate. Poppy seeds, you say? I had not considered that. It is strange that something so… delightful could cause such discomfort. But I trust your judgment. Yes, please, proceed with the stool test. And thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your thoroughness. I feel… a little relieved knowing we are taking steps to find the cause of this.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Goodstein. I'll have the lab draw the sample. We should have the results back in about 3-5 business days. In the meantime, I recommend over-the-counter simethicone, which can help reduce gas. Follow the package directions, of course. And try to avoid foods that you know tend to cause gas, like beans, broccoli, and carbonated beverages. We’ll also revisit your diet to identify other potential triggers. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly reasonable. Simethicone… I believe I have seen that in the store. I will try that. And I will certainly avoid beans and broccoli. I do enjoy a fizzy drink occasionally, but I can refrain for a few days. I appreciate your recommendations. It is reassuring to have a plan of action. And… if the stool test does not reveal anything, what then, Doctor? What other possibilities might there be? I do not mean to be… a bother, but I like to be prepared.
DOCTOR: You're not a bother at all, Mr. Goodstein. It's good to be informed. If the stool test is negative, we'd consider other possibilities, such as lactose intolerance, fructose malabsorption, or even small intestinal bacterial overgrowth, or SIBO. Those require further testing. We could discuss a trial of a low-FODMAP diet, which is a temporary elimination diet to help identify trigger foods. Or, if the symptoms persist, we could consider a referral to a gastroenterologist for further evaluation, possibly including a breath test or endoscopy. But let’s not jump ahead just yet. Let’s see what the stool test reveals first. We’ll take things one step at a time. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds… quite alright. One step at a time. I appreciate your patience and your thoroughness. Low-FODMAP diet… that sounds… complicated. But I am willing to try anything that might help. I am thankful for your expertise. And, if it is not too much trouble, could you perhaps write down those terms – lactose intolerance, fructose malabsorption, SIBO, low-FODMAP – just so I can refer to them later? My memory is… fairly good, but it is always helpful to have a reminder. Thank you again, Doctor. I feel much better knowing we have a plan.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Goodstein. Here you go. Lactose intolerance – that’s a difficulty digesting milk sugar. Fructose malabsorption – that's trouble absorbing fruit sugar. SIBO, or small intestinal bacterial overgrowth, is an overgrowth of bacteria in the small intestine. And the low-FODMAP diet is a temporary elimination diet to help identify trigger foods. I’ll also provide you with a handout about simethicone and some general dietary recommendations for managing gas. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I believe that is everything. You have been most helpful and thorough. I appreciate your patience and your willingness to explain everything so clearly. I feel… considerably relieved, and hopeful. I will follow your instructions carefully and await the results of the stool test. And… if the symptoms worsen before then, I will contact the office, of course. Thank you again, Doctor AX. I appreciate your time and your expertise. And… have a good day.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Goodstein. I’m glad I could help. Don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns. And you have a good day as well. .
