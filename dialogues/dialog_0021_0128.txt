DOCTOR: Hello, Lilliana. I'm Dr. Havird. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It's… my joints, I think? They get really stiff in the mornings. It’s just… hard to get going, you know? It's been happening for a while now, I guess. Not sure exactly how long, to be honest. Things just… blur these days.
DOCTOR: Right. "Blur these days," yes. Well, stiffness in the mornings is… common. How long are we talking when you say "a while?
PATIENT: Oh dear… hmm. Let me think. Maybe… six months? Or was it a year? It feels like a long time, but honestly, time just slips away. I mostly notice it when I'm trying to… well, pick things up, or get out of bed. It's not a sharp pain, just… everything feels tight and slow. Does that make sense? I’m sorry, I’m probably not being very helpful.
DOCTOR: It's... fine. Six months to a year of stiffness. And is this stiffness… in all your joints, or just certain ones?
PATIENT: Oh, good question! I think… mostly my hands and knees. Sometimes my back too, but that could just be… getting old, I suppose. My fingers are the worst, definitely. Makes it hard to… do anything with them, really. Like buttoning my coat, or opening jars. It's silly little things, you know? Not a terrible pain, just… frustrating. I don’t remember anything specific happening that started it, if that helps.
DOCTOR: “Silly little things.” Right. Well, frustrating is one way to put it. Do you notice any swelling or redness in those joints, particularly in the mornings when you’re stiff?
PATIENT: Hmm… swelling? Now that you mention it… maybe a little? I haven't really looked, to be honest. I just feel the stiffness. Redness… no, I don’t think so. My hands look… normal, I suppose. I mean, they’re a bit wrinkly, but that's just from age, right? It’s hard to tell, really. I don’t bend over to look at my knees much either. Sorry, I wish I could be more helpful! I’m not very good at noticing these things.
DOCTOR: Alright. No swelling or redness noticed. And have you tried anything for this stiffness?
PATIENT: Oh, yes! My friend, Maria, she told me to take some… ibuprofen? Is that right? The white pills. It helps a little, I think. But not much, and I forget to take it half the time. Honestly, I’m just trying to get through the day. I mostly just… move slowly and try not to bother it. I’m not really one for taking a lot of pills. I prefer just… dealing with it.
DOCTOR: Dealing with it. Well, that’s… a strategy. How much ibuprofen were you taking, and how often?
PATIENT: Oh dear… that's a good question. Um… two pills? Maybe? When I remember. It’s probably not very regular. A couple of times a week, I think. Sometimes more if it’s really bad. I don’t really pay attention to the bottle, I just… take some when it hurts. Sorry, I know that's not a very good answer. I'm just not good with remembering things like that. I mostly just try to ignore it.
DOCTOR: Ignoring things rarely makes them go away. Okay. Let’s move on. Have you had any other medical problems, Lilliana?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That's… a big question. Let me think. My husband, bless his soul, he always took care of all that. I… I had my gallbladder out, a long time ago. And my blood pressure is a little high, I think? The doctor told me once, but I don't really worry about it. I’m pretty healthy, overall, I think. Just… old. And a bit creaky, now. Is that helpful? I’m really sorry, I'm not very good at this.
DOCTOR: Gallbladder removed and high blood pressure. Are you currently taking any medications for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh, yes! Yes, I think so. Little white pills again. I take them every morning, I think. With my breakfast. They're… a small pill. I really don't pay attention to what they're for, honestly. My husband used to sort all that out for me and fill a little pill organizer every week. I just take whatever's in there. Sorry, I wish I could tell you the name, but I really have no idea. Is that okay?
DOCTOR: “Whatever’s in there.” Right. Okay. And do you have any allergies to medications, or anything else for that matter?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, allergies… hmm. Let me think. I don't think so. I used to get a little rash from poison ivy when I was a little girl, but that was a long time ago! And I'm not sure if it counts, but I can't eat shellfish, it just… doesn’t agree with me. Makes me feel very unwell. But not like an allergy, exactly. More like… my stomach doesn't like it. Do you need me to be more specific? I'm really trying to remember, but things just… aren’t as clear as they used to be. Sorry.
DOCTOR: No shellfish. Alright. Let's do a quick physical exam. Can you stand up for me, please?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. Just give me a moment… There we go. A little creaky, as you can see. But I'm standing! Just be gentle, please. My knees aren’t what they used to be.
DOCTOR: Okay. Let me just check your range of motion. Can you make a fist for me?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Of course. Like this? It's a little stiff, as you can see. Not as good as it used to be. It feels… tight. Does that make sense? It’s not painful, just… doesn’t go as far as it once did. I hope that’s okay.
DOCTOR: Hmm. And can you open and close your hands for me a few times?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, certainly. Like this? It's a bit… slow, as you can see. And feels a little… rough. I haven't been doing much with my hands lately. Just… mostly resting. Is that alright? It doesn't hurt too much, just… uncomfortable. A little bit of clicking too, I think. Do you hear it? It's probably nothing, though.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now let’s check your knees. Can you bend them for me?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, certainly. Like this? It's a little stiff, as you can see. And feels… creaky. It's not a sharp pain, just… uncomfortable. I haven’t been doing much walking lately, so they’re probably just a little rusty. I hope that’s alright. Do you want me to go further? I don’t want to push myself too much. I’m a bit worried about falling.
DOCTOR: No, that’s enough. Okay. Based on what you've told me, and the brief exam, it sounds like you likely have some osteoarthritis, particularly in your hands and knees. It's very common, especially as we get older.
PATIENT: Oh… osteoarthritis? That sounds… serious. Is it… bad? What does that mean? I just thought I was getting old and creaky! Will I be able to… do things? I still like to garden, you know. And I enjoy a little bit of walking. Is this going to stop me from doing those things? I'm a bit worried now, to be honest.
DOCTOR: It’s not necessarily “serious” in the sense of life-threatening. It just means the cartilage in your joints is wearing down. It’s why you’re feeling the stiffness and discomfort. As for stopping you from gardening and walking... not immediately. But if left unmanaged, it can limit your range of motion and cause more pain. We can try some things to help. I recommend continuing the ibuprofen, as needed, but try to take it regularly - not just when it hurts, to keep the inflammation down. Also, gentle exercise, like walking or swimming, can help keep your joints mobile. I'm going to give you a referral to a physical therapist who can show you some exercises.
PATIENT: Oh… that sounds… good. I think. A physical therapist… that’s helpful. I can try to be more regular with the pills, I suppose. It’s just hard to remember! And I do like a little bit of walking. Not too much, though. Will the pain get worse, even with the pills and the exercise? I don’t want to be stuck in bed all day. And I don’t want to bother my neighbor for help all the time. She’s very kind, but… she has her own things to worry about.
DOCTOR: It's difficult to say for certain. Everyone's different. The goal is to slow down the progression. If the ibuprofen isn’t enough, we can discuss some stronger medications, but I prefer to start with the least invasive options first. We can reassess in a few months to see how you’re doing. I'll write you a prescription for a higher dosage of ibuprofen, and the referral to physical therapy. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Oh… okay. Higher dosage… and the physical therapy. That sounds like a lot. Will the physical therapy be… painful? I don’t want to make it worse. And will I need a ride? I don’t drive anymore, you know. And… what if it doesn’t work? I'm a bit scared now, to be honest. This is all a bit overwhelming. I just wanted something for my stiff joints! Is there anything else I can do? Maybe a cream or something?
DOCTOR: The physical therapy shouldn't be painful, it will be more… discomfort. They’ll start slowly and gradually increase the intensity. And yes, you'll likely need a ride. As for other options, there are creams, topical NSAIDs, but they’re often not as effective as the oral medication. We can try one if the ibuprofen isn't sufficient. Look, osteoarthritis is a common condition, and we’ll manage it. I'm going to write you a handout with some information about it. Focus on the ibuprofen and getting to the physical therapy. We'll see how you do and adjust from there. Any other questions before I need to see the next patient?
PATIENT: Oh… okay. Ibuprofen and the physical therapy. I think… that’s all for now. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been… very helpful, even if it’s a little scary. I hope I can remember everything you’ve said! Maybe I should write it down. I’ll try my best. Thank you again. Where do I go to get the handout and the prescription?
DOCTOR: The nurse will give you the handout and the prescription on your way out. Just let her know you need them. Have a good day. .
PATIENT: .
