DOCTOR: Hi Demondre, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Yoshino. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hi Dr. Yoshino, good to meet you too. Uh, well, it’s kinda just a check-up, I guess? I don't really need anything, just wanted to see how things are going. I haven’t been to a doctor in a while.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's great – preventative care is really important! It's good you're thinking about this now. Even without a specific concern, it's helpful to get a baseline and make sure everything's running smoothly. To get started, could you tell me a little bit about your general health?
PATIENT: Sure. I work on boats, mostly. Sailor and, like, oil stuff. It's pretty physical, you know? I try to eat okay, but it's hard when you're always traveling. I sleep alright, I think. Not amazing, but not bad. I had a divorce a few years back, so... that was stressful for a bit, but I'm doing better now. Is that the kinda thing you need to know?
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely, that’s all really helpful information, Demondre. Thanks for sharing. Knowing about your work – being a sailor and doing oil work – gives me a good picture of your activity level and potential exposures. And life events like a divorce absolutely affect your health, so it’s good you mentioned that. Stress takes a toll, and it’s good to hear you’re doing better now. Just to clarify, when you say "sleep alright," can you tell me roughly how many hours you usually get a night?
PATIENT: Um… usually around six, maybe seven. Some nights less if the waves are bad or somethin’. It’s not always the best sleep, you know? Like, I wake up a lot. But I’m used to it, I guess.
DOCTOR: Okay, six to seven hours, sometimes interrupted. That's good to know. Getting consistently restful sleep is important, and it sounds like that might be something we want to explore a bit further. Let's talk a little about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, asthma, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nah, not really. I broke my arm when I was a kid, but that's about it. And I get seasick sometimes, but… that doesn’t count, does it? I’ve never been told I have anything wrong with me. My ex-wife always said I was too stubborn to get sick.
DOCTOR: No, breaking your arm and occasional seasickness don't count as medical conditions in this context. It’s good to hear you haven’t been diagnosed with anything. And you're right to mention that your ex-wife said you were stubborn – sometimes people do push through things! Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Nope. Never. I try to avoid hospitals if I can, to be honest. Not a fan.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly understandable. Many people feel that way. So, no surgeries, which is good to know. Now, let’s talk about your family. Do you have a family history of any significant medical conditions – things like heart disease, cancer, diabetes, or anything else that runs in your family?
PATIENT: Um… my mom had high blood pressure, I think. And her mom, my grandma, had something with her heart. But other than that, not really. My dad’s side, I don’t know much about, to be honest. He wasn't around much.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of high blood pressure in your mom and a heart condition in your grandmother. That's helpful to know. We’ll keep those in mind. It's okay that you don't know much about your dad's side – family history isn't always easy to come by. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope, not that I know of. I eat pretty much everything. I get a little itchy sometimes after being in the sun too long, but I just use lotion.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies, just some mild sun sensitivity. That’s good. And finally, are you currently taking any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Nah. Just… sometimes I take something for my back when it's acting up, but it's just ibuprofen, you know? Nothing regular.
DOCTOR: Okay, just ibuprofen as needed for your back. That's good to know. Alright, Demondre, that gives me a really good start. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's okay with you. We'll check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, take a look in your ears, and do a basic neurological check. It shouldn’t take too long. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds alright. Whatever you need to do.
DOCTOR: .
