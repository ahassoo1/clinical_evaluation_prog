DOCTOR: Well, good morning, Jimmi. I’m Dr. Fourney. So, you're 73, and I see here you're Chamorro... right. Let’s get straight to it. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. Yes, Jimmi is right. It’s… well, it's a problem down there. A messy problem. Not nice at all, you know? I don’t usually talk about this… but it’s been going on. A few days now, I think. Maybe longer. Hard to say.
DOCTOR: "Down there," you say. Right. Well, we all have those… issues eventually. A few days, maybe longer… that's not terribly helpful, Jimmi. We need to be precise if I’m going to help you. Is this a new problem, or have you dealt with something like this before?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. I don't remember ever having this before. Not that I recall. Things aren't so clear these days, you know? Old age. It comes for us all. I just… noticed it. It’s… discharge, you said? That’s a fancy word for it, isn’t it? It's not like a normal thing, I wouldn't think. A gentleman friend… once… but that was a long time ago. And very different. This is… icky.
DOCTOR: Right, "icky." Well, let’s try to get a clearer picture. So, you’re saying this is a new discharge, and it’s not related to any previous… activities. And you're sure it's not something you've experienced before?
PATIENT: Positive. I… I haven't been with anyone for a good long while. Years, maybe. I keep to myself mostly. Painting, you know? Keeps my hands busy. So it's definitely new. And it's… well, it’s not a pretty sight. And it smells funny. Not like flowers, that’s for sure. Is this something serious, Doctor? I don’t want to be… dying or anything.
DOCTOR: Dying?
PATIENT: Well, you never know, do you? Everything these days seems to be catching something! I see young people on the television… all sorts of illnesses. And things you catch… down there. I just thought… a discharge, it sounds bad. It’s probably nothing, I hope. But a lady has to be careful, right? I don’t want any… complications. Are you going to look at it? I always thought doctors didn't like looking at… those parts.
DOCTOR: Look, Jimmi, you're getting ahead of yourself. I am a doctor, and looking at things is part of my job. And no, this doesn't automatically mean you're dying. Though your anxiety isn’t helping. Yes, I’m going to need to examine you. It's the only way to determine the cause of this discharge. We'll need to rule out infection or something else. Do you have any allergies to latex or any sensitivities I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Oh. Well, alright. If you have to. Latex… hmm. I don't think so. I used to paint with oils, mostly. Never used those rubber gloves, not me. Felt clumsy. Oils are better, you know? More natural. But I might have… once… used a rubber band. A long time ago. Didn't bother me. But I’ve got sensitive skin, generally. Things can… irritate me, easily. Especially strong smells. Like perfume. And cleaning products. Makes me cough. Is that important, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Sensitive skin and a cough… noted. It’s good you mentioned that. We'll use fragrance-free lubricant and be mindful of strong odors during the exam. Alright, if you'll just get on the examination table, face up, and put the paper gown on, we can get started. I’ll need you to bend your knees. I'll be right back with the speculum and lubricant. And please, try to relax. The more tense you are, the more difficult this will be.
PATIENT: Oh dear. A speculum? That sounds… unpleasant. I suppose I have no choice. But don’t go poking around too much, Doctor. I am an artist, you know. I need my delicate parts intact. And please, hurry. This is… embarrassing. And drafty in here, isn't it? I feel a chill.
DOCTOR: Right. We'll be as quick and gentle as possible, Jimmi. It's necessary for a proper examination. I’m going to use this lubricant to make things more comfortable, and then I'll gently insert the speculum to visualize the area. It might feel a little uncomfortable, but it shouldn't be painful. If you feel any sharp pain, tell me immediately. Just breathe deeply. Now, if you could relax your legs as much as possible...
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. It is cold. And… slippery! I haven't been this vulnerable since… well, since I was a teenager, probably. Just… be careful, Doctor. Very careful. And hurry, please. This is… a lot. I’m an artist, remember? My body is my instrument. Don't… break it.
DOCTOR: Alright, just a moment… breathing deeply, that's right. I’m just taking a look now... Hmm. I see some inflammation and a purulent discharge. It appears to be a yellowish-green color. It’s also has a distinct odor, as you mentioned. Not a normal discharge at all. It looks like you might have a case of bacterial vaginosis. I’ll need to send a sample of this discharge to the lab to confirm the diagnosis, but it appears to be the most likely cause. Is that comfortable?
PATIENT: Oh! That was… quick. And a bit… rude! Bacterial… what-now? Is that… serious? Will I need… shots? Or pills? I don’t like pills. They make me nauseous. And what about my painting? Can I still paint? I have a commission, you know. A very important one! A portrait of Mrs. Abernathy’s poodle… she’s very particular. And does this mean… I can’t… see anyone?
DOCTOR: Look, Jimmi, bacterial vaginosis is a common infection. It’s not life-threatening. It’s treatable with antibiotics, usually either a pill or a cream. It's not something you "catch" from anyone, so there's no need to worry about that. And yes, you can absolutely continue painting! It won’t affect your ability to work. The pills are usually well-tolerated, but we can discuss cream if you're concerned about nausea. Now, let’s get the lab work ordered so we can confirm the diagnosis and start you on the appropriate treatment. And frankly, I don’t need a detailed account of your social life. Just let me do my job.
PATIENT: Oh. Well. That’s… reassuring, I suppose. Though I didn’t give you a detailed account! I was just… explaining. Still. Cream sounds better than pills. Definitely better. I get motion sickness, you see. Even looking at the ocean makes me queasy. And I don't want to be sick while I’m painting Mrs. Abernathy’s poodle. She’s a very discerning client. So, cream. And how long will it take? Will I have to come back? And… is it contagious? To my paintbrushes? I wouldn't want to infect them!
DOCTOR: Look, Jimmi. It is not contagious to your paintbrushes. Paintbrushes are inanimate objects! It's a vaginal infection, not a…paintbrush plague. The cream is applied vaginally, usually once a day for a week. You will need to come back for a follow-up exam in a week to ensure the infection has cleared. And yes, you can continue painting during treatment, just…wash your hands thoroughly after application. Now, let me print out the instructions and a prescription for the cream. I'm sending you home with a detailed pamphlet, and if you have any further concerns about your paintbrushes, please consult an art supply specialist.
PATIENT: Oh. You’re right, of course. Silly of me. Paintbrushes. Well. Thank you, Doctor. For… explaining. And for not laughing. It’s just… a lot to take in. Especially at my age. A week, you say? That should give me enough time to finish Mrs. Abernathy's poodle. She's very particular about the fluffiness of the ears. Is there anything else I should know? About… precautions, or diet, or anything?
DOCTOR: Just follow the instructions carefully. Avoid douching and scented feminine hygiene products. And honestly, a healthy diet and plenty of fluids are always a good idea. But there's no specific diet related to this infection. And… try to relax. Stress can weaken your immune system, making it harder to fight off infection. Now, if you don’t have any other questions, I have other patients waiting. You can schedule your follow-up appointment at the front desk. Have a good day.
PATIENT: Oh. Right. Yes, well. Thank you again, Doctor. For everything. I suppose that's all. Stress, you say? Yes, well, Mrs. Abernathy is very particular. I'll try to relax. Perhaps I'll paint a seascape. Though it might make me queasy. Good day to you, too, Doctor. Paintbrushes… Honestly.
