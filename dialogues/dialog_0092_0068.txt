DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Queener. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Giganti. It’s a pleasure to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, it’s this… swelling. It’s in my leg, mostly. It started after… after the cancer stuff. The treatments, you know? It’s a bit bothersome.
DOCTOR: I see. The swelling in your leg started after your cancer treatments. Thank you for letting me know. To help me understand a little better, could you tell me which cancer treatments you received?
PATIENT: Oh… um… lots of… things. Chemo, I think? And… radiation. Yes, radiation too. It was a long time ago, honestly. I don’t remember everything exactly. It was at the hospital in… well, I can't recall the name right now. Does that help?
DOCTOR: Yes, that does help. Chemotherapy and radiation – thank you. And it was some time ago. It’s perfectly alright that you don’t recall all the details. We can try to access those records if you'd like. While I do that, could you describe the swelling itself?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, please look at the records. My memory… it’s not what it used to be. The swelling… it’s mostly in my right leg, I think. It feels… heavy, you know? And sometimes it’s… kinda tight. It’s worse at the end of the day, after I’ve been on my feet. It goes down a little when I… when I put my leg up. Is that… helpful?
DOCTOR: That's very helpful, Ms. Queener. Heavy and tight, worse at the end of the day, and improves with elevation. That gives me a good starting point. I’ve located some of your records from City General Hospital. It looks like you completed chemotherapy and radiation for breast cancer approximately five years ago. The notes mention some lymphedema risk discussed at the time. Now, to get a more complete picture, could you tell me about any other symptoms you’re experiencing?
PATIENT: Oh, five years ago… yes, that sounds right. City General… yes. Lymp-what? I don’t remember that word. Other symptoms… hmm. Not really. Just… tired sometimes. And a little achy, like an old woman, you know? Nothing major. Mostly just the leg. It’s just… annoying. I can't wear my good shoes anymore.
DOCTOR: I understand. “Lymphedema” is swelling that can sometimes occur after cancer treatment, particularly after removing or treating lymph nodes. It’s caused by a buildup of fluid. Tiredness and aches, in addition to the leg swelling. Do you notice any changes in the skin on your leg—color, texture, temperature?
PATIENT: Oh… skin changes… hmm. Let me see… It feels… kinda rough, maybe? Not smooth like my other leg. And… I think it’s a little bit darker, maybe? It’s hard to tell, I don’t look at my legs much. They’re not very… pretty. Is that important?
DOCTOR: It is important, Ms. Queener. Rough skin and a slightly darker color are things we’ll want to take note of. Alright, I’d like to take a look at your leg now, if you don’t mind. Could you please sit on the examination table, and I’ll have you extend your legs?
PATIENT: Oh, okay. Yes, that’s fine. It’s a little cold in here, isn't it?
DOCTOR: Yes, my apologies. Let me just take a look… Okay, I’m noting some clear swelling in your right leg, particularly around your calf and ankle. The skin feels slightly thickened and warmer to the touch compared to your left leg. The circumference is about 3 centimeters larger at your mid-calf and 2 centimeters larger at your ankle. I don’t see any open sores or signs of infection at this time. I’m also checking your pulses… good pulses in both feet. Do you experience any pain with this swelling?
PATIENT: Oh… centimeters… that's a lot of numbers. No, no pain, really. Just… heavy. And sometimes a little… uncomfortable. Like a tight stocking, you know? It’s not sharp or anything. Just… there. Does that make sense? I just want to be able to wear my shoes again. That’s all.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Ms. Queener. Heavy and uncomfortable, like a tight stocking, but no sharp pain. I appreciate you describing it so clearly. Based on your history and my examination, it does sound like you are experiencing lymphedema in your right leg, likely related to your previous cancer treatment. However, to rule out other potential causes, such as a blood clot or venous insufficiency, I’d like to order a Duplex Ultrasound of your leg. This is a non-invasive test that will look at the blood flow in your veins and arteries. Would you be agreeable to that?
PATIENT: Oh… a Duplex what-now? Sounds… complicated. Is it painful? I don’t really like tests. But… if it will help me wear my shoes… yes, I guess so. As long as it doesn’t take too long. I have a lunch date with my friend, Sylvie. She makes a lovely quiche.
DOCTOR: A Duplex Ultrasound is very straightforward, Ms. Queener. It’s completely painless. A technician will apply a gel to your leg and use a handheld device to create images of the blood vessels on a screen. It usually takes about 30 to 45 minutes. I’ll order it for you now. We can schedule it at the imaging center across the street. They usually have same-day appointments available. While we wait for the results, I also recommend starting some simple measures to help manage the swelling. Elevating your leg whenever possible, wearing compression stockings, and gentle exercise can all be beneficial. I can provide you with a referral to a physical therapist specializing in lymphedema management. Would you be interested in that as well?
PATIENT: Oh, a physical therapist? That sounds… like a lot of work. But… if it helps with the shoes… yes, okay. Maybe. Compression stockings… are they comfortable? I don’t like things that squeeze. And I suppose I can put my leg up. It’s just… inconvenient. But… okay. If you think it will help. I just want to wear my good shoes again. That’s all.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Queener. It’s perfectly alright to feel a little overwhelmed. We’ll take things one step at a time. I’ll write a referral for a physical therapist specializing in lymphedema. They can help you find the right type of compression stocking and teach you exercises that are comfortable and effective. Here’s the referral. The number is on the paper, and they can schedule an appointment directly. The results from the Ultrasound should be available within 24 hours. I’ll have my nurse contact you to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and create a more comprehensive plan. In the meantime, if you experience any sudden pain, redness, or warmth in your leg, please contact us immediately. Do you have any questions for me before you leave?
