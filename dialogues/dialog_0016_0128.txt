DOCTOR: Hello Lilliana, welcome to the clinic. It’s lovely to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello. It’s nice to meet you too, Doctor... Maskal, right? Um... well, my joints. They’re just… stiff in the mornings. Really stiff. It takes a while to get moving, you know? I don’t remember exactly when it started, but it’s been a little while now. It's just... annoying.
DOCTOR: Yes, Courtnee Maskal. And please, call me Courtnee. Okay, stiff joints in the mornings… that’s a good place to start. Can you tell me a bit more about where exactly you’re feeling the stiffness?
PATIENT: Hmm… everywhere, kinda? My hands, mostly. And my knees, I think. Maybe my back too? It’s hard to say. It’s not like a sharp pain, just… tight. Like they haven't been used in days, even though I was walking around yesterday. Does that make sense? I'm not very good at explaining things, I apologize.
DOCTOR: It makes perfect sense, Lilliana, no need to apologize at all! It’s helpful you describe it as “tight” rather than sharp. And “everywhere” is a good starting point. When you say it’s been going on “a little while,” could you give me a rough estimate?
PATIENT: Oh dear… a rough estimate… Let me think. Maybe… six months? Or was it a year? It’s all a bit fuzzy, to be honest. My memory isn't what it used to be. It didn’t bother me too much at first, just a little ache. But it's gotten worse lately, I suppose. It takes longer to get going each morning.
DOCTOR: Okay, six months to a year, gradually worsening. That’s very helpful. And you mentioned it takes longer to get going in the mornings. How long would you say that “getting going” process takes now, compared to when it first started?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Well, at first, it was just a few minutes. A little stretch, a bit of a wiggle, and I was okay. Now… now it's probably… half an hour? Sometimes even longer. I have to make a cup of tea and sit down a bit before I can really do anything. It's a bit of a bother, especially when I have things to do. It’s not a lot of pain, but it’s… frustrating.
DOCTOR: Okay, half an hour or more in the mornings, needing a cup of tea to help. I understand that’s frustrating. Now, Lilliana, does anything specifically make it worse?
PATIENT: Hmm… worse… let me think. I don't know if anything makes it worse, exactly. But cold weather definitely doesn’t help. It feels stiffer when it's chilly. And if I’ve been sitting for a long time, like on the sofa watching television, it takes even longer to get moving. I don’t do a lot of… hard work, you know? Just normal things around the house. But that’s about it, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, cold weather and prolonged sitting seem to be factors. And you say normal things around the house—do you notice it affecting your ability to do those things?
PATIENT: Well… not really affecting them, but it makes me less likely to want to do them, if that makes sense? Like, I used to enjoy gardening a little bit, but now I don’t bother as much. It's just… easier to sit down. And I don't want to struggle with it. It's just a bit… disheartening, really. I miss being able to do things without thinking about my joints.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. That sounds disheartening. Okay, let’s move on to some other questions, if you don’t mind. Have you noticed any swelling in your joints, besides the stiffness?
PATIENT: Swelling… Hmm. I don’t think so. Not that I’ve noticed, anyway. My hands sometimes feel a little… puffy, maybe? But I just thought that was because of the heat. It’s been quite warm lately. No real swelling, though. Not like… big and red, or anything. I haven’t noticed that. I don't think so.
DOCTOR: Okay, no significant swelling. And have you experienced any other symptoms along with the stiffness?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… Oh dear. Let me see… I get tired easily, I suppose. But I've always been a bit tired. I don’t know if that’s connected. And sometimes my hands feel a little… numb, maybe? Not all the time, just now and then. It doesn't last long. I don't know if that's something to worry about. I've just been putting it down to getting older.
DOCTOR: Okay, fatigue and occasional numbness in your hands. I appreciate you sharing that. Now, Lilliana, do you have any medical conditions that you’ve been diagnosed with in the past?
PATIENT: Oh… well, let me think. The doctor told me I had… high blood pressure, years ago. But it wasn’t too bad. I took some pills for a while, but he said I could stop. And I had a bad fall a few years back, broke my wrist. But that’s healed now. Nothing else, I don’t think. I have a terrible memory, you know? I apologize if I'm forgetting something important. It's just… a lot to keep track of.
DOCTOR: Okay, high blood pressure in the past and a previous wrist fracture. We'll make a note of both. And don't worry about forgetting things, we'll take our time. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, no. Nothing at all. Not even vitamins. I stopped taking the blood pressure pills a long time ago, like the doctor said. I just have a cup of tea, you know? And maybe a painkiller if I’ve got a headache, but that’s rare. I don’t like taking pills if I can avoid it. They never seem to do much good anyway.
DOCTOR: Okay, no current medications. Now, are you allergic to anything?
PATIENT: Hmm… allergic? Oh, I don't think so. Not that I know of. I haven't had any bad reactions to anything. I used to get a little itchy sometimes when I wore certain fabrics, but that’s just a sensitivity, I think. Nothing serious. No allergies, no. I don't believe so.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Now, could you tell me a little about your family history?
PATIENT: Oh dear. My family… Well, my mother had… arthritis, I think. In her hands. It was very bad towards the end. She was always complaining about it. And my father… he had a bad heart. He didn't live to be very old. That’s about all I remember. My siblings… they were all pretty healthy, as far as I know. It’s been a long time, you know? And I don't really keep in touch with them anymore. It's hard to remember everything.
DOCTOR: Okay, a family history of arthritis and heart disease. And finally, can you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Oh, my lifestyle? Well, it’s pretty quiet, to be honest. I live alone since my husband passed away. I mostly stay at home. I like to watch television and read. I don't go out much. I used to garden a little bit, but I don't do that anymore. I don't smoke, and I don’t drink much alcohol. Just a glass of wine with dinner sometimes. It's a pretty simple life, really. Not very exciting.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lilliana. Thank you for sharing all of that information with me. It’s very helpful. I’m going to do a quick physical exam now, if that's alright. I'll be checking your joints for tenderness, range of motion, and any signs of swelling. It shouldn't take long. Would you mind if I started with your hands?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, that’s fine. Hands are good. Go ahead. It doesn’t sound too bad. I hope it doesn’t take too long, though. I do have a bit of an appointment later this afternoon. Not important, really, just a chat with a neighbor. But still…
DOCTOR: Okay, Lilliana, I’m just checking the tenderness and range of motion in your hands. I notice some mild tenderness on both sides of the knuckles and wrists when I press. And your range of motion is slightly limited, especially when extending your fingers fully. There’s no significant swelling, as you mentioned. Now, let’s check your knees. Could you please bend them for me?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. This is a bit awkward, isn’t it? Yes, here we go… Ooh, that’s a bit… stiff. Yes, that’s definitely stiffer than my hands. It’s not a sharp pain, just… tight. And it makes a little… clicking sound, I think. I don’t remember it clicking before. I hope it’s not anything serious.
DOCTOR: Okay, I’m just checking for tenderness and swelling. There's mild tenderness along the joint line on both knees. I hear a slight crepitus – that’s the clicking sound you mentioned – when you bend them, which is common with some types of joint issues. No significant swelling. Okay, Lilliana, thank you. That was helpful. Based on what you've told me and the exam, it sounds like you are experiencing symptoms consistent with osteoarthritis. This is a common condition, especially as we get older, and involves the breakdown of cartilage in the joints. It often presents with stiffness, especially in the mornings, and can be worsened by cold weather and inactivity.
PATIENT: Oh… osteoarthritis? That sounds… serious. Is it… bad? Will I be needing… surgery? I don’t like the sound of surgery. I just want to be able to do things without everything hurting. Is there anything I can do about it? I don’t want it to get worse. I'm a bit worried now, to be honest.
DOCTOR: It's understandable to be worried, Lilliana. Osteoarthritis is common, and while it’s a chronic condition, it doesn’t necessarily mean you’ll need surgery. In many cases, we can manage the symptoms effectively with non-surgical treatments. Surgery is usually considered as a last resort when other methods aren’t providing enough relief. We can start with some lifestyle modifications, like regular, gentle exercise to keep your joints mobile, and maintaining a healthy weight to reduce stress on your knees and hands. We can also try over-the-counter pain relievers, like ibuprofen or naproxen, to help with the pain and inflammation. I’m going to write you a prescription for a mild anti-inflammatory, and I’d like you to consider physical therapy. A physical therapist can teach you exercises to strengthen the muscles around your joints and improve your range of motion. I can also refer you to a rheumatologist for further evaluation, just to rule out any other possible causes. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh… that sounds… a bit better, I think. Exercise… I don’t know if I can manage a lot of exercise. But gentle exercise… maybe. And pain relievers… I suppose I could try those. I don't like taking pills, but if it helps… And a physical therapist… yes, that sounds good. Someone to show me what to do. A rheumatologist… is that someone else I have to see? More appointments? I’m a bit overwhelmed now, to be honest. It’s all a bit much. Is it expensive? I’m not really insured, you see.
DOCTOR: I understand, Lilliana. It is a lot to take in, and it’s perfectly normal to feel overwhelmed. We’ll take things one step at a time, and we'll focus on what’s manageable for you. We'll start with the pain relievers and the physical therapy referral. A rheumatologist is a specialist in joint conditions. Seeing them is optional at this point. It’s just to be thorough and rule out other possibilities. If you're not comfortable with that right now, we can definitely hold off. Regarding the cost, I understand you’re not insured. I can write you a referral to a physical therapy clinic that offers a sliding fee scale based on income. And I can also provide you with information about local resources that may be able to assist with the cost of medication. Let’s focus on getting you started with the pain relievers and the physical therapy referral first. I'll also give you a handout with exercises you can do at home to start with. Does that sound like a reasonable plan?
PATIENT: Oh… yes, that sounds much better. A sliding fee scale… that would be very helpful. And exercises I can do at home… yes, that’s good. I can manage that. And just start with the pain relievers… yes. Okay. That sounds… manageable. A handout would be good. And thank you for explaining everything so clearly. You've been very patient with me. I was getting a bit flustered there. I think that’s everything for now, isn’t it? I need to get going soon, to meet my neighbor.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Lilliana. It's my job, and I'm happy to help. It's perfectly okay to feel overwhelmed, especially when dealing with health concerns. Here’s the handout with the exercises. They’re gentle, so start slowly and listen to your body. And here’s the referral for physical therapy. They’ll contact you to schedule an appointment. I'm writing a prescription for naproxen, 500mg twice a day with food. If you experience any stomach upset, please stop taking it and let me know. And remember, if your symptoms worsen or you develop any new symptoms, please contact me right away. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you again, Doctor Maskal. You’ve been very kind. I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything so clearly, and for being so patient with me. I’ll try my best to follow your instructions. And I’ll contact the physical therapy clinic tomorrow. I should probably be going now. Have a good day.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Lilliana. It was a pleasure meeting you. Remember, take things one step at a time, and don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. I’m confident we can manage this together. Have a good day as well, and enjoy your time with your neighbor. Take care.
