DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Kelder. I’m Dr. Paulino. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it's… it's been my stomach, mostly. I just don’t feel right. I get sick to my stomach a lot, and I don't get hungry like I used to. Even just a little bit of food fills me up, and… well, it's been going on for a while now. I can't rightly say how long, it just feels like a long time. My mind isn’t what it used to be, you see.
DOCTOR: I understand. “Not feeling right” and changes in appetite… those are certainly things we need to investigate. You mentioned nausea and feeling full quickly. Can you describe the nausea?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. It's not a sharp pain, not like… like a bad stomach ache. It's more of a queasy feeling, you know? Like… like something's off. It comes and goes, but it's been happening more often lately. And it doesn't always mean I throw up, just… unsettled. Sometimes it happens before I even eat anything, other times it’s after. Honestly, it’s hard to pinpoint. Is that… is that helpful? I'm sorry if I’m rambling.
DOCTOR: It is helpful, Ms. Kelder, though admittedly not precisely definitive. The lack of a consistent pattern is… noteworthy. So, queasiness, sometimes before eating, sometimes after. And it doesn't always result in vomiting. Do you experience any other symptoms with the nausea?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Sometimes I feel a little tired, just… worn out. But I’m 76, Doctor, so that could be anything, right? And… sometimes my appetite just isn’t there, even when I’m not feeling sick. It's hard to explain. Oh! And I’ve lost a little weight, I think. My clothes feel a bit looser, but I haven’t actually weighed myself. It's just… a feeling. Does that make sense? I used to have a good appetite, always did. Loved to cook for my husband, rest his soul.
DOCTOR: Fatigue, loss of appetite, and unintentional weight loss… those are things we need to take seriously, regardless of age. Weight loss is particularly concerning. You said "a little weight loss". Can you give me a rough estimate?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Rough estimate… that’s hard. It’s not like a sudden thing, you see. Just… over the last few months, maybe five or ten pounds? I really don't know for sure. I haven’t stepped on a scale in… well, a long time. I used to weigh myself every week, when I was younger. But now… it just doesn’t seem as important, I guess. Is that helpful? I wish I had a better answer for you.
DOCTOR: Five to ten pounds over several months… alright. Now, let’s move on to your past medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions – diabetes, heart problems, anything like that?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me see… my husband always handled the doctor things, you see. I went when I had to, but I never really paid much attention to the names of things. I had my gallbladder out years and years ago, that's about all I can remember for sure. And I have a little bit of arthritis in my hands, but that's just old age, I think. And... oh, I had cancer a while back, a different kind, they removed it, and I've been okay ever since. I think that was about ten years ago. Is that what you're asking about?
DOCTOR: Alright. Gallbladder removal, arthritis, and a history of cancer… ten years ago, you said?
PATIENT: Yes, about ten years ago. They said it was… I can't remember the name of it, some kind of skin cancer, I think. They removed it and I had follow-up appointments for a while, and then… well, I just assumed I was okay. Everything seemed fine. Until this started, of course. It wasn’t anything like this before. I just want to feel normal again.
DOCTOR: And what about medications?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… Just the usual things for an old lady, I suppose. Something for my blood pressure, a little pill, I think it’s pink. And something for the arthritis, when it really flares up. I’m not very good with names, Doctor, I'm afraid. And… oh, a vitamin D supplement. The doctor said I wasn't getting enough sunshine. That’s about all, I think. I don't take a lot of pills, I try not to.
DOCTOR: Alright. Blood pressure medication, arthritis medication as needed, and vitamin D. Now, let’s discuss your family history. Were any of your close relatives – parents, siblings, children – diagnosed with stomach problems, cancer, or any other significant illnesses?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That’s a hard one. My mother… she died when I was young, from pneumonia, I think. And my father… he had heart trouble, I believe. My brother, he was healthy as a horse, never sick a day in his life, until… well, until he passed away in an accident. I don't really know much about their illnesses, to be honest. We didn't talk much about those things back then. I have a daughter, thankfully, and she’s healthy as can be. I don’t remember anyone having stomach trouble, specifically, no. Just the usual old-age things, I suppose. Is that helpful? I’m sorry I can’t be more specific. My memory just isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Alright. Pneumonia, heart trouble… no history of stomach problems. Now, I’m going to need to do a quick physical exam. Can you step on the scale for me, please?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Yes, of course. I haven't weighed myself in ages, you know. I hope it doesn't lie. Just let me know when you want me to stand still.
DOCTOR: 48 kilograms. That's… 106 pounds. And your height is 170 centimeters, correct?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. 170 centimeters. Oh dear. 106 pounds? That's… that's less than I thought. I have lost weight, haven’t I? Is that bad, Doctor? Is it something serious?
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Kelder. Now, I’m going to listen to your abdomen with the stethoscope. Just breathe normally. Bowel sounds are… diminished. And there’s some tenderness in the epigastric region, but no guarding or rebound tenderness. I also want to check your reflexes. Reflexes are… normal. Overall, the physical exam is… unremarkable, but the diminished bowel sounds and tenderness are concerning given your symptoms and weight loss.
PATIENT: Oh dear. Diminished bowel sounds… that doesn’t sound good, does it? And tenderness… is that serious, Doctor? What does that mean? I'm a bit scared now. Is it the cancer, Doctor? Has it come back? Please tell me what’s going on.
DOCTOR: Ms. Kelder, please try to remain calm. It’s too early to say definitively whether it’s related to your previous cancer, or something else entirely. The diminished bowel sounds and tenderness suggest some kind of gastrointestinal issue, but it could be a number of things – gastritis, a possible ulcer, or even something more serious. Given your weight loss and ongoing symptoms, I need to order some blood work and an upper endoscopy to get a clearer picture of what’s going on. The endoscopy will involve a small camera being inserted into your esophagus and stomach to visualize the lining and take biopsies if necessary. It’s the most reliable way to diagnose the cause of your symptoms.
PATIENT: Oh… a camera? Going inside? That sounds… awful. Is it painful, Doctor? Will it hurt? And biopsies… what does that mean? Taking pieces of me…? I… I don't know if I can do that. I’m not a strong woman anymore, Doctor. Please, is there anything else we can do? I just want to feel better.
DOCTOR: Ms. Kelder, the endoscopy is a routine procedure. We’ll give you a sedative to make you comfortable, so you won’t feel any pain. The biopsies are necessary to determine the underlying cause of your symptoms. Without them, we're simply guessing. Look, I understand you're anxious, but delaying a diagnosis won’t make things better. It could potentially worsen the problem. I'll have my nurse explain the procedure in detail and answer any questions you have. For now, I'm going to order a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a stool test to rule out any infections. I will also give you a referral to a gastroenterologist, Dr. Ramirez, who is excellent. We need to get to the bottom of this, Ms. Kelder, and these tests are the first step.
PATIENT: Oh… alright. If you think it's necessary. A sedative… that sounds… good. Dr. Ramirez… I’ll… I’ll make an appointment. What about the stool test? What do I do with that? I don't think I’m very good at these things anymore, Doctor. And… will the tests tell me if it’s the cancer again? That’s what I’m most afraid of.
