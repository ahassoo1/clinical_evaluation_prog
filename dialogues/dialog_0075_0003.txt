DOCTOR: Bonjour, Mr. Baide. It’s a pleasure to meet you. I’m Dr. Panjoj. Now, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Ugh, well, don't bother with the "mister" business. Just Jerrel is fine. And honestly? It's this…shaking. It’s bothersome, really. My hands, see? They just…tremble. It’s been happening for a while now, I suppose. Not sure exactly how long. Old age, probably. What do you want to know? Let’s just get this over with.
DOCTOR: Jerrel, certainly. And we will. It's good you're here. “A while now” is a bit vague, though, for medical purposes. Can you recall roughly when you first noticed the shaking?
PATIENT: Roughly? Honestly, woman, I don’t keep track of these things. Maybe…six months ago? Eight? It all blurs together after a while, you know? I was trying to enjoy my coffee, and I spilled it all over the newspaper. That’s when I really noticed it, I guess. Before that, maybe it was just a little bit. I don’t know! Is this important?
DOCTOR: Yes, it is. It helps us narrow things down. And please, don’t worry, I’m not trying to be difficult. Just gathering information. So, the shaking started roughly six to eight months ago, and you first noticed it while holding your coffee cup?
PATIENT: Holding my coffee! Yes, that's right. A perfectly good cup of espresso, wasted. And it’s not just coffee, it's everything. Trying to tie my tie…impossible. Eating soup? Forget about it. It's embarrassing, really. I used to have such steady hands. Used to direct people, you know? Now look at me.
DOCTOR: I understand. So it’s affecting multiple activities now – tying your tie, eating… anything requiring fine motor skills?
PATIENT: Fine motor skills? Is that what you call it? Fancy. Yes, anything that requires a bit of…precision. Writing is a mess. Buttoning my shirt… a struggle. And it's getting worse, I think. Slower, and more…violent. It's not a pleasant sight, believe me.
DOCTOR: Alright. And is the shaking present all the time, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Comes and goes. Mostly when I'm trying to do something, like I said. When I’m sitting still, watching the television, it’s usually alright. But if I reach for something, or try to hold something steady… that’s when it starts. Though sometimes, even when I'm resting, I feel a little…fluttering. Not as bad, but it’s there.
DOCTOR: I see. So, it’s exacerbated by activity but can also be present at rest, though less pronounced. Now, have you noticed anything else accompanying the shaking?
PATIENT: Accompanying the shaking? Like what? I don’t know… I get tired, easily. But that comes with age, doesn’t it? My wife… she used to say I was always a bit of a grump. But no, nothing specifically with the shaking. Just…annoying. Very annoying.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you experienced any stiffness in your muscles, any changes in your balance, or any difficulty with speech?
PATIENT: Stiffness? Not really. My joints ache a bit, like an old house settling, but that’s nothing new. Balance… well, I’m not as spry as I used to be, but I haven't fallen or anything. Speech? What are you implying, woman? I’m perfectly clear! Maybe people just don't listen anymore.
DOCTOR: I apologize if my questions seem… direct. It's just important to rule things out. No implication intended, simply gathering information. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Medical history… Oh, jeez. Let me think. High blood pressure, I suppose. The doctor told me years ago. I take a little pill for it. And… arthritis in my knees, maybe? I forget what the other doctor said. Honestly, I see so many specialists these days, it all blurs together. And my wife handled most of the paperwork. She's… gone now.
DOCTOR: I understand. High blood pressure and arthritis. Do you happen to know the names of any of the medications you are currently taking?
PATIENT: Medications… Look, I have a bottle somewhere in the kitchen, but I haven’t bothered to look at the labels in ages. My wife kept track of all that. A small white pill for the blood pressure, I think. And something else for my knees. A capsule, maybe? I really don’t know. Can’t we just get on with this?
DOCTOR: Alright. We can proceed, but it would be helpful to confirm your medications. I’ll ask the nurse to quickly check your record for a list of current prescriptions. While we wait, let's talk about allergies. Do you have any known allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. Never had any allergies. I eat everything. I used to travel all over the world, you know? Ate all sorts of things. No reactions, nothing. Just a strong stomach, I suppose. Get the nurse to hurry up, will you? This is taking too long.
DOCTOR: Certainly. The nurse should be with us momentarily. Now, just a few more questions while we wait. Have you ever had any significant surgeries or hospitalizations?
PATIENT: Surgeries… Let me see. I had my appendix out when I was a boy. A long time ago. And… I had a knee replacement a few years back. The other knee, not the one that aches. Aside from that, nothing major. A few stitches here and there, but nothing to write home about. Honestly, I can't remember all the details. It was a while ago.
DOCTOR: Appendix removal and a knee replacement. And finally, Jerrel, can you tell me about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history? Oh, for heaven's sake. That’s a long story. My father lived to be eighty-five, I think. He was a stubborn old man, like me. My mother… she died young, from something or other. My brother, he had heart trouble. And my sister… well, she always was a bit sickly. Is this really necessary? I’m starting to feel quite tired.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Jerrel. It is a lot of information. But family history can sometimes give us clues. Okay. So, your father lived to 85, your mother died young, and your brother had heart trouble. That’s helpful. Now, I’d like to perform a brief physical examination, if you don’t mind. Just checking your reflexes, coordination, and a few other things. It will only take a few minutes. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Ugh, alright. Just get it over with. I suppose I don’t have much of a choice, do I? But be gentle, will you? My hands are sensitive enough as it is. And don't poke around too much. I don't like being prodded.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I’ll be as gentle as possible. First, I’m going to check your blood pressure and pulse. Blood pressure is 140/90. Pulse is 78 and regular. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are normal, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Now, let’s take a look at your hands. I notice a resting tremor in both hands, more pronounced on the right. Can you please touch your nose with your finger?
PATIENT: Like this? It's not easy, you know. It feels like I’m trying to control a runaway train. My hands just… won't cooperate. It's embarrassing. See? I'm missing the mark every time.
DOCTOR: Yes, I see. There's some difficulty with coordination and accuracy. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. Reflexes are 2+ and symmetrical bilaterally. Now, could you please walk a few steps for me?
PATIENT: Like this? Be careful, I don't want to fall. My balance isn't what it used to be. I used to be a very active man, you know? A lot of walking, a lot of directing… Now look at me. Is this getting us anywhere?
DOCTOR: Yes, it is. These observations are helpful. Jerrel, based on the information you’ve provided and the physical examination, the most likely possibility is essential tremor. It’s a neurological condition that causes involuntary shaking, often in the hands. It’s not life-threatening, but it can be bothersome. However, other conditions can also cause tremors, so we need to rule those out. To do that, I’d like to order a few blood tests to check your thyroid function, vitamin levels, and rule out any other underlying medical causes. I also recommend a neurological consultation with Dr. Dubois. He’s a specialist in movement disorders and can provide a more definitive diagnosis and discuss treatment options. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Ugh, more tests, more doctors… Fine. Whatever you think is necessary. Just get it over with. Dr. Dubois, you say? Is he a nice man? I don’t have the energy to deal with difficult people. And what kind of treatment options are we talking about? Pills? Injections? I don't want anything complicated. Just tell me what I need to do, and I’ll do it. I just want this shaking to stop.
DOCTOR: Dr. Dubois is very well-regarded and known for being compassionate and thorough. As for treatment options, they can range from medication to help control the tremor – usually oral medications – to, in some cases, physical or occupational therapy. There are also more advanced options, like deep brain stimulation, but that's typically reserved for more severe cases. We’ll start with the basics – blood tests and a consultation with Dr. Dubois – and go from there. I’m going to order the blood tests now. The nurse will come in shortly to draw the samples. And I’ll have my assistant schedule an appointment for you with Dr. Dubois. In the meantime, try to avoid caffeine and stress, as those can worsen the tremor. And please, don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Caffeine? I drink espresso! And stress? That's my natural state! Look, just get the tests done, schedule the appointment, and let me get out of here. I've wasted enough time already. No, I don't have any questions. Just… get it over with. And tell the nurse to be gentle with the needle. I hate needles.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I’ll make a note about the needle. Alright, the tests are ordered, and I’m scheduling the appointment with Dr. Dubois now. The nurse will be in shortly. Thank you for your patience, Jerrel. And please, remember that we’re here to help. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No. Nothing else. Just… let me go. .
DOCTOR: Very well. Have a good day, Jerrel, and we’ll be in touch soon. Please don't hesitate to call if you have any questions.
