DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Ruocco. Welcome. I'm Dr. Galena. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Hmm… well, it’s this pain. When I take a deep breath, it hurts. It’s… hard to explain. It just does. Been happening for a bit now, I think. Not sure exactly how long, to be honest. My memory… it’s not what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Right, pain with deep breaths. Okay. It’s perfectly alright if the timing isn't precise, Mr. Ruocco. We’ll figure it out. Can you tell me where exactly you feel the pain?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It’s… in my chest, I guess. Sort of… all over? Not a sharp pain, more like a dull ache. It feels worse when I really try to fill my lungs up, like when I’m lifting something heavy. Though, I don't lift much these days. Old bones, you know.
DOCTOR: I understand. Dull ache in the chest, worse with deep breaths…and not a sharp pain. That’s helpful. Now, does this pain radiate anywhere – does it move down your arm, or up to your neck, perhaps?
PATIENT: Radiate? You mean… does it go anywhere else? I don't think so. Not that I've noticed, anyway. Maybe a little bit in my shoulder… on this side. But it’s hard to tell if that's the pain, or just… old age. Everything aches these days.
DOCTOR: Okay, so potentially some discomfort in the right shoulder as well. And you said it's been happening for “a bit now.” Has anything changed about it recently?
PATIENT: Changed? Well… it seems a little worse today, maybe? I was trying to help my grandson with some yard work, bending and stooping… and it really flared up after that. But before that… it was just a nagging thing. I mostly ignored it. Truth is, I get so many aches and pains, it’s hard to keep track.
DOCTOR: I appreciate your honesty, Mr. Ruocco. It sounds like the activity with your grandson may have aggravated it. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms along with the pain?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Let me see… I get a little short of breath sometimes, but I always have. Old lungs, you know. And… I’ve been coughing a bit more lately, maybe? But I always cough in the winter. It’s probably just a cold. I don’t really remember anything new. Honestly, Doctor, I just want to get this chest pain sorted out if we can. It worries me.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Ruocco. We'll do our best. Short of breath and a cough... we'll take those into account. Now, just to be thorough, have you had a fever, chills, or any swelling in your legs or feet?
PATIENT: Fever? No, I don’t think so. No chills either. My wife used to take my temperature when I had a cold, but she’s… gone now. Swelling… hmm. I think my feet might be a little puffy sometimes, but I figured that was just from standing too long. I don’t pay much attention to those things, to be honest. It’s hard to keep track of everything. Honestly, Doctor, I’m just an old man with a lot of aches and pains.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Ruocco. It sounds like you've been dealing with a lot. Alright, to get a better picture of things, could you tell me a little about your medical history?
PATIENT: Medical history… Oh dear. That’s… a long time ago. I’ve been to doctors, of course, but I don’t remember what they told me. Something about my heart, maybe? Years ago. And I had a bad fall a few years back, broke my wrist. But that healed. Honestly, Doctor, I’m not very good with remembering things like that. I didn’t keep good records. I should have, I know, but… I don’t know what to tell you.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Ruocco, that’s alright. We can work with that. Let me see… according to the system, it seems you were seen at the local clinic about five years ago for a wrist fracture, as you mentioned. There's also a note of a previous diagnosis of hypertension, high blood pressure, but the details are limited. Do you happen to recall taking any medications for that?
PATIENT: Hypertension… high blood pressure… That rings a bell… vaguely. I think… I think I took some pills for it, years ago. A little white one? But I stopped taking them. They made me feel dizzy, and my wife handled all the medicine stuff. She’s… not around anymore to remind me. I don’t know what the name of the pill was, or even if I still need it. I just stopped taking anything I didn’t think I needed. It’s all so confusing.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Ruocco. It sounds like you may have been on medication for high blood pressure in the past, but stopped due to side effects. That's good to know. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Not that I know of. Never had a bad reaction to anything, as far as I remember. My wife always asked me that question at the doctor, and I always said no. But… honestly, Doctor, I don’t think I’ve ever had a real bad allergy. Maybe a little sniffle with the pollen in the spring, but nothing serious. Is that important? I just want to figure out this chest pain. It’s worrying me.
DOCTOR: It is important, Mr. Ruocco, but it's good to know you haven't experienced any significant allergic reactions. Alright. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. Just listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and have a look at your chest. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Oh… alright. Yes, yes, that’s fine. Do what you need to do, Doctor. I just want to get this sorted out. The sooner the better, to be honest. I don’t want to be a bother. Just let me know if anything… if anything is wrong.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Ruocco. It won’t take long. Now, if you could just take a few deep breaths for me… Okay… I'm listening to your lungs now. I hear some diminished breath sounds on the lower right side… and a few scattered crackles. Heart sounds are regular, but slightly faint. Blood pressure is elevated at 160/95. There’s some tenderness to palpation on the right side of your chest. No obvious masses or abnormalities. Alright, Mr. Ruocco. I’ve finished the exam. Based on what you’ve told me and what I’ve heard, there are a few things we should investigate further. Your blood pressure is quite high, and the diminished breath sounds and crackles could indicate some congestion in your lungs. And the tenderness on your chest wall could be related to your pain. Would you be willing to get a chest X-ray and an EKG?
PATIENT: X-ray and… EKG? Oh dear. Is something really wrong, Doctor? I don’t like hospitals or… tests. Are they painful? I just wanted someone to tell me what was causing the pain, not… not do a lot of things to me. What will those tests show? Is it serious? Honestly, Doctor, I’m just an old man. I don't want any trouble.
