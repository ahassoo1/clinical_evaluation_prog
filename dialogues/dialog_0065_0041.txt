DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Asthore. I'm Dr. Duplichan. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. Well, it’s… it’s been getting harder to do things, you see. My legs, mostly. Just… weaker. It’s been happening slowly, over time. I think it’s the… the thing the other doctors told me I have. Multiple… something? It’s a long name.
DOCTOR: Multiple sclerosis, perhaps?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that’s it! Multiple sclerosis. That’s what they said. It just… makes me tired, and my legs don’t work like they used to. It’s hard to explain. It’s not pain, not really. Just… gone. Like they don’t want to move.
DOCTOR: “Gone,” you say. And how long has this “going” been happening?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question, Doctor. It’s hard to say exactly. Maybe… six months now? It started small, just a little stumble here and there. I thought it was just getting old, you know? But it’s gotten worse. It’s harder to walk without my cane now, and sometimes I feel… wobbly. Like I might fall. Especially at the end of the day.
DOCTOR: Six months. And you've noticed it's progressively worsening, with increasing difficulty walking and a sensation of instability, particularly at the end of the day. Have you experienced any other symptoms alongside the leg weakness and instability?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Thinking about it… yes. My hands get tired too, sometimes. It’s hard to hold things, like a cup of tea. And… I don’t see as well as I used to. Everything seems… blurry sometimes. And I get very tired, even when I sleep. More tired than just old tired, you know? It’s a heavy tiredness. Is that… part of it too?
DOCTOR: Fatigue, visual changes, and hand weakness… those can be associated with multiple sclerosis, yes. However, those symptoms are quite general. Let’s try to be more specific. Regarding your vision, is it blurry in one eye or both?
PATIENT: Both eyes, Doctor. Not all the time, but often. It’s like looking through a foggy window. And sometimes… it feels like my eyes are shaking, just a little bit. Not a big shake, but… a wobble, like my legs. It’s hard to describe. I haven’t told my wife about the shaking, though. I didn’t want to worry her. Is that… bad?
DOCTOR: The blurry vision and shaking… that’s concerning, Mr. Asthore. It's good you're reporting these details, even if you haven't mentioned them before. It’s never bad to share what you’re experiencing, regardless of how small it seems. Now, have you had any changes in your bladder or bowel function?
PATIENT: Bladder and… bowel? Oh. Hmm. Let me think. No, Doctor. Nothing different there. I go to the bathroom like always. No trouble holding things, or… anything like that. Just… the usual. I’m sorry, is that a silly answer? I don’t understand why you’re asking.
DOCTOR: No, it's not a silly answer. It's important to rule out all possibilities. Bladder and bowel changes can occur with multiple sclerosis, but it's good to know you haven't experienced them. Now, let's talk about your past medical history. Have you ever been hospitalized for anything other than minor illnesses?
PATIENT: Hospitalized? Hmm… let me see. When I was a young man, I broke my arm playing football. That was a long time ago. And… my wife says I had a high fever when I was a little boy, but I don’t remember that. Other than that… no. Nothing serious. I’ve always been a strong man. I worked hard my whole life, Doctor. Farming, then building houses. Never much sick.
DOCTOR: Broken arm as a child, significant childhood fever...and otherwise healthy. Do you have any family history of neurological conditions, like multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, or ALS?
PATIENT: That’s a hard question, Doctor. My family… we didn’t talk much about sickness. We were too busy trying to survive. My mother… she walked with a cane when she got old, but I don’t know why. And my uncle… he was a little shaky in his hands when he got old too. But nobody ever said what was wrong with him. Is that… helpful? I wish I knew more. It’s been a long time.
DOCTOR: It's helpful to know what you do know, Mr. Asthore. Vague family history of gait issues… acceptable. Now, let’s move on to medications. Are you currently taking any prescription medications, over-the-counter drugs, or supplements?
PATIENT: Just my heart medicine, Doctor. A little pill every morning. And sometimes, when my knees are bad, I take some ibuprofen. Just when they really bother me, you know? Nothing else. I try to stay away from too many pills. My wife keeps track of everything, though. She's very good at that. I don't remember the name of the heart medicine, I’m sorry. Is that okay?
DOCTOR: Heart medication and ibuprofen as needed. We’ll verify the medication list with your wife. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or environmental factors?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not that I know of. I’ve eaten everything, traveled everywhere. I don’t have a sensitive stomach or anything like that. My wife always tells me to be careful, but I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything. I think I’m pretty lucky. I haven't even had the flu in years!
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Asthore. Now, I'd like to perform a brief physical and neurological examination. This will help me assess your strength, reflexes, balance, and coordination. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That’s fine. Whatever you think is best. I trust you. I want to know what’s happening, you know? I just… want to feel better. I'm ready when you are. Just let me know what I need to do.
DOCTOR: Excellent. First, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please remove your shirt and lie down on the table. We’ll start there. Heart sounds are normal. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Strength is 5/5 in upper extremities. Lower extremities demonstrate 4+/5 strength bilaterally, with mild weakness noted in dorsiflexion. Reflexes are 2+ and symmetric bilaterally. Mild dysmetria present with heel-to-shin testing on the left. Demonstrates a wide-based, unsteady gait with a positive Romberg test. Alright, Mr. Asthore. Based on the examination findings—the mild weakness in your legs, the dysmetria, the unsteady gait, and the positive Romberg test—your symptoms are consistent with a possible exacerbation of multiple sclerosis. However, further testing is needed to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other potential causes. I’d like to order an MRI of your brain and spinal cord. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: An MRI, Doctor? Is that… serious? Will it tell me what’s happening? I've never had one before. And… will it hurt? I just… I want to know what’s going on. And I don’t want to be in pain. Is it expensive? I have Medicare, but… my wife worries about money.
DOCTOR: An MRI is a very useful imaging test, Mr. Asthore. It uses magnetic fields and radio waves to create detailed pictures of your brain and spinal cord. It's not painful—you'll lie inside a large tube, and it can be a little noisy, but it shouldn't hurt. We can provide you with earplugs. It will help us determine if there are lesions in your brain or spinal cord consistent with multiple sclerosis. It won’t definitively tell us everything, but it's a crucial step in understanding your condition. Medicare should cover a significant portion of the cost, but there may be a co-pay or deductible. We have staff who are experienced in assisting patients with billing and insurance questions, and they can help you understand your financial responsibility. We will look into that for you. In the meantime, I'm going to order some blood work to rule out other possible causes for your symptoms, such as vitamin deficiencies or thyroid issues. I also recommend a referral to a neurologist for specialized evaluation and management. Would you be agreeable to those steps?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… good. Blood work, the MRI, and seeing the… neurologist. Whatever you think is best. I trust you. Just… please help me understand everything. And thank you for explaining it so clearly. My wife will be very relieved to hear you’re helping me. She worries so much. Can we schedule the MRI soon? I want to get this over with.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I will have my assistant schedule the MRI for you as soon as possible. We’ll aim for the earliest available appointment. We will also schedule the blood work and the neurology referral. I’ll also provide you with a written summary of our discussion today, including information about the tests and referral. It's important to share this information with your wife. Mr. Asthore, while we await the results of the tests, I recommend continuing to use your cane for support and avoiding activities that exacerbate your symptoms. If you experience any new or worsening symptoms—such as difficulty breathing, vision loss, or severe weakness—please contact the office immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think… I think that’s everything. Thank you so much for listening and for explaining everything so clearly. You’ve put my mind a little at ease. And please… thank your assistant for me. I’m sure she’s very busy. I’ll just… wait for the tests now. And I’ll be careful. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Asthore. I’m glad I could help. We'll be in touch as soon as we have the results. Please don't hesitate to contact the office if you have any concerns. And please, tell your wife we appreciate her support as well. Have a good day, Mr. Asthore.
