DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Aluia. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Neppl. It's a pleasure to meet you. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. Well, it’s these bumps on my legs, see? Right here on my shins. They’re red and kinda painful. Been bothering me for a little while now, maybe a month or so. Not sure what they are, that’s why I came.
DOCTOR: Thank you for coming in, Mr. Aluia. A month of red, painful bumps on your shins… that certainly warrants a closer look. To get a better understanding, could you describe the pain a little more specifically?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think. It’s not like a sharp pain, more of a…achey feeling, you know? Especially when I walk a lot. I work, uh, moving things around at the warehouse, so I’m on my feet all day. It feels worse after a long day at work, definitely. And sometimes they feel a little…warm to the touch. Is that important?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's quite helpful, Mr. Aluia. An achy pain exacerbated by activity, and warmth to the touch… those are important details. Now, have you noticed any changes in the bumps themselves?
PATIENT: Changes? Like…getting bigger? Yeah, some of them have gotten a little bigger. And, oh! One or two have kinda…oozed a little bit. Just a tiny bit, nothing much. I put a band-aid on it, just in case. I'm not sure if it's getting infected or something. I don’t remember hurting my legs or anything.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that. Growth in size and some mild oozing are things we’ll need to assess. And the fact that you haven’t experienced any trauma to the legs is also useful information. Now, to get a more complete picture, could you tell me a little about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Past medical history… well, I’m 71, so a little bit here and there! Let’s see… I have high blood pressure, the doctor told me years ago. I take medicine for it, every day. And my wife, she says I snore real loud, but that’s not really a medical thing, is it? Nothing major, really. I got Medicare, if that helps. And I’ve never been allergic to anything that I know of.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful to know, Mr. Aluia. High blood pressure, managed with medication, and no known allergies. We'll certainly take that into account. And yes, Medicare is helpful information. Now, I’d like to take a look at your legs. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course! Go right ahead. I was expecting you to look at them. They're probably not pretty, but there they are. Feel free to poke and prod, Doctor. I trust your judgment.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Aluia. I see several raised, erythematous nodules on both shins. They are tender to the touch, and there’s some mild warmth. No signs of significant drainage or systemic inflammation at this time. The surrounding skin appears relatively normal. Based on my initial assessment, these appear consistent with what we call stasis dermatitis, often associated with venous insufficiency. Do you have a history of varicose veins, or swelling in your legs?
PATIENT: Varicose veins… hmm. My wife says I do, but I don’t really pay attention to those things. And sometimes, yeah, my legs get kinda swollen at the end of the day, especially if it’s real hot outside. I thought it was just because I was old! But swelling, yeah, that happens. Is that bad? Should I have said something sooner?
DOCTOR: No, you shouldn’t feel bad about not mentioning it sooner, Mr. Aluia. It’s often something people dismiss as a normal part of aging, as you said. Swelling and a history of varicose veins certainly support the possibility of stasis dermatitis. To confirm this, and rule out other potential causes, I’d like to order a duplex ultrasound of your legs to assess the blood flow in your veins. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: An ultrasound, huh? Sounds fancy. Okay, yes, that’s fine. If you think it's best, Doctor, I trust you. I just want to get these bumps taken care of, if I can. They’re just a nuisance, but they’re starting to bother me a little more each day. Where do we do that? At the hospital or something?
DOCTOR: Yes, the ultrasound will be performed at the hospital, but you won’t need to be admitted. It’s a non-invasive test, meaning it doesn't require any needles or incisions. A technician will simply use a gel and a handheld device to create images of the blood vessels in your legs. I'll write you a referral order, and the hospital will contact you to schedule an appointment. While we wait for the results, I’m going to recommend some conservative measures to help alleviate your symptoms. Specifically, I’d like you to elevate your legs whenever possible, especially at the end of the day, and wear compression stockings. They help improve blood flow and reduce swelling. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: Compression stockings… like those tight ones? My wife has some, she says they help with her legs too. Okay, I can try those. Elevate my legs… I can do that while I’m watching TV, I guess. So, no special cream or anything? Just stockings and putting my feet up? And how long until I hear back about the ultrasound?
DOCTOR: That's right. Compression stockings and elevation are the first line of treatment for stasis dermatitis. We can discuss topical steroids or other medications if your symptoms don’t improve with these measures. As for the ultrasound, the hospital typically schedules appointments within a week, and the results should be sent to me within 24-48 hours of the test. Once I have the results, I’ll contact you to discuss the findings and create a comprehensive treatment plan. In the meantime, if you notice any signs of infection – such as increased redness, swelling, pain, or pus – please contact me immediately. Do you have any other questions for me at this time, Mr. Aluia?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very helpful. It's good to know what's going on, even if it’s just putting my feet up and wearing some tight socks! I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything so clearly.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Aluia. I'm glad I could provide some clarity. Remember, we're here to help. I’ll have my assistant schedule you for the ultrasound and provide you with a written summary of today's discussion and instructions. Please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any concerns before your ultrasound appointment. Have a good day, Mr. Aluia, and I look forward to seeing you again soon.
