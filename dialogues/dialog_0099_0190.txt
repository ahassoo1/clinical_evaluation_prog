DOCTOR: Right. Lilyanna Snerling, yes?
PATIENT: Yes, that is correct. It’s… nice to meet you, Doctor Overgaard. Though, truthfully, I don't recall making an appointment. Everything feels a bit… hazy lately.
DOCTOR: Hazy, you say?
PATIENT: Yes. It's difficult to explain. It's not like a complete blank, more… like looking at something through fog. I know I’m a rotary drill operator, and I… I believe my husband passed away some time ago, but the details… they slip away. And now this unsteadiness. It’s rather concerning.
DOCTOR: Rotary drill operator… right. And this unsteadiness – when did that begin?
PATIENT: That's a good question. Honestly, it's hard to pinpoint. It feels like it's been gradually worsening over the past few weeks, perhaps a month? At first, it was just a little clumsiness, stumbling occasionally. Now, it’s… well, it feels like I could fall over at any moment. It’s quite frightening when I’m working, you can imagine.
DOCTOR: Right. And you said this is… recent?
PATIENT: Yes, recent. As far as I can tell. It’s just… I don’t have a good sense of time, Doctor. Things feel… disjointed. I apologize for being so vague; I wish I could be more helpful. I just… don't remember things like I used to.
DOCTOR: Disjointed… and this is impacting your work?
PATIENT: Yes, very much so. It’s a dangerous job, operating the drill, and needing to be steady is… essential. I’ve been trying to compensate, to be extra careful, but it’s only a matter of time before something goes wrong, I fear. It’s not just the work, though. Walking, even just standing… it all feels precarious.
DOCTOR: And have you experienced any other changes?
PATIENT: Other changes… hmm. That’s a difficult question. Let me think. My appetite hasn’t been very good lately, though I assumed that was just the stress of… everything. And I’ve been sleeping… a lot. More than usual, certainly. But it's hard to say if those are connected or just… life. It’s all rather muddled, Doctor. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: Mm-hm. Let's move on to your medical history. Have you had any serious illnesses in the past?
PATIENT: Serious illnesses… I had a bout of pneumonia when I was quite young, I believe. And… I had surgery on my appendix, many years ago. But beyond that… I honestly can't recall. I've always been relatively healthy, as far as I know. My husband used to take care of most of the doctor's appointments and paperwork. I'm so sorry; I wish I could give you more details.
DOCTOR: Family history, then. Are your parents still alive?
PATIENT: No, they… they passed away some time ago. My mother, when I was still a child, from a fever. And my father… I believe he had heart trouble. It was… quite sudden. He worked very hard his entire life, and… well, I suppose it took its toll. I don’t recall much detail about his illness, truthfully. It was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: And what about medications?
PATIENT: Medications… I take something for my blood pressure, I believe. A small white pill, once a day. And… sometimes something for headaches, but only when they’re particularly bad. It’s an over-the-counter pain reliever, I think. Honestly, Doctor, I don’t manage my own medications very well. I rely on… well, I used to rely on my husband for that. It's all a bit disorganized now.
DOCTOR: Allergies?
PATIENT: Allergies… I don't think I have any. I've never had a reaction to anything, as far as I remember. No trouble with food, or medications, or… anything. But again, I apologize for being so vague. My memory is simply not what it used to be. Is that concerning, Doctor? Should I be more concerned?
DOCTOR: Alright. We’ll need to do a quick physical examination. Just a basic neurological assessment and check your vital signs. It’s standard procedure given your symptoms. Please follow my instructions as closely as you can, even if it feels… difficult.
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I'll do my best to follow your instructions. It's just… sometimes it feels as if my body doesn’t quite listen to me anymore. But I’ll try. Lead the way.
DOCTOR: Alright. First, let's check your reflexes. Please sit here and relax. Right. And now, can you close your eyes and touch your nose with your index finger?
PATIENT: Yes, I can. Oh… that wasn't very accurate, was it? It feels… strange. As if my hand isn’t quite under my control. Is that normal, Doctor?
DOCTOR: No, it's not ideal. Now, let's check your balance. Please stand up and try to stand still for thirty seconds, with your arms at your sides. No leaning against anything. Okay, stop. That's enough. Right. And finally, let’s listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath…
PATIENT: Oh dear… I… I don't think I can. I'm going to fall. It's happening again. I feel… dizzy. Please, can I sit down?
DOCTOR: Alright, just sit and breathe deeply. It's alright. Your blood pressure is slightly elevated, pulse is normal. Now, I need to ask you some more detailed questions. This is going to be a bit lengthy, but it's important. Can you tell me, has there been any head trauma recently?
PATIENT: Head trauma… no, I don’t think so. Nothing that I recall, anyway. I mean, I haven’t fallen or… hit my head. Not recently. Although… I do have… flashes of… something. Vague images, but they aren’t clear. It's like looking at a broken photograph. I can't quite piece it together. It's frustrating. Does that count?
DOCTOR: "Flashes"...and can you describe these flashes?
PATIENT: It’s difficult to explain, Doctor. They aren't like… memories. More like… sensations. A feeling of falling, perhaps. Or… a bright light. Sometimes there’s a ringing in my ears. But they’re fleeting, gone as quickly as they appear. And they’re not always the same. It's all very disjointed, like… fragments of something I can’t quite grasp. Honestly, it’s making me quite anxious. It feels like something is… missing. Like a piece of me is lost.
DOCTOR: And these “fragments”… when did they start?
PATIENT: That’s a difficult question. It feels… gradual. At first, it was just a feeling of… disorientation. Like being slightly out of focus. Then, the flashes started. Perhaps… a few weeks ago? Around the same time as the unsteadiness, I think. But everything is so muddled, it’s hard to say for certain. I wish I could give you a more definitive answer, Doctor. I truly do. It's just… my memory is simply not what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Alright. Given your symptoms – the unsteadiness, the memory loss, the flashes – and the neurological assessment findings, I'm concerned about several possibilities. It could be a number of things, from a simple inner ear issue to something more serious. To rule out some of the more concerning possibilities, I need to order some tests. We'll need a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, a CT scan of your brain, and an MRI. We will also need a referral to a neurologist.
PATIENT: A CT scan… and an MRI? A neurologist? Those sound… serious, Doctor. Is it something very bad? Is there anything… less concerning it could be? I’m… rather frightened. What if… what if it's something I can't recover from?
DOCTOR: It's important to remain calm. These tests are simply to rule out potential causes. It doesn’t mean you have anything serious. The MRI and CT scan will help us visualize your brain and identify any structural abnormalities. The neurologist is a specialist in the brain and nervous system, and can provide a more detailed evaluation. It could be something less concerning – perhaps a vitamin deficiency, or a medication side effect. But given the nature of your symptoms, it’s crucial to investigate further. I understand your anxiety, and I’ll be with you every step of the way. We’ll get to the bottom of this. Now, I'm going to write you a referral to Dr. Anya Sharma, a neurologist at the City Hospital. Do you have any transportation arrangements to get there?
PATIENT: Dr. Sharma… City Hospital. No, I don't… My husband used to drive me everywhere. I… haven't driven in years. And I don’t have anyone to take me. I live alone now, you see. It’s… rather difficult. I hadn’t thought about getting there. I suppose I could… try to take a taxi? But I’m not sure if that’s safe… especially given my unsteadiness.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’ll have my office staff contact the hospital's patient transport service. They can arrange for a medical transport. It’s a non-emergency service, but they'll provide a driver and assistance. This document contains the referral information, the hospital address, and the phone number for the transport service. I’m also going to prescribe a low-dose anti-anxiety medication to help manage your anxiety while we wait for the test results. It’s not a cure, but it may help calm your nerves. I also strongly advise you to avoid driving, operating heavy machinery, or making any important decisions until we have a clearer diagnosis. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Medical transport… anti-anxiety medication… Will the medication make me… drowsy? I… I don't want to be incapacitated. And… what if the tests reveal something… terrible? I’m… terribly frightened, Doctor. I feel so… lost and alone. Is there anyone I can contact? Family? Friends? I… I can't remember. This is all so overwhelming.
DOCTOR: The anti-anxiety medication can cause some drowsiness, but it’s usually mild. We’ll start with a low dose and see how you tolerate it. If it affects you too much, we can adjust the dosage or switch to a different medication. As for the test results, it’s important to remember that we don’t know anything yet. Worrying about “what ifs” won’t help. We’ll take things one step at a time. We’ll review the results together and discuss all of your options. Regarding family or friends… you mentioned your husband passed away. Do you recall any other close relatives or friends?
PATIENT: No… no, I don’t. It's all… a blur. I remember… a feeling of loss, of emptiness. But no names, no faces. No one. I was… rather isolated in my later years. My husband was my whole world. I… I truly am alone, Doctor. This is… terrifying. What if something happens to me and no one knows? I don't… I don't know what to do.
DOCTOR: It’s alright to cry. It’s understandable. Given your situation, I'm going to contact a social worker. They can help you navigate this difficult time, assess your support network, and provide resources and assistance. They can also explore options for long-term care if needed. They're very good at helping people feel less alone. In the meantime, please focus on getting through each day, one step at a time. Take the anti-anxiety medication as prescribed, and avoid any activities that might put you at risk. And remember, you're not alone. We're here to help. I’ll also make a note in your file to ensure you receive extra support from my staff. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: A social worker… Would they… would they be able to help me remember things? To… piece together my life? That's… that's all I really want. To know who I am, who I was. And… thank you, Doctor. For… for everything. For not dismissing me. For… trying to help. I think… I think that's all I can ask for right now. .
DOCTOR: The social worker can connect you with resources that may help with memory recovery. It’s unlikely to be a quick fix, but they can explore options like therapy, support groups, and potentially even neurological rehabilitation. You’re very welcome, Lilyanna. My job is to help, and I’m glad I can provide some support. Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns or questions. My staff will contact you to schedule a follow-up appointment and arrange a meeting with the social worker. Take care of yourself. .
