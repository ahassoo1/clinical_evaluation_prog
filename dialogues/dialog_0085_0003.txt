DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Baide. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Lahn. It’s nice to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Ugh, morning. Look, I don’t have all day, you know. My hand’s been shaking. Been happening for… well, a while now. Honestly, it's just annoying. Mostly. Don't really know why I'm even here, my daughter insisted. She worries too much.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Baide. It’s good of your daughter to look out for you, and it’s certainly valid to want to get this checked out, even if it is mostly annoying. "A while now" is a bit vague – could you tell me roughly how long you've been noticing the shaking?
PATIENT: Roughly? Honestly, I couldn't tell ya. Months, maybe? Years? Time all blurs together after a certain point, you know? It comes and goes. Sometimes it’s barely noticeable, other times… well, I drop things. Mostly coffee. A real nuisance, that is.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's common for things to feel less distinct over time. So, it's been happening intermittently for months, possibly years, and it's noticeable enough to cause you to drop things, particularly coffee. Does the shaking happen more when you're doing something specific, like reaching for something, or is it more random?
PATIENT: Reaching, mostly. Or when I try to write, which I hardly do anymore, thank goodness. Used to be a big scribbler, you know? Scripts and all that. Now, it's just a mess. It's… irritating. Look, is this going to take long? I have a lunch reservation.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it's more prominent when you're reaching or attempting to write. And it's causing difficulty with those actions. I appreciate you letting me know about your lunch reservation, I'll do my best to be efficient. Before we proceed, could you tell me a little bit about any other symptoms you might be experiencing?
PATIENT: Symptoms? What kind of symptoms? Look, I just have a shaky hand. That's it. I’m not about to start listing every ache and pain a man my age has. It's called getting old, you know? Besides, I don't even feel sick. Just… unsteady. Is this about my memory? My daughter keeps saying… never mind.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Baide. You’re right, aches and pains come with age. I wasn't expecting a full list, just checking to see if there's anything else accompanying the shaking – things like stiffness, numbness, weakness, or any changes in your coordination. And no, this isn’t specifically about your memory, though we can certainly address any concerns you or your daughter have later if you'd like. Let’s focus on the hand for now. Have you noticed the shaking in any other parts of your body – legs, head, or even your voice?
PATIENT: No. Just the hand. Sometimes a little bit in the arm, maybe, but mostly the hand. And it’s… wobbly. That’s the best way to describe it. Not a violent shake, just… wobbly. Look, are you going to poke and prod me? I don’t like being poked and prodded.
DOCTOR: Okay, just the hand, sometimes extending to the arm, and you describe it as “wobbly” rather than a strong shaking. I promise to be as gentle as possible, Mr. Baide. I do need to do a quick physical exam of your hands and arms to get a better sense of what’s going on – check your reflexes, muscle tone, and coordination. It shouldn’t be uncomfortable. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Fine, fine. But make it quick. And don’t expect me to cooperate if it gets unpleasant. Honestly, I was a director, you know? I give the orders around here. Just… get on with it. But gently. Very gently.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Baide. I understand. I'll be as quick and gentle as possible. First, I’m going to have you sit comfortably and relax your arms in your lap. Then I’ll just check your reflexes in both arms. Okay, and now can you touch your nose with your finger?
PATIENT: There. See? What did I tell you? Shaky. It's just… shaky. Is that all you needed to see? Can I go now? My lunch…
DOCTOR: I see. It does appear there's some tremor present, and some difficulty with coordination. It’s helpful to see this firsthand. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, just as a routine check. It shouldn’t take long. Everything sounds clear there, Mr. Baide. Based on what you've told me and what I've observed, it sounds like you might be experiencing what we call essential tremor. It’s a common neurological condition that causes shaking, often in the hands, and can worsen with age. However, there are other possibilities, and to rule those out, I’d like to order a few blood tests, and potentially a consultation with a neurologist. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Neurologist? Blood tests? Look, I just have a shaky hand! What's to rule out? I’m eighty years old! Things shake! Honestly, this is getting ridiculous. My daughter and her worrying… I don't want any tests. I just want to go to lunch. Is there… anything I can do right now to make it stop? A pill? Something?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Baide, and I apologize if this feels excessive. It’s true, tremor is common with age, but it’s important to rule out other, less common causes, like thyroid issues or medication side effects, which can be addressed. The blood tests are relatively simple and will help us get a clearer picture. As for a quick fix… unfortunately, there’s no single pill to completely stop essential tremor immediately. However, there are medications that can help manage the symptoms. Beta-blockers, for example, are sometimes used. But before we consider medication, I need to have a better understanding of your overall health, which is why I’m recommending the blood tests. Would you be willing to consider just the blood tests?
PATIENT: Fine. Blood tests. But that's it. No neurologists. No poking and prodding. Just the blood tests. And can you please hurry? I have a reservation, you know. And tell your nurse to be gentle with the needle. I bruise easily.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Baide. Just the blood tests, and I'll make a note for the nurse to be very gentle with the needle. I’ll also write the order for those now. Here’s the form. It just lists the tests we need to run. You'll take this to the lab just down the hall, and they’ll draw the blood. It shouldn’t take too long. Once the results are back, we can discuss them and decide on the best course of action. In the meantime, I can offer you a few general tips for managing the tremor. Try to avoid caffeine and stress, as those can worsen the shaking. And if it’s bothering you, you can try using weighted utensils or adaptive devices to help with everyday tasks. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: Weighted utensils? Seriously? Look, just… no. I’ll take the form. And I really need to go. Thanks. Or… whatever. Just… get me out of here. .
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Baide. Have a good lunch. And please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. The nurse will be happy to help if you need anything before you leave. .
