DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Vanderwiele. I am Dr. Blim. Now, let’s get straight to it. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, to be frank, it’s my breathing. It gets…difficult when I try to lie down flat. It’s been happening for a little while now, maybe a month or so. It’s rather inconvenient, if you understand.
DOCTOR: Inconvenient. Yes, well, many ailments are inconvenient. A month, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, a month, give or take. I keep track, you see. It started gradually, just a little harder to get comfortable. Now…well, now I need several pillows. It’s not a sharp pain, just…a pressure. A tightness, really. And it makes it hard to stay asleep, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Several pillows. And you've noticed this specifically when lying flat?
PATIENT: Yes, specifically flat. If I sit up, or even prop myself up a bit with a few pillows, it’s…better. Not perfect, mind you, but certainly not like when I’m lying completely flat. It feels like…something is pressing on my chest, perhaps? Though I can’t say for sure. I’m not a doctor, of course.
DOCTOR: "Reports dyspnea positional, worse supine." Alright. And are you experiencing any other symptoms along with this…tightness?
PATIENT: Dyspnea…you said? I don't quite understand all the…doctor talk. But, other symptoms… let me think. My ankles do swell a bit by the end of the day, if I’ve been on my feet. And I get tired rather easily, even after a good night’s rest. Although, as I said, getting a good night's rest is proving difficult. Is that what you mean by symptoms?
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Vanderwiele, that is precisely what I mean by symptoms. Ankle swelling and fatigue. Are you experiencing any coughing?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, no coughing. Not at all. Just…this breathing trouble and feeling worn out. And the ankles. It's not a sharp pain in my ankles, just… puffy, you understand? They don't hurt, just…uncomfortable in my shoes. I try to wear comfortable shoes, but still. It's a nuisance. Is there anything else you need to know? I have an appointment later this afternoon, you see.
DOCTOR: A nuisance. Right. Have you noticed any…shortness of breath when you're not lying down?
PATIENT: Not particularly, no. I can walk around the house fine. I can walk to the store, though I don’t go as often as I used to. It’s not like I’m gasping for air or anything. It's just…when I go to lie down, that's when it becomes difficult. It's a very specific problem, really. Do you think it could be…my mattress? It’s getting rather old.
DOCTOR: While your mattress could contribute, Ms. Vanderwiele, we must explore more likely causes. Let's move on. Do you have any history of heart problems?
PATIENT: Heart problems? No, not that I’m aware of. My father had high blood pressure, I believe, but I’ve never been told I have any trouble with my heart. I’ve had a regular check-up with Dr. Ramirez for years, and he’s never mentioned anything. I’ve always been fairly healthy, all things considered. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: No known heart history. Alright. Any diabetes?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No diabetes. Never been diagnosed. I do enjoy a sweet treat now and then, but nothing excessive, you understand. I try to be sensible. I really don’t have any major health issues, which is why this breathing trouble is so… perplexing. I’m not one to complain, but it's affecting my sleep. And I do need my sleep.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let's have a listen to your lungs, shall we?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I'll do whatever I need to do to get this sorted out. I do hope it isn’t anything serious.
DOCTOR: Take a deep breath…and exhale. Again. Hmm. Some mild wheezing bilaterally. And a slight…crackles at the bases. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart.
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. Whatever you need. My heart…I hope it’s nothing. It’s always beat regularly, as far as I know. My father always said I had a strong heart.
DOCTOR: Heart rate is regular, but…a slight S3 gallop present. Ms. Vanderwiele, based on what you’ve told me and my examination, I suspect you may be experiencing early congestive heart failure. Now, do not panic. We’ll need to run some tests to confirm this. An EKG and a chest X-ray are essential. And I'll order a BNP blood test.
PATIENT: Congestive…heart failure? Oh dear. That sounds…serious. Is that why my ankles are swelling? And why I'm so tired? And…this breathing trouble? I…I don't understand. What does this mean, Doctor? I thought I was just getting old. What kind of tests are these? Will they hurt?
DOCTOR: Ms. Vanderwiele, please. It may be early congestive heart failure. It’s not a death sentence, but it does require management. The swelling is likely fluid retention, a common symptom. The fatigue…well, that can be related as well. The tests are quite simple. The EKG is painless—we simply attach electrodes to your chest. The chest X-ray involves brief radiation exposure—minimal, I assure you. And the blood test is just a routine draw. I’ll have my nurse explain the procedure in detail. I'm referring you to Dr. Chen, a cardiologist, for a more thorough evaluation. He’s excellent. Please schedule an appointment as soon as possible. And for now, try to reduce your salt intake and elevate your legs when you’re resting. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes…yes, I understand. Reduce salt and…elevate my legs. And see Dr. Chen. Is…is this something I should be very worried about, Doctor? I just…I don’t want to be a burden to anyone. And I’d like to stay independent as long as possible. Could this…could this be something else? Perhaps just a bad cold, lingering on?
DOCTOR: Ms. Vanderwiele, while a cold is possible, your symptoms and my examination strongly suggest a cardiac issue. Delaying diagnosis could lead to complications. I understand your concerns about independence, but managing this potential condition is paramount. I am referring you to a specialist for a definitive diagnosis and treatment plan. For now, please focus on following my recommendations and scheduling that appointment with Dr. Chen. I will document my findings and forward them to him. Do you have any further questions for me?
PATIENT: No…no, I don’t think so. I suppose…I’ll call Dr. Chen’s office. Thank you, Doctor. I just…I hope it’s nothing serious. I think that’s all for now. I’m sure you have other patients waiting.
DOCTOR: Very well. My nurse will escort you to the scheduling desk. .
