DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Brightful. It’s a pleasure to meet you. My name is Dr. StHilaire. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Um… well, it’s about a surgery I’m hoping to have. I believe it’s a… clearance appointment? Honestly, the details are a bit fuzzy. My husband… he took care of most of the arrangements before… before he passed. I’m Mackenzi Brightful, by the way.
DOCTOR: Ms. Brightful, thank you for sharing that with me. I am very sorry for your loss. It's completely understandable that the details are a bit unclear right now. A clearance appointment is a good way to put it; it simply means we need to ensure you are healthy enough for the surgery you are planning. Before we proceed, could you tell me what type of surgery you are scheduled for?
PATIENT: Oh, thank you, Doctor. It was… quite a shock. The surgery… it’s… cosmetic, I think? It’s for my face. My cheeks, specifically. I… I don’t recall the exact name of the procedure. Something about lifting? It was something my husband wanted for me. He said it would… restore some of my confidence. I really don’t know much beyond that, I'm afraid.
DOCTOR: That’s quite alright, Ms. Brightful. We can certainly figure it out together. It sounds like you’re scheduled for a cheek lift, also known as a buccal lift or mid-face lift. It’s a very common procedure. To help me understand your overall health and ensure your safety, could you please tell me a little about your medical history?
PATIENT: Oh, a buccal lift… yes, that sounds right. My medical history… hmm. I’ve always been fairly healthy, I think. I had the usual childhood illnesses, but nothing major. No serious accidents or hospitalizations. I do have some… slight high blood pressure, but it's managed with a small dose of medication. And… I had a hysterectomy about ten years ago. Is that important? I’m really drawing a blank on everything else. I apologize.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all, Ms. Brightful. It's perfectly normal to feel overwhelmed. High blood pressure, even when managed, is certainly important information, thank you for letting me know. And the hysterectomy is good to have on record as well. Could you tell me the name of the medication you take for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh dear… that’s… difficult. I believe it’s a small white pill. I take it every morning. The name… it starts with an “A”, I think. Am I being terribly unhelpful? My husband always handled refilling the prescriptions and reminding me, so I never really paid attention to the name itself. I just know it keeps my blood pressure in check. Perhaps the pharmacy has a record?
DOCTOR: You’re not being unhelpful at all, Ms. Brightful. It’s very common for patients to not remember medication names, especially when they’ve been managed by someone else. We will find out. Knowing the dosage would be helpful if you recall that, but if not, we’ll get it from your pharmacy. In the meantime, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… Let me see. No known food allergies, thankfully. And I don’t think I’m allergic to any medications. I’ve never had a reaction to anything, as far as I know. I've had a little bit of sensitivity to some perfumes - they give me a headache sometimes, but that's not a true allergy, is it? Just a sensitivity. I haven’t used a new perfume in years, though. Nothing else comes to mind.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Ms. Brightful. A sensitivity to perfumes is helpful information, thank you. Now, could you tell me a little bit about your family's medical history?
PATIENT: Family medical history… That’s another area where I’m a bit fuzzy. My mother… she had some heart trouble later in life, I believe. She was on medication for it. And my father… he had diabetes. He was diagnosed when he was quite young. As for grandparents… I didn’t know them very well. They passed away when I was a child. I’m afraid I don’t have much more information than that. I never really asked a lot of questions, and my husband… well, he didn’t know much about my family either. I apologize for being so vague.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Brightful. Many people don’t have detailed knowledge of their family history. Knowing about your mother’s heart trouble and your father’s diabetes is helpful, though. Now, could you tell me a bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: My lifestyle… Well, I enjoy gardening, as you know, since I work in landscaping. It keeps me active, thankfully. I don’t smoke, and I only drink socially – maybe a glass of wine with dinner occasionally. I try to eat healthy, but I haven’t been very good at it lately. Grief… it takes away your appetite sometimes. I don’t exercise regularly, aside from the work I do. And… I don’t have any pets. I used to have a cat, but he passed away a few years ago. It’s just me now.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Ms. Brightful. It sounds like you lead a fairly active life despite everything. Now, I'd like to ask a few questions about your current health. Have you been experiencing any pain or discomfort lately?
PATIENT: Pain… not really. Aside from a bit of aching in my back sometimes from the work, nothing significant. I do get occasional headaches, but those are usually stress-related, I think. Nothing that requires medication. I haven’t been feeling ill or experiencing any fever, chills, or unusual fatigue. Just… tired, but that’s probably the grief. Overall, I’d say I’m in pretty good health, considering. But thank you for asking. I appreciate you being so thorough.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Brightful. It’s my job to be thorough. Now, I’d like to perform a brief physical examination. Just standard checks - blood pressure, heart rate, lung sounds, and a quick look at your face and neck. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s perfectly alright, Doctor. Please proceed. I understand it’s necessary. I'm ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Let's start with your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is a little elevated at 142/88, but that’s not unexpected given your history and current stress levels. Your heart sounds are regular, and your lungs are clear. Now, if you could open your mouth for me, I’d like to take a quick look at your throat. Your throat looks clear. Now, let's take a look at the area where you'll be having the procedure. There doesn’t appear to be anything unusual in terms of swelling or tenderness. Your skin has good elasticity. I'm noting some mild skin laxity in the cheek area, as expected. Do you have any concerns about any specific area?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, nothing specific. I just… I suppose I’m a little worried about the recovery. I’ve never had surgery before. And… I don’t have anyone to help me afterwards. My husband… he would have taken care of everything. But I’m managing, I suppose. I just hope it doesn’t hurt too much. And that I don’t look… strange afterwards.
DOCTOR: Those are very valid concerns, Ms. Brightful. It’s perfectly normal to feel anxious before a surgery, especially when it’s your first time. We'll discuss pain management options to ensure you’re comfortable during recovery. We can also discuss realistic expectations and what to anticipate in terms of post-operative swelling and bruising. As for having someone to help you, we can explore options such as a visiting nurse or even a friend or neighbor who could assist you in the initial days after the surgery. Let's focus on making a plan that works for you. Now, I’m noting your current medications are unknown, your blood pressure is slightly elevated, you have a history of a hysterectomy ten years ago, no known allergies, and a family history of heart trouble and diabetes. Based on this preliminary assessment, I believe you are generally a good candidate for the buccal lift, but we need to run some tests to get a clearer picture of your overall health. I'd like to order a complete blood count, a basic metabolic panel, and an EKG. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly alright. Whatever tests you deem necessary, I’m happy to undergo. I want to be sure I’m healthy enough, and I trust your judgment. I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything so thoroughly. When can I expect the results? And… where will I have the blood work done?
DOCTOR: Excellent. The lab work can be done right here in the clinic’s lab. I’ll write you a lab requisition slip now. You can usually get it done today, or tomorrow at the latest. The results typically come back within 24 to 48 hours. Once I have the results, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and finalize the surgical plan. In the meantime, is there anything else I can answer for you today?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything for now, Doctor. Thank you so much for your time and patience. You’ve been very kind and reassuring, and I feel much better knowing what to expect. I really appreciate it. I will get the lab work done as soon as possible. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Brightful. It was a pleasure meeting you, and I’m glad I could ease some of your anxieties. Don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. I look forward to seeing you then. Take care, and have a good day.
