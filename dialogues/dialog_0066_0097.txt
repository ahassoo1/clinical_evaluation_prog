DOCTOR: Hi Marija, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Condray. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Yes, hello Doctor. Well, my husband, he thinks it’s time. He’s very… practical. We need to get one of those forms, the one where you say what you want if… well, if things go badly. An advance directive, I believe he called it? I confess I haven’t looked into the details myself.
DOCTOR: Okay, an advance directive. Absolutely. It’s very responsible of both of you to think about this now. It's also called a living will, and it outlines your wishes for medical care if you're unable to speak for yourself. It's a really important document to have. Before we get into the specifics of that form though, is there anything else bringing you in today?
PATIENT: Really, Doctor, I came specifically for this form. I don’t understand why you ask about other things. Is this… standard procedure? My husband said it would be a simple matter of filling out the paperwork. I assure you, I am quite healthy for my age. It’s simply… foresight.
DOCTOR: You’re right to ask. It is standard procedure, and I apologize if I came across as dismissive. It’s just that, as your doctor, I want to make sure I have a complete picture of your health, even if you’re feeling well. It helps me understand the best way to support your wishes if a situation ever arose. But we can absolutely focus on the advance directive right now, if that’s what you prefer. Just so I can document everything properly, can you tell me if you have any current medical conditions, have had any surgeries, or take any medications?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor. This is becoming tedious. Very well. I had my tonsils removed as a child – a very common thing, I assure you. And… I occasionally take something for my allergies, during the spring. A simple over-the-counter antihistamine. Otherwise, I am perfectly fine. I eat a sensible diet, I exercise when I can, and I do not have any… “conditions.” Are we finally going to discuss the paperwork?
DOCTOR: Okay, tonsils removed as a child, and an over-the-counter antihistamine as needed for allergies. That's good to know. And yes, absolutely, let’s focus on the advance directive. To start, are you aware of the different parts of an advance directive?
PATIENT: Parts? No, Doctor, I am not. My husband explained the general concept – stating my wishes, should I become… incapacitated. I assumed it was a straightforward document. Is it not? I haven't the time for a complicated legal process. Perhaps you could simply explain it to me, rather than quizzing me on its "parts"?
DOCTOR: You're right to ask me to explain it. It should be straightforward, and I apologize if I’m making it seem complicated. There are generally two main parts: a living will, which outlines what types of medical treatments you want or don’t want if you can’t speak for yourself, and a durable power of attorney for healthcare, which names someone you trust to make medical decisions for you if you can’t. Think of the living will as your instructions, and the power of attorney as the person who carries them out. Does that make sense so far?
PATIENT: Yes, I believe so. Instructions, and… a representative. My husband has already designated himself as the representative, naturally. He is very… organized. So, this "living will"… is this where I list specific procedures? Like, whether I would want a machine to breathe for me, or… feeding tubes? Is that what this entails? Frankly, it sounds rather… grim.
DOCTOR: You’ve got it exactly right. That’s precisely what it entails – listing specific treatments you would or wouldn’t want. Things like mechanical ventilation, feeding tubes, CPR, dialysis… it covers a lot. And yes, it can feel grim to think about, but it's really about ensuring your wishes are respected, and taking some of the burden off your loved ones. We don’t have to go into detail about everything right away, if you're not comfortable. We can start with some general questions, and then get more specific as you feel ready. To begin, do you have any strong feelings about CPR – cardiopulmonary resuscitation – if your heart were to stop beating?
PATIENT: CPR? Good heavens, no. Absolutely not. I’ve seen enough… films. The breaking of ribs, the… indignity of it all. No, Doctor, I do not want CPR. It sounds barbaric. Write that down immediately. I would prefer… a peaceful passing, if it were to come to that. Is that an option?
DOCTOR: Absolutely. “No CPR” is a perfectly valid and important wish, and I’ve documented that. And yes, a peaceful passing is absolutely an option we can address. We would refer to that as allowing natural death. It means you wouldn’t want aggressive interventions to prolong your life if there’s no reasonable hope for recovery. Next question: What about mechanical ventilation?
PATIENT: Mechanical ventilation… another machine, I presume? No. Absolutely not that either. I have a… a very strong aversion to being hooked up to machines. It’s undignified. I would rather… not be kept alive artificially. Write it down. I do not want to be a burden. Is there a section where I can simply state "No machines, under any circumstances?" That might save us both some time.
DOCTOR: Yes, I’m documenting “No mechanical ventilation.” And you’re right, we can absolutely include a general statement about not wanting life-sustaining treatment, including machines, if that’s your preference. That can certainly streamline things. Now, this is a slightly more difficult question, but it’s important. What about a feeding tube if you were unable to eat or drink on your own?
PATIENT: A feeding tube? Doctor, are you deliberately trying to upset me? Honestly. Another machine, another indignity. No. Absolutely not. I have always taken pride in my… appearance, and the thought of being sustained by a tube… it’s appalling. Write it down. No feeding tube. Are we finished with the “machines” yet? Because I am beginning to feel quite faint.
DOCTOR: I apologize if I'm upsetting you, Marija. I assure you, that is not my intention. I'm simply trying to cover all the possible scenarios to ensure your wishes are fully documented. And yes, we’re almost finished with the “machines.” I’ve documented “No feeding tube.” The last thing is dialysis, if your kidneys were to fail. It's a process to clean your blood. Similar discussion?
PATIENT: Dialysis… another one? Honestly, Doctor, it’s like you’re deliberately trying to exhaust me. Very well. No. Absolutely not dialysis either. I do not want any further… interventions. I’ve made myself perfectly clear, haven’t I? No machines, no tubes, no… barbaric procedures. Just… let nature take its course. I think that covers it, doesn’t it? Can we finally get this document signed? My husband is expecting me home hours ago.
DOCTOR: You have been very clear, and I have documented “No dialysis.” I’ve also added a general statement reflecting your wishes to decline life-sustaining treatment. So, to recap: You are declining CPR, mechanical ventilation, feeding tubes, and dialysis. You've designated your husband as your durable power of attorney for healthcare. And you wish for a natural death, without further intervention, if you are unable to recover. Does that sound correct?
PATIENT: Yes, that is… perfectly correct. Finally. Now, if you could just present me with the document, I would be most grateful. I assure you, I have no intention of changing my mind. My husband will want to review it as well, of course, but I believe we have covered everything. Let’s just get this over with.
DOCTOR: Here you are. This is the advance directive, outlining all of your wishes. Please read it carefully. There are signature lines for you and two witnesses. Witnesses cannot be your husband, or anyone who would benefit from your care. I will also need to document that I discussed the implications of this document with you and that you signed it freely and voluntarily. Take your time, and please let me know if you have any questions at all.
PATIENT: There. Done. Now, about the witnesses… do you have anyone here who could… suffice? I really must be going. My husband will be furious.
DOCTOR: Unfortunately, I'm not able to serve as a witness myself. Let me see… Ah, the receptionist, Sarah, is available. She is not affiliated with your care and can serve as a witness. Would you like me to call her in?
PATIENT: Very well. Sarah, you say? Yes, call her. The sooner this is over, the better. Honestly, the bureaucracy of it all is quite exhausting. Just… hurry up.
DOCTOR: Sarah, could you come in here for a moment?
PATIENT: Yes, Dr. Condray? How can I help?
DOCTOR: Sarah, Marija has completed her advance directive, and needs a witness. Would you be willing to witness her signature?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. As long as it doesn't take too long. I have a schedule to keep, you know. And I do hope this isn't some sort of… complication. I've had quite enough of complications for one day.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Marija. Just let me verify your identity, and then you can sign. If you could sign and date here, please. And I'll add my signature and information as a witness.
PATIENT: There. Done. Now, if you'll excuse me, I really must be going. I trust that is everything? I do hope this document will finally put my husband’s mind at ease. Honestly, the stress of it all…
DOCTOR: Yes, Marija, everything is complete. I have a copy for your records, and I’ll ensure this is added to your chart. I'm glad we were able to get this done. I wish you a safe journey home, and I hope this brings your husband peace of mind. If you have any questions at all in the future, please don’t hesitate to call the office.
