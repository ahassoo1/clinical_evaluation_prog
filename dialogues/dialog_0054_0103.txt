DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Vankampen. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Dashevsky. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. Nice to meet you as well. Well, my back… it’s been botherin’ me somethin’ awful lately. Lower back, mostly. Feels kinda achy, all the time, and sometimes… sharp. It makes it hard to do things, you know? I used to be able to do anything, but now… not so much. It’s been goin’ on for a few months now, I think. Maybe longer? Time… it slips away, you know?
DOCTOR: Yes, time certainly does. Okay, so lower back pain for a few months, with both achiness and sharp pains. And it's making it difficult to do your usual activities. Can you tell me a bit more about what specifically makes it worse?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Well, bendin’ over is bad. Really bad. And liftin’… forget about liftin’ anything heavy. Even gettin’ outta a chair sometimes hurts. Standin’ for too long ain't good either. Funny thing is, restin’ doesn’t always help. Sometimes it does, but sometimes it just feels… stiffer, you know? Like an old machine that hasn’t been used in a while. And it’s worse in the mornin’, definitely worse when I first wake up.
DOCTOR: Okay, so bending, lifting, and prolonged standing aggravate it. Stiffness with rest, particularly in the mornings. And is the pain constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It's mostly constant, this dull ache. But then, outta nowhere, I'll get these sharp pains. Like a little… jolt. Those don't last long, maybe a few seconds, but they sure get my attention! They happen a few times a day, I’d say. The achin’ is always there though, even when I'm tryin' to sleep. Makes it hard to get comfortable, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand. Constant aching with sharp, intermittent jolts. And it impacts your sleep. Now, have you noticed any numbness or tingling in your legs or feet?
PATIENT: Hmm… Numbness… not really. Tingling… maybe a little, sometimes, in my feet. But not often. It’s hard to say if it's from the back or somethin’ else. I get cold feet sometimes, you know? Always have. But it doesn’t feel… pins and needles, if that makes sense. Just kinda… cold. It’s not a big problem, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, so occasional mild tingling, but no significant numbness or pins and needles. Just a sensation of cold feet sometimes. Have you had any recent injuries to your back, even minor ones?
PATIENT: No, not really. I didn’t fall or nothin’. It didn’t start after anythin’ specific, just… gradually got worse. I did twist myself a little bit reachin’ for somethin’ on a high shelf a few months back… maybe around the time it started. But it didn’t hurt then, not right away. Just started achin’ a little bit later. It was just a little stretch, nothin' major. I do a lot of gardenin’, so I’m bendin’ and twistin’ all the time. Maybe that had somethin’ to do with it?
DOCTOR: Gardening, bending and twisting... that's good information. Okay. And just to get a fuller picture, have you had any other medical problems in the past?
PATIENT: Well… I had my gallbladder out years ago. That was nothin’ really. And I have a little bit of trouble with my blood pressure, the doctor told me. Takes some pills for that. Nothing else major, I don’t think. Oh! And they told me my bones weren’t as strong as they should be. Said somethin’ about… osteoporosis. Is that right? I forget these things, you know. It was a while back. They didn’t do much about it, just told me to take some calcium.
DOCTOR: Yes, osteoporosis is important to know. Okay, so history of gallbladder removal, high blood pressure, and osteoporosis. And you mentioned taking medication for your blood pressure. Can you tell me what medications you’re currently taking, and the dosages, if you know them?
PATIENT: Let me see… I got this Lisinopril, it’s for the blood pressure. 20 milligrams, I think. I take one every mornin’. And then there's calcium with Vitamin D, just a regular one, once a day. That's it, really. No other pills. I try to keep it simple, you know? Don't like takin' too many things if I can help it. Here, you can look at the bottles if that helps.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril 20mg daily for blood pressure and calcium with Vitamin D daily. Thank you. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope, not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anythin’. I can eat anything, take anything, no problems. My wife used to try all sorts of new foods on me, and I was always fine. She loved cookin’, that one. But… that's another story. I haven't had any allergies since I was a little boy, and even then it was just a little bit of a rash from poison ivy, nothin' serious.
DOCTOR: Good to know. Alright, Mr. Vankampen, that gives me a good starting point. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical examination of your back and legs. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that's fine, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. Go ahead. I trust your judgement. Just try not to hurt me too much, eh? This back is a little sensitive, you know? But I'm ready. Let's see what's goin’ on.
DOCTOR: Of course. I’ll be as gentle as possible. First, I’m going to have you stand and I’ll just observe your posture from a few different angles. Then I’ll ask you to bend forward, backward, and to each side. Please just move as comfortably as you can and let me know if anything causes significant pain. Let's start with just standing normally. Can you show me how you usually stand?
PATIENT: Okay, sure. I think this is how I usually stand... maybe a little bit hunched over, I suppose. It's more comfortable this way, honestly. There. How's that? Is that what you want? It's not very graceful, I know. But it's me.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you. I notice a slight rounding of your upper back and a bit of muscle tightness on your right side. Now, if you’re comfortable, could you slowly bend forward from your waist, keeping your knees slightly bent?
PATIENT: Oh dear… here we go. Oof! That's not so good, Doctor. It hurts right here, in my lower back. And it feels kinda tight, like somethin' is blockin' me. I can't go much further without real pain. There. That's about as far as I can go. Sorry, I'm not very flexible these days.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you. I see limited range of motion and you’re experiencing pain with forward flexion. No radiating pain down your legs, is that correct?
PATIENT: That’s right. No pain goin’ down my legs. Just in my back, right here. It doesn’t shoot down or nothin’, just… stays right there. It’s a dull ache mostly, but it gets sharper when I bend like that. And then it kinda lingers for a bit afterwards, you know? Not pleasant at all.
DOCTOR: Okay. Now, if you are comfortable, could you gently bend backward, again keeping your knees slightly bent?
PATIENT: It’s not as bad as bendin’ forward, but I can still feel it. A pullin’ sensation, mostly, and a little bit of ache. Not shootin’ pain, just… uncomfortable. I don’t think I can go much further without makin’ things worse. There. That’s about it. I'm gettin’ old, Doctor. This back just doesn’t cooperate anymore.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you. Limited range of motion with extension, and discomfort. Now, could you gently bend to each side, keeping your knees slightly bent?
PATIENT: Bendin’ to the right is a little easier, but not by much. Bendin’ to the left feels tighter, and kinda pinches a little bit in my back. Not sharp pain, just… uncomfortable. There. That’s about as good as I can do, Doctor. My back is complainin’ pretty loudly now, I tell you.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you. Limited range of motion, tenderness in the lumbar region, especially on the right. I've observed your gait and haven’t noticed any significant abnormalities. Now, I’m going to have you lie on your back, and I’ll check your reflexes and sensation in your legs. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that's fine, Doctor. Whatever you need to do. Go ahead. I’m ready when you are. Just be gentle, eh? This old back is sensitive.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Vankampen. I’m going to check your reflexes in your knees and ankles. Then I’ll test the sensation in your feet and legs. I’ll use a soft brush and ask you to tell me if you can feel it. Just let me know if anything feels different or unusual. First, let’s check your reflexes. Could you relax your leg, please?
PATIENT: Okay, sure. Relax my leg… Like this? Just let me know if you need me to do somethin’ different. I'm ready when you are, Doctor. I'm a little bit nervous, to be honest. Never had all this done before.
DOCTOR: Okay. Just relax… and that’s good. We have a good reflex response there. Now we'll do the other leg. Good. The reflex is a little bit diminished on this side, but still present. Now, I’m going to test sensation. Can you tell me if you can feel this when I touch you?
PATIENT: Okay… I can feel it, Doctor, but it’s kinda… faint on this side. Not gone, just… not as strong. Like a little tingle, maybe? It’s hard to describe.
DOCTOR: Okay. That's helpful. Alright, Mr. Vankampen. That completes the physical examination. Based on what I've observed, you have limited range of motion in your lower back, tenderness on the right side, a slightly diminished reflex on your left side, and a subtle decrease in sensation in your left foot. Given your history and the exam findings, it appears you likely have lumbar strain, potentially with some mild nerve involvement. However, to rule out other possibilities, such as a herniated disc or spinal stenosis, I’d like to order an X-ray of your lower back. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Lumbar strain… sounds kinda scary. Nerve involvement? But an X-ray… yes, that’s fine. If that’s what you think is best, Doctor, then go ahead. I want to know what’s goin’ on, you know? It’s just… I don’t like too many tests, if that makes sense. But if you think it’s important, then I trust your judgement. So, an X-ray… where would I go for that? And how long does it take? I have a garden to tend, you know.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern about the tests, and I wouldn’t recommend them if I didn’t think they were necessary. The X-ray will help us to see if there’s any structural damage to your spine. It’s a quick and painless procedure. The radiology department is just down the hall. The nurse will give you a referral slip, and it usually takes about 30-45 minutes, including the wait time. In the meantime, I recommend continuing to take your calcium with Vitamin D, and I’d like you to start some gentle stretches and exercises to help strengthen your back muscles. I’ll have the nurse provide you with a handout detailing some appropriate exercises. Avoid any activities that worsen your pain, such as bending, lifting, or twisting. And, over the counter, you can take ibuprofen or naproxen as needed for pain relief, following the instructions on the label. We’ll discuss the results of the X-ray at your follow-up appointment next week. If your pain worsens significantly or you experience any numbness or weakness in your legs, please contact the clinic immediately. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Okay… gentle stretches, ibuprofen… no bendin’ or liftin’… Yes, that sounds alright. No bendin’ or liftin’ is gonna be tough, with the garden and all, but I’ll try my best. And the X-ray next week… and then we talk about it. The nurse will give me the handout and the referral slip? And she'll tell me about the exercises? That’s good. I appreciate that. I think… I think that’s all I need for now. Just… no bendin’ or liftin’. And I’ll try not to worry too much. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very helpful.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Vankampen. The nurse will be in shortly to provide you with the handout and referral slip. Don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. In the meantime, try to take it easy, and I hope you feel some improvement soon.
PATIENT: Thank you again, Doctor. I appreciate your help. I’ll try to take it easy.
