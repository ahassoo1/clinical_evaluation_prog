DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Nixon. I'm Dr. Chora. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor. Well, my left leg is quite swollen. It’s been… bothering me. And I have a bit of a heart thing, the doctor told me about it a while back – something about it fluttering, I think. It's called… atrial fib-rill-ation? Is that right? I don’t remember everything.
DOCTOR: Okay, Nixon. Swelling in your left leg and this… atrial fibrillation. Right. Let’s start with the leg. When did you first notice the swelling?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. I think it was maybe a week ago? It started just a little bit, and I thought it was just from walking too much. But it’s gotten worse each day. It’s not painful, really, just… big. And a bit uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Okay, a week ago, gradually worsening, no pain, just size and discomfort. Is it just the left leg, or is the right leg affected at all?
PATIENT: Just the left leg, Doctor. The right one is perfectly normal, as far as I can tell. I checked this morning, just to be sure. I noticed it getting worse after I was standing for a long time at the shops yesterday, though. Is that… important?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s good information. Standing for long periods can certainly play a role. And you said it’s been gradually worsening. Has anything else changed along with it?
PATIENT: Let me think… Well, I have been feeling a bit more tired lately, but I thought that was just the summer heat. And maybe a bit short of breath when I go up the stairs. Nothing major, but… noticeable, I suppose. Does that count?
DOCTOR: It absolutely counts, Nixon. Fatigue and shortness of breath are important things to mention, especially with the swelling and your history of atrial fibrillation. Okay, let’s move on to that “fluttering” you mentioned. When were you diagnosed with the atrial fibrillation?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That was… about two years ago, I think. The doctor at home told me about it. He put me on some medicine, small white pills, but… I stopped taking them a while back. I didn’t really feel much different, and I forget to take them sometimes. Is that bad? I should probably remember, shouldn’t I?
DOCTOR: It's important to be on medication as prescribed for atrial fibrillation, yes. Stopping it can increase your risk of complications. We’ll discuss that further. And you said you weren't feeling much different on the medication?
PATIENT: No, not really. I didn't feel worse off it, and I didn’t feel better on it, if that makes sense? It was a little difficult remembering to take it every day, and I thought maybe I didn't need it if I wasn’t feeling any problems. It just felt like… extra pills, really. Sorry, I don't mean to be difficult.
DOCTOR: No, you're not being difficult at all, Nixon. It’s good you’re telling me this. It helps me understand what’s going on. Alright. Now, let's do a quick physical exam. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, and then I’ll take a look at your leg. Would you mind climbing up there for me?
PATIENT: Oh, certainly, Doctor. No problem at all. Just let me know if I need to do anything. I am a bit… unsteady on my feet sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay. Your heart rate is a little fast, and irregular, as expected with the atrial fibrillation. Your lungs sound clear. And your left leg is significantly swollen compared to your right. It’s warm to the touch, but not particularly tender. I'm also noting some discoloration in the lower part of your leg. Do you have any pain in your calf when I bend your foot upward like this?
PATIENT: No, that doesn't hurt at all, Doctor. Not a bit. It feels… normal. Just a bit tight, perhaps, from the swelling, but no pain when you bend it like that. It’s just the size of it that’s worrying me, really. And the tiredness.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. No pain with dorsiflexion. The lack of pain is reassuring, but the swelling and discoloration still concern me. Given your history of atrial fibrillation, and the unilateral swelling, I'm concerned about a possible deep vein thrombosis, or DVT. To be sure, we'll need to order a Doppler ultrasound of your leg. It’s a non-invasive test that will show us if there’s a blood clot. Do you have any allergies to contrast dye?
PATIENT: Contrast dye? Oh, goodness. I don’t think so. I’ve never had any scans or anything like that before, so I don’t know if I’m allergic to it. I don't have any known allergies, though. I’m allergic to bee stings, but that's all I know of. Is contrast dye something they use for the ultrasound? Is it… painful?
DOCTOR: No, don't worry, a Doppler ultrasound doesn’t use contrast dye. I was just covering all bases. It’s a completely painless test - just like getting an echocardiogram. They’ll use a gel and a probe to look at the blood flow in your leg. I’m going to order that right away. While we’re waiting for that, let’s talk about your current medications. Besides the bee sting allergy, are you taking anything at all right now – even over-the-counter things, like vitamins or pain relievers?
PATIENT: Oh, right. No, nothing at all. Not even vitamins. I used to take a multivitamin, but I ran out months ago and didn’t bother getting more. Just the bee stings, really. And sometimes I take paracetamol for headaches, but not very often. Perhaps once a month, if that. It’s just… a little headache sometimes. Is that important, Doctor?
DOCTOR: It’s good to know. The paracetamol isn’t a major concern, but it’s important to have a complete picture. The ultrasound is ordered, they should be able to get you in within the hour. In the meantime, I’m going to prescribe a blood thinner, just as a precaution, while we wait for the results. It’s important to start this quickly if it is a DVT. Are you currently taking any other medications, including herbal supplements?
PATIENT: No, no herbal supplements. Nothing at all, Doctor. Really. I don’t really believe in those sorts of things. Just the occasional paracetamol. I haven’t even had a headache in weeks, so I haven’t needed any. A blood thinner… that sounds a bit scary, doesn’t it? Is it… dangerous? Will it make me bleed easily?
DOCTOR: It’s understandable to be concerned, Nixon. Blood thinners do carry a small risk of bleeding, but the risk of not treating a DVT is much higher. A DVT can travel to your lungs and cause a pulmonary embolism, which is very dangerous. The blood thinner will help prevent that. I'm going to start you on a low dose, and we’ll monitor you closely. We’ll also discuss some precautions you’ll need to take to minimize the risk of bleeding. Do you have a support system at home who can help you if needed?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. A pulmonary embolism… that sounds very serious, Doctor. Yes, I understand. A low dose sounds better. And yes, I live with my sister, Margaret. She’s very sensible and would help me with anything I needed. She drives, too, so she could take me to the doctor if needed. She’s a nurse, actually. A retired nurse. So she knows a bit about these things. Is that… helpful?
DOCTOR: That’s excellent, Nixon. Having a retired nurse as support is very helpful. Okay, I’m going to prescribe apixaban, 2.5mg twice daily. It's a newer blood thinner, so it has fewer interactions. I'll also give you a list of instructions and warning signs to look out for. We need to watch for any unusual bleeding, bruising, or signs of a stroke. I'm going to order a D-dimer test as well, to help rule out other causes of your leg swelling. Do you have any questions for me before we get you scheduled for the ultrasound?
PATIENT: Apixaban… twice a day. Right. And watch for bleeding, bruising… and stroke. Is that… difficult to remember? My memory isn’t what it used to be. And… what are the signs of a stroke, exactly? I keep forgetting. And what is a D-dimer test? It sounds… complicated.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly normal to be worried and to forget things. We'll go through it slowly, and I'll write everything down for you. The D-dimer is just a blood test, it can help rule out other conditions that cause leg swelling. It doesn’t tell us everything, but it’s a good starting point. As for the stroke, signs include sudden weakness on one side of the body, difficulty speaking, sudden severe headache, vision changes, or dizziness. I'm writing all of this down. For the apixaban, take one pill twice a day, with food. And try to remember to tell any doctor or dentist you’re on a blood thinner before any procedure. Do you want me to go over all of this again, slowly?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s very kind of you, Doctor. Yes, please. Slowly would be wonderful. And maybe you could write down the signs of a stroke in big letters? Just to be sure. My sister can read it over with me later, too. It’s just… a lot to take in, all at once. Thank you. I appreciate it very much.
DOCTOR: Of course, Nixon. That’s absolutely no problem at all. Sudden weakness on one side of the body… difficulty speaking… severe headache… vision changes… dizziness… And remember, if you experience any of these, call 911 immediately. Let's go over the medication again, just to be sure you understand. Apixaban, 2.5 milligrams, twice a day with food. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds right. Apixaban… two point five milligrams… twice a day… with food. I think… I think I can remember that. Food is good. I always take my pills with food. And the signs of a stroke… I have them written down. I think… I think I understand. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very patient with me.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Nixon. It’s my job. Now, let’s get you scheduled for that ultrasound. And please, don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns at all, even if it seems small. We’re here to help. Okay, they have an opening in one hour. Will that work for you?
PATIENT: One hour… yes, that should be fine. Margaret can drive me, and it gives me time to go over everything with her again. Thank you, Doctor. I feel a little… less worried now. Is there anything else I need to do before I go? Or can I just… wait for the ultrasound? .
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, Nixon. No, you don’t need to do anything else for now. Just wait for the ultrasound. And remember those warning signs. Here’s everything in writing, just in case. It was a pleasure meeting you, and please don’t hesitate to call if you think of anything. .
