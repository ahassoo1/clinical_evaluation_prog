DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Goodstein. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Gegan. It's nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. It is very nice to meet you as well. Well, it is… a little embarrassing, actually. I have… too much gas. Yes. A lot of it. It is… uncomfortable. And it happens often.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Goodstein, no need to be embarrassed at all. It’s a common issue. We can definitely look into this. When did this start happening?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It started… maybe six months ago? Perhaps a little longer. It was not so bad at first, just after meals. But it has gotten… more frequent. And sometimes… very loud. I apologize for mentioning that.
DOCTOR: No apology needed, Mr. Goodstein. It's important information. Six months ago, increasing over time… alright. And would you say it's related to any specific foods, or times of day, or anything like that?
PATIENT: That is a good question, Doctor. I have noticed… beans, yes. Beans are… a problem. And cabbage. Cabbage also makes it worse. But even with no beans or cabbage… it still happens. More often at night, I think. When I am relaxing. Perhaps because I eat dinner late? I am not certain.
DOCTOR: Okay, beans and cabbage seem to be triggers, and it’s more noticeable at night. Eating dinner late could certainly play a role. Besides the gas itself, are you experiencing any other symptoms along with it?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me see. Sometimes… a little bit of cramping. Not bad pain, just… uncomfortable. And I feel… bloated. Very full, even when I have not eaten much. No… no other problems, Doctor. Just the gas, the cramping, and feeling full. It does not cause me trouble sleeping, thankfully. Not yet, anyway.
DOCTOR: Alright, so gas, some cramping, and bloating, primarily after meals, worse with certain foods, and occurring more at night. No trouble sleeping yet. That’s helpful to know. Do you have any changes in your bowel movements?
PATIENT: Oh. Well… sometimes I am a little… constipated. Yes. Not often, but… it happens. Especially if I do not drink enough water, I think. It is… difficult to explain. It is not regular, but I do sometimes have trouble… going to the bathroom. And when I do… it is not always easy. I hope that is not too much information.
DOCTOR: No, that’s not too much information at all, Mr. Goodstein. It’s all very important. So, constipation sometimes, especially with inadequate fluid intake. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Do you have any other medical conditions that you've been diagnosed with?
PATIENT: Not really, Doctor. I have Medicare, so I see the doctor regularly. They check my blood pressure and things. Everything is usually… normal. I had a problem with my knee a few years ago, but that is fixed now. And… I do not have any allergies. I can eat anything, thankfully. Nothing serious. Just the usual old age things, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Okay, so regular check-ups, blood pressure is good, knee issue resolved, and no known allergies. That’s all good information. Do you take any medications currently?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I do not take any medications. I try to stay healthy. Sometimes, I take something for a headache. Just… ibuprofen. But not often. And nothing else. I prefer not to take pills if I can avoid it.
DOCTOR: Okay, ibuprofen as needed for headaches, otherwise no regular medications. Now, let’s briefly touch on your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… that is a difficult question. My mother… she had problems with her stomach. Indigestion, I think. And my father… he had a heart problem when he was older. But… that is all I can really remember. My family is… not very good at remembering these things. They do not talk about it much. I hope that is not too unhelpful.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Mr. Goodstein. It’s common for family medical history to be incomplete. Stomach issues in your mother and heart problems in your father—that’s useful to know. And finally, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: My lifestyle? Well… I work at the fast food place, so I am on my feet a lot. Not very strenuous, mostly counter work. I live alone. I do not smoke. I drink a little bit of coffee with breakfast. And I try to walk when I can. But… I do not exercise very much, I suppose. I enjoy reading. And watching television. Mostly news. It is a quiet life.
DOCTOR: Okay, so working on your feet, living alone, no smoking, some coffee, and enjoying reading and news. Thank you for sharing all of this, Mr. Goodstein. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. I’ll listen to your abdomen, and gently press on it to check for tenderness or any masses. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that is perfectly alright. Please, go ahead. I trust your judgment. I am happy to do whatever you need. I want to feel better, so I am willing to cooperate.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you could lie back on the examination table, that would be great. Okay. I'm not hearing any unusual sounds. And there's no noticeable tenderness when I press. It does feel a little bit distended, meaning your abdomen feels a bit full, but that could be related to the gas. I’m also going to check your reflexes and listen to your heart and lungs quickly, just to get a general picture. Everything sounds normal there as well. Given your symptoms – the gas, bloating, constipation, and the timing of it all – it sounds like you could be dealing with Irritable Bowel Syndrome, or IBS. It’s very common, and manageable. It’s also important to rule out other possibilities, though. I’d like to order a stool test to check for infection or inflammation, and a blood test to check your vitamin levels and rule out celiac disease. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Irritable Bowel… IBS, you said? That sounds… plausible. I have read about things like that on the internet. But it is good to know what it is actually called. A stool test and a blood test? Yes, Doctor, that sounds… sensible. If it helps to figure out what is going on, then I am happy to do it. Whatever you think is best. Please, go ahead and order the tests. I trust your judgment. When will I know the results?
DOCTOR: Excellent. I’ll get the orders sent to the lab right away. They’ll likely need a sample of your stool, and a small amount of blood. The lab will give you instructions on how to collect the samples. As for results, it typically takes about 3-5 business days for the lab to process everything. Once the results are back, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them in detail and create a plan. In the meantime, there are some things you can try at home. Avoiding trigger foods like beans and cabbage is a good start. Drinking plenty of water is crucial. And try to incorporate some gentle exercise into your routine, even just a short walk each day. Also, keeping a food diary could be helpful. Write down everything you eat and drink, and note any symptoms you experience afterwards. This can help us identify other potential triggers. Would you be willing to try that?
PATIENT: Three to five days… that sounds reasonable. And yes, a food diary… that is a good idea. I suppose it is worth a try. I can write things down, yes. So, no beans, cabbage, drink water, walk… and write down everything I eat. That all sounds… manageable. I will do my best to follow your instructions, Doctor. And I will let you know if anything changes. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly. Is there anything else I should be aware of?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Goodstein. And you're doing great—taking the first steps is often the hardest part. One thing to watch out for—if you develop any severe abdominal pain, fever, blood in your stool, or significant weight loss, please contact the office immediately. Those could be signs of something more serious, and we want to rule those out right away. Otherwise, try to stay relaxed and focus on making those small, gradual changes. We’ll figure this out together. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I believe you have answered all of my questions. You have been very helpful and patient. I am… much less worried than I was when I first came in. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me and explain everything so thoroughly. I will contact the office if anything changes, as you said. Thank you again, Doctor Gegan. I think I am ready to go now.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Goodstein. I'm glad I could help put your mind at ease. The nurse will be in shortly to review the lab orders with you and schedule a follow-up appointment. Please don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before then. Have a good day, and I’ll see you soon.
PATIENT: Thank you again, Doctor. You too. Have a good day. I look forward to seeing you soon.
