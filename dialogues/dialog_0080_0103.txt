DOCTOR: Hi Albino, it's lovely to meet you. I'm Dr. Rosanova. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Well, my back... it hurts. Lower back, mostly. It's been bothering me for a little while now, but lately it’s gotten worse. I think it's my bones, you know? My sister, she had trouble with her bones when she got older. They call it... osteoporosis, I think? Is that right?
DOCTOR: Okay, lower back pain, and it's been worsening recently. And you're concerned it might be related to osteoporosis, like your sister experienced?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. It’s just… a dull ache, most of the time. But sometimes, when I bend over, or twist… oof. It really grabs me. Makes me stop what I’m doing. It's not a sharp pain, just… uncomfortable. Very uncomfortable. I don’t do much heavy lifting anymore, so I don’t know what’s causing it. I mostly just… sit. A lot. For the fundraising, you see. Lots of phone calls.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a dull ache most of the time, with sharper pain when you bend or twist. And it's impacting your ability to do things, especially bending and twisting. You mentioned a lot of sitting for fundraising phone calls. When did you first start noticing this pain, Albino?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It started… maybe six months ago? Not too bad at first. Just a little stiffness in the mornings. I thought it was just getting old, you know? But then it started to happen more often. And now, like I said, it’s really bothering me when I try to do things. It’s been getting worse each month, I think. Definitely worse in the last two months. I don't remember anything specific causing it, just… started slowly.
DOCTOR: Alright, so it's been a gradual onset over about six months, with worsening pain in the last two months. No specific injury that you recall. Now, besides your back pain, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Let me see… well, I feel a little… shorter, maybe? My daughter keeps telling me I'm slouching more. She says it’s bad for my back. But I don’t feel like I've shrunk, really. And sometimes… my bones ache all over, not just my back. A little bit. It’s hard to explain. Just a general… achiness. I don't know if that makes sense. No fever, no numbness, nothing like that. Just achy. And maybe a little tired. But I'm 77, Doctor, so I'm always a little tired!
DOCTOR: Okay, so you've noticed some possible height loss and a general achiness in your bones, along with fatigue – which you understandably attribute to age. That’s helpful information. Let’s talk about your medical history for a moment. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Well, let me think… I had high blood pressure for a while, years ago. They gave me pills for it, and it went away. Now, the doctor says it's fine. Other than that… nothing much. I broke my wrist when I was a boy, playing football, but that healed fine. No surgeries, no serious illnesses. Just the blood pressure. And… oh! I had a bad case of the flu a couple of years ago, but everyone gets the flu, right? Nothing else I can think of. I haven’t been to the doctor much in the last few years, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of high blood pressure that’s now controlled, and a broken wrist as a child. No other significant medical history. And you haven't been to the doctor frequently recently. Now, are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing at all. I don't like taking pills if I can avoid it. My wife used to make me take vitamins, but she… well, she passed away a few years ago. And I just… haven’t started taking them again. Just nothing. Plain water and a little coffee, that’s about it. I try to eat healthy, mostly vegetables. My daughter worries about me, always telling me what to eat. But I manage.
DOCTOR: Alright, no current medications, vitamins, or supplements. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else, like food or pollen?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I don't think so. Never had a problem with allergies. I eat everything, pretty much. I've never had a rash or trouble breathing or anything like that. I live in the country, so there's pollen, of course. But it doesn't bother me. No allergies that I know of. Honestly, I’m a pretty simple man. Easy to please.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Now, let's talk a little about your family history. Has anyone in your family had problems with osteoporosis, arthritis, or any other bone or joint issues?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s what I was saying earlier. My sister, she had osteoporosis. Badly. She broke her hip a few years ago, and that’s when she found out. She's been on medication for it ever since. My mother, she had arthritis in her hands. Very painful, she said. Couldn't knit or anything. That’s about it, really. My father was healthy as a horse, never had any problems with his bones. But my sister and mother, yes. That’s why I’m worried about my back.
DOCTOR: Okay, a family history of osteoporosis in your sister and arthritis in your mother. That’s helpful to know. Now, just a couple more questions, and then I’d like to do a quick physical exam. What do you do on a typical day?
PATIENT: Oh, well… mostly I sit. I do a lot of phone calls for the fundraising. It's important work, you see. I talk to people, ask for donations for the hospital. It keeps me busy, but it doesn't keep me active, if you know what I mean. I get up and walk around the house, do a little gardening sometimes, but not much heavy work. Mostly just… talking on the phone and sitting. And watching the news. Not very exciting, I know. My daughter tries to get me to exercise, but… I'm not very good at it.
DOCTOR: Alright, so a lot of sitting and phone calls for fundraising, with limited physical activity. Now, one final question before the exam. Have you experienced any recent weight loss, changes in bowel habits, or any difficulty with urination?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No weight loss. I eat pretty well, like I said. My daughter makes sure of that! No changes in… well, no trouble with my stomach. And everything’s… normal, with urination. No difficulty there. Nothing like that. Just my back pain. That’s the only thing bothering me. I hope you can help, Doctor. It’s making it hard to do my work.
DOCTOR: Okay, Albino. That gives me a good starting point. Now, if you don't mind, I'd like to do a quick physical exam. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your reflexes, and then I’ll gently examine your back. I'll also measure your height and weight, if that's alright. Just to get a baseline.
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine, Doctor. Whatever you need to do. Height and weight is good. I haven't been weighed in a long time. Just… be gentle with my back, please. It’s a little tender. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me. It's good to know someone is trying to figure out what’s wrong. Go ahead.
DOCTOR: Alright, everything sounds clear with your heart and lungs. Your reflexes are a little slow, which isn’t uncommon at your age, but nothing too concerning. Now, let’s move on to your back. Please lie on your stomach on the examination table. Okay, can you tell me exactly where it hurts the most?
PATIENT: Oof. Yes, right… right there. And a little bit on the right, but mostly here. It's not a sharp pain, it's more like a deep ache. If you press on it… yes, right there. It feels tender. Not like a bruise, just… achy. Like a dull throb. And it hurts when I move, when I try to bend over. It's been worse lately, like I said. I hope you can find something, Doctor. It's making it hard to sleep, too.
DOCTOR: Okay, there is definite tenderness here, and bending forward and to the left seems to be the most painful. Your range of motion is somewhat limited, but again, that's not uncommon with age and back pain. Now, I'm going to measure your height and weight. Okay, your height is 150 centimeters, and your weight is 131 pounds. I'm also going to check your gait – just to see how you walk. Please stand up and walk a few steps for me.
PATIENT: Alright. I try to walk normally, but it's a little hard when my back is bothering me. I don't want to fall or anything. I'm a little unsteady, maybe. I don’t really walk much these days, like I said. Mostly just around the house. Is that okay? Is there anything else you want me to do? I hope you can see something, Doctor. This is a worry.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good enough, Albino. I see a slightly shuffling gait and a little forward lean, but nothing dramatic. Alright, based on what you’ve told me and the examination, I'm thinking this is likely musculoskeletal pain – meaning it's related to your muscles, bones, and joints. However, given your family history of osteoporosis and your age, I want to rule out any underlying bone issues. I’m going to order a Vitamin D level and a bone density scan, also called a DEXA scan, just to get a clearer picture of what’s going on. We will also get a complete blood count and metabolic panel.
PATIENT: Oh, a scan? Is that… is that painful? And blood tests? I don't like needles. But if you think it's necessary, Doctor, I'll do it. Vitamin D… my daughter keeps telling me I need more sunshine. Is that what that is? And the other tests, you said? What will those tell you? I just want to know what's wrong, and how to fix it. I don't want to be in pain all the time. Is it serious, Doctor?
DOCTOR: The DEXA scan is not painful at all, Albino. You simply lie on a table while a scanner passes over your body. It’s like a fancy X-ray, and it takes very little time. And yes, Vitamin D is important. Your body makes it when you’re in the sunshine, and it helps your bones stay strong. The blood tests will help us rule out other possible causes of your pain, like inflammation or infection. It's a standard procedure. I don’t think it’s necessarily serious at this point, but it’s important to get a diagnosis so we can manage it properly. It could be a simple muscle strain, or it could be something more. That's why we're doing the tests. We're being thorough. I’m going to prescribe you a mild pain reliever – naproxen – to help manage your discomfort while we wait for the test results. It’s an anti-inflammatory, which can help with muscle pain. We'll start with a low dose, and see how you tolerate it. Also, I’ll give you a handout with some gentle exercises you can do at home to strengthen your back muscles. But stop if they cause pain.
PATIENT: Naproxen… I think my sister took that. Is it safe? And exercises… I’m not very good at exercises. But I’ll try. If you think it will help. So, I need to get the scan and the blood tests, and take the pills, and do the exercises? How long will it take to get the results? And what if it is serious, Doctor? What then? I just want to know what I’m facing. And thank you, Doctor. For listening to me. It's a relief to finally be getting some answers.
DOCTOR: Naproxen is generally very safe for most people, but it can have side effects, like stomach upset. That’s why it's important to take it with food. We’ll also monitor your kidney function with the blood tests, just to be on the safe side. The results should be back in about a week. The lab will call you with the results, and then we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. If it is something more serious, like osteoporosis, we have treatments available. Medications can help strengthen your bones and reduce your risk of fractures. We will discuss all your options in detail if needed. The goal is to manage your pain, improve your quality of life, and keep you as healthy and active as possible. I'm glad I could help, Albino. And don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think that’s everything. You’ve been very helpful. Thank you. And I will call if I have any questions. It's a relief to know you’re taking it seriously. I just hope it’s not too bad. Thank you again, Doctor Rosanova. I appreciate your time and your kindness. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Albino. Take care of yourself, and don't hesitate to reach out. We'll figure this out together. Have a good day.
