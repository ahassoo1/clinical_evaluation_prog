DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Lason. It’s a pleasure to meet you. I’m Dr. Vodzak. So, to start, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Pleasure’s all yours, I suppose. My wife, she insisted I come. Says I’ve been…forgetful. Though I don’t see it that way. It's more like…people don’t explain themselves clearly these days. But fine, she worries. Says I have these…episodes. Little moments where I’m not quite…with it. It’s bothersome, really. And a waste of perfectly good time.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's very common for family members to notice changes before we do ourselves, and it’s good of your wife to be proactive about your health. These "episodes," as you call them—could you describe one for me?
PATIENT: Describe one? Hmm. Well, just last week, we were at the market – you know, the one by the river? – and I was picking out mangoes. Perfect mangoes, mind you, the kind with just the right give. And old man Hem… Hem, yes, that’s it, Hem—he started talking to me about… I don’t know what. Something about his chickens. Just rambling on and on. And I… I couldn’t follow it. Couldn't grasp what he wanted from me. It was irritating. My wife had to step in and explain. She said I was just staring blankly. Blankly! I was thinking. Thinking about the mangoes, of course.
DOCTOR: I see. So it sounds like you experienced some difficulty following the conversation with Mr. Hem at the market, and your wife observed you appearing…distant during that interaction?
PATIENT: Distant! That’s putting it mildly. She makes me sound like an empty-headed fool. It wasn’t that I was distant, Doctor, it was that his story was nonsense. Complete and utter nonsense. And she always jumps to conclusions, my wife. Always. But… alright. Yes, I suppose I wasn’t… fully engaged with what he was saying. It just didn't make sense. And I got…flustered, maybe. A little. Doesn't mean I was staring "blankly," though.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Lason. It’s perfectly reasonable to feel annoyed when a conversation doesn’t flow easily, and it sounds like your wife has a different perspective on what happened. To help me understand the situation better, have you noticed this happening in other situations besides the market?
PATIENT: Other situations… hmm. Let me think. Yes, actually. A few weeks before the market, I was helping my grandson with his… his schoolwork. Numbers, I think. Something about fractions. He was trying to explain it to me, and… it didn't click. He kept using these new terms, these fancy ways of saying things, and I just couldn’t follow his logic. He got frustrated, naturally. Said I wasn't listening. But I was listening! It's just… they teach these things differently now. Completely unnecessarily complicated. It's not like I've forgotten how to add and subtract.
DOCTOR: Okay, so difficulty with following explanations and a feeling of frustration in both instances. And it sounds like there's a component of things feeling unnecessarily complicated. Has this been a gradual change, or did it seem to come on more suddenly?
PATIENT: Gradual? Sudden? Honestly, Doctor, I haven't been keeping a calendar of my mental faculties. But I’d say… gradual. It’s been creeping up on me, I suppose. For years, things have been getting more… convoluted. The younger generation and their… ways. But it's hard to say exactly when it started. My wife would probably say it was five years ago, the moment they invented these… touchscreen devices. But I don't see it that way.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Mr. Lason. It's often difficult to pinpoint exactly when changes occur. It's helpful to know it's been a gradual process. Now, apart from the difficulty following conversations and explanations, have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Other changes… Let me think. Well, my appetite hasn’t been what it used to be. Not that I need to eat a lot. I’m not a large man, as you can see. But sometimes… I just don’t feel hungry. And I’ve been… a little more irritable, perhaps. Snappish, my wife says. But honestly, it’s hard to be pleasant when people are constantly talking nonsense or inventing new ways to say simple things. It wears a man down, Doctor, it really does.
DOCTOR: I understand. Loss of appetite and increased irritability. Thank you for sharing that. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any significant medical conditions, like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart disease?
PATIENT: High blood pressure… the doctor mentioned something about that, years ago. Said I needed to watch my salt intake. I’ve tried, I really have. But my wife likes to cook with fish sauce, and well, a man can only take so much. Diabetes… no, never. Heart disease… no. I’ve always been a fairly active man, even now I still tend to the garden. Nothing major, really. A few aches and pains, what do you expect at my age? But nothing a good night's sleep won’t fix. Except for the noise the neighbors make, that is.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of slightly elevated blood pressure, but generally good health otherwise. And you’ve been generally active. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything significant?
PATIENT: Surgeries… let me think. Years ago, when I was still in Cambodia, I had my appendix taken out. Very unpleasant experience, I assure you. And… oh, when I broke my wrist falling off the roof while repairing it after a storm. That needed some attention. But nothing recently, Doctor. Nothing in the last, oh, twenty years or so. And I don’t go to hospitals if I can avoid it. They’re filled with germs and unpleasant smells.
DOCTOR: Okay, appendectomy and a broken wrist in the past. Thank you. Now, let’s talk about your family. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family… hmm. My mother, she lived to a very old age, but she had… well, she was a little forgetful in her later years. My wife says that’s genetic. She always has to have an explanation for everything. My father… he was a strong man, but he had some trouble with his heart near the end. And my brother… he had some sort of illness when he was young, a fever that left him weak. But honestly, I don’t pay much attention to family medical history. Everyone gets old and sick eventually, that’s just life.
DOCTOR: I understand. A family history of some forgetfulness, heart trouble, and an illness in your brother. Now, just a few more questions before we move on to a brief physical exam. Do you take any medications regularly, including over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications… well, the doctor gave me some pills for my blood pressure, years ago. I don’t take them very often, though. They make me feel… sluggish. And my wife gives me some herbal supplements she buys from the market. Something about improving circulation. Honestly, I don’t know what’s in them. She just says they’re “good for me.” And sometimes I take something for my aches and pains, when they get really bad, but it’s just ibuprofen, nothing fancy.
DOCTOR: Okay, intermittent blood pressure medication, herbal supplements your wife provides, and ibuprofen as needed. And finally, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No, not really. I get a little itchy sometimes when I'm bitten by mosquitoes, but that's hardly an allergy. And I don't eat shellfish, but that's a matter of taste, not a reaction. I don’t think I have any serious allergies, Doctor. I’ve lived a long life without any major incidents, so I doubt I’m allergic to anything important.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Mr. Lason. Thank you for answering all of my questions so thoroughly. Now, if you don’t mind, I’d like to perform a brief physical exam to get a better understanding of your overall health. We’ll just check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and do a simple neurological assessment. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Fine, fine. Get it over with. But don't expect miracles, Doctor. I’m an old man. And be quick about it, I have things to do. My garden won't weed itself, you know.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Lason. We’ll be as efficient as possible. Please have a seat here, and we’ll start with your blood pressure. Okay, your blood pressure is a little elevated, 148 over 85. We’ll want to keep an eye on that. Your heart sounds regular, but there is a slight murmur. It’s not alarming, but we should monitor it. Now, I’m going to ask you to follow my finger with your eyes. Your reflexes are a little slow, but within normal limits for your age. And your coordination seems fine. Overall, everything seems within acceptable ranges, but the elevated blood pressure and slight heart murmur warrant further investigation.
PATIENT: Further investigation? What does that even mean? More tests? More poking and prodding? Honestly, Doctor, I don't see the point. I feel fine, mostly. A little tired, perhaps. And my wife worries too much. Is it something serious? Because I really don’t have time for serious. My mango tree needs pruning, and the beans need harvesting.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Lason. It doesn't necessarily mean anything serious, but it's always best to be thorough. "Further investigation" means we’d like to run some blood tests to check your overall health, including your cholesterol, blood sugar, and kidney function. We’ll also do an EKG—that’s a simple test that records the electrical activity of your heart—to get a better look at that slight murmur I heard. It's a precaution, really. It will help us rule out any underlying issues and ensure you’re in good health. Based on your symptoms—the forgetfulness, difficulty following conversations, loss of appetite, and irritability—and the findings from the physical exam, I'm also considering the possibility of mild cognitive impairment. The blood tests will help rule out other causes, such as vitamin deficiencies or thyroid problems. And we can discuss the results and decide on the best course of action from there. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Mild… what now? Cognitive… impairment? Are you saying I’m losing my mind? Honestly, Doctor, that's ridiculous. I may not remember every little detail, but I’m perfectly capable of running my garden, fixing things around the house, and knowing when the mangoes are ripe. I’m not senile! And blood tests… fine, fine. But I don’t want to spend all day at the lab. I have things to do. And I don’t want any surprises. Tell me straight what you’re looking for, and how long this is going to take. And no complicated explanations, please. Just the facts.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Lason, and I apologize if I caused any alarm. "Mild cognitive impairment" simply means there’s a slight decline in cognitive function—things like memory and thinking—that isn’t severe enough to interfere with your daily life. It’s not the same as dementia or senility. It’s often caused by age-related changes in the brain, but it can also be caused by other factors, such as vitamin deficiencies or thyroid problems. That’s why we’re running the blood tests—to rule out those other factors. The blood tests will take about 30 minutes at the lab, and the results should be back in a few days. The EKG will only take a few minutes. Once we have the results, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them in detail. If the blood tests are normal, we may consider further testing, such as a simple cognitive assessment—that’s a series of questions designed to evaluate your memory and thinking skills. However, let’s not jump to conclusions. We’ll take things one step at a time. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: One step at a time… Fine. But I’m telling you, Doctor, there’s nothing wrong with my thinking. I just get irritated when people talk nonsense. And my wife worries too much. 30 minutes at the lab… alright. But no long waits, and no complicated procedures. Just the blood tests, the EKG, and then let me get back to my garden. And no unnecessary tests, understand? I’m an old man, not a science experiment. And what about these herbal supplements my wife gives me? Should I stop taking those? They smell awful, frankly.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Lason, I understand perfectly. No long waits, no complicated procedures, and no unnecessary tests. We will focus on the blood tests and EKG for now, and we'll take it from there. Regarding the herbal supplements, yes, I would recommend stopping those until we have the blood test results. It's always best to avoid taking anything unnecessary when we're trying to determine the cause of your symptoms. They could potentially interfere with the results or have unforeseen side effects. It's best to be cautious. I'll write you a lab order and a brief note explaining what we're looking for. The lab technician will take care of everything. Once you have the results, please schedule a follow-up appointment with me, and we'll discuss them in detail. Do you have any other questions or concerns before we finish?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s all. Just get it over with, so I can get back to my garden. Honestly, Doctor, I appreciate you listening to me, but I still think my wife is overreacting. But fine, I’ll do the tests, just to appease her. And if everything comes back normal, I expect a full apology. Thank you.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Lason. I completely understand. We'll take things one step at a time, and we'll do our best to get to the bottom of this. I will prepare the lab order and the note for you now. And, regardless of the results, I’ll be happy to discuss them with you and address any concerns you may have. Thank you for coming in today. I'll have the receptionist send the orders to the lab and schedule your follow up appointment. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or experience any new symptoms. Have a good day, and enjoy your garden.
PATIENT: .
