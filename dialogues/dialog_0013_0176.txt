DOCTOR: Hi Ivette, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Morenomartinez. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, it’s these hiccups. They just won’t stop. Been going on for… let me think… more than two days now, easily. It's really getting on my nerves.
DOCTOR: Okay, hiccups for more than two days. That is annoying. Can you tell me a little more about them?
PATIENT: Well, they started… hmm… Tuesday, I think it was. Just out of the blue, really. I was… organizing some things for a party I’m putting together, actually. And then hic… one hiccup. Then another. And they haven't really let up since. It doesn’t seem to matter what I do – drinking water, holding my breath… nothing works for very long.
DOCTOR: Alright, so they started Tuesday while you were organizing for a party, and you've tried the usual tricks – water, holding your breath – without much relief. Are the hiccups constant, or do they come and go?
PATIENT: They come and go, but mostly come. Like, there are little breaks, maybe ten or fifteen minutes where I don’t have any, but then they start right back up again. It's not a huge, forceful hic every time, sometimes it's just… a little flutter, you know? But it's constant enough to be really distracting.
DOCTOR: Okay, intermittent but frequent hiccups, starting Tuesday, and sometimes they're more like flutters than big, strong ones. Have you noticed anything that seems to trigger them, or make them worse?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. I haven’t really noticed anything specific. I was eating something spicy on Monday, maybe that had something to do with it? But I eat spicy food pretty regularly, so I wouldn’t think so. And I’ve been pretty stressed with getting everything ready for this party… lots of little details to manage.
DOCTOR: Spicy food sometimes, and you've been under stress with the party planning. Okay. Let's talk about your overall health a bit. Do you have any other medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Not really. I’m generally pretty healthy, I think. I get a bit tired easily, but that’s probably just from running around so much. Oh, and my back aches sometimes, but I think that's just from… well, getting older! Nothing a bit of rest doesn’t fix. I don’t take any regular medications, and I haven’t been to the hospital for anything serious in… oh, goodness, years.
DOCTOR: Okay, generally healthy, some fatigue and occasional back pain, no regular medications, haven’t been hospitalized in years. Good to know. Any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: No, no surgeries. Never had any. I've been lucky, I suppose. Mostly just the usual bumps and scrapes over the years. I did have my tonsils out when I was a little girl, but that was ages ago.
DOCTOR: Okay, no surgeries aside from tonsils as a child. And what about your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… family history… My mother had high blood pressure, and my father had… well, he had a lot of little aches and pains, like me, but nothing serious enough to be diagnosed, really. My brother is perfectly healthy, as far as I know. No major illnesses that run in the family, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Okay, family history of high blood pressure in your mother, some aches and pains in your father, brother is healthy. Let's talk about your lifestyle. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: No, never smoked. Never even tried it, actually. I don’t like the smell, and it just seems… unhealthy.
DOCTOR: Good. And how about alcohol?
PATIENT: I have a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, maybe three or four times a week. Nothing more than that. Just a small glass, to relax. I don’t really drink beer or hard liquor.
DOCTOR: Okay, a small glass of wine a few times a week. And finally, are you allergic to anything?
PATIENT: Not that I know of. I haven’t had any bad reactions to anything, ever. I eat all sorts of foods, and I haven’t had any problems. I did get stung by a bee once when I was a child, but I just got a little swelling. Nothing major.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Alright, Ivette, let's do a quick physical exam. I'm just going to listen to your heart and lungs, and have a look in your throat and ears. Then I'll feel your abdomen. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s perfectly fine. Go ahead. I hope it’s nothing serious! This is just… really irritating.
DOCTOR: Okay, everything sounds and feels normal so far. Your heart rate is a little fast, but that could be from the stress and the hiccups themselves. No obvious tenderness in your abdomen, and your throat and ears look good. Given the duration and the fact that they haven't responded to typical remedies, I'm going to order a basic blood test to rule out anything underlying. It will check your electrolyte levels, and a complete blood count just to make sure everything looks okay. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds very sensible. Blood test sounds good. I just want to get rid of these hiccups! I’m happy to do whatever it takes to find out what’s causing them. Will it take long to get the results?
DOCTOR: It usually takes about 24-48 hours for the results to come back. I’ll have the lab results sent directly to me, and then I’ll give you a call as soon as I’ve had a chance to review them. In the meantime, if the hiccups get significantly worse – if they become very painful, or if you have trouble breathing – please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Is that clear?
PATIENT: Yes, perfectly clear. 24-48 hours, and go to the emergency room if they get worse. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to look into this. I'll try to relax in the meantime, though that’s easier said than done with all this hic… you know.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ivette. I understand it's frustrating. We'll get to the bottom of this. I'll get the lab order sent over to the front desk for you now. They'll give you instructions on where to go for the blood draw. And please, don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before I call you with the results. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you again, Doctor Morenomartinez. I really appreciate it.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ivette. Get some rest, and I'll be in touch soon.
