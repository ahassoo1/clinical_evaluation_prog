DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Baide. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Rakosky. It’s good to meet you. Now, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Ugh, finally. Look, Doctor, don't bother with the small talk. It's this hand. Shakes like a leaf, it does. Been happening for… well, a while now. Honestly, it's embarrassing. Just want something to stop it, if that’s possible. Don’t have time for a lot of questions, you understand? I got things to do.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Baide. I understand you’re frustrated and want to get to the bottom of this hand tremor quickly. We’ll do our best to be efficient. “Been happening for… a while now” – could you be a bit more specific?
PATIENT: Specific? Honestly, who keeps track of that stuff? Maybe six months? A year? It comes and goes, you see. Worse when I'm… trying to do things. Like holding a glass, or… well, never mind. It just is. And it’s getting worse, that’s what matters. Look, I used to be a producer, a director, important things, okay? I can’t have my hand shaking when I’m… when I was… never you mind. Just fix it. Is that so hard?
DOCTOR: No, it’s not hard, Mr. Baide, and I appreciate you sharing that with me. It's helpful to know the impact this is having on your life. Six months to a year… that gives us a starting point. And it's worse with intentional movements, like holding a glass. Just to clarify, is the shaking present when your hand is at rest, or only when you’re actively trying to do something with it?
PATIENT: Rest? What do you mean, 'rest'? It's… mostly when I use it. Like when I’m trying to sign something, or… eat. Sometimes when I'm trying to point at something. It’s not… constant, see? It just flares up. I don't sit around resting my hand, Doctor. I have things to do. Is that clear enough? Honestly, all these questions... Are you a doctor or an interrogator?
DOCTOR: I apologize if my questions feel intrusive, Mr. Baide. I assure you, I’m simply trying to gather enough information to understand what’s going on and determine the best course of action. It’s important to differentiate between different types of tremors, and your description is very helpful. So, it sounds like it’s primarily an action tremor – meaning it happens when you’re actively using your hand. Does the tremor affect one hand, or both?
PATIENT: One hand! What are you, dense? Look at it! This hand. The right one. Always been the good one, now look at it. Shaking like a chihuahua in winter. The other one is… fine. Perfectly fine. Never had a problem with it, and frankly, I don’t want to start now. Just deal with this one, alright? Are we getting anywhere, or are we just going in circles? I haven't got all day.
DOCTOR: Right hand, and it’s been consistent in that hand for the past six to twelve months, worsening with use. Thank you for clarifying, Mr. Baide. Now, I'd like to perform a brief physical examination of your hands and nervous system to get a better understanding of the tremor. This will involve me observing your hands at rest and during movement, checking your reflexes, and assessing your muscle strength. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Ugh, more poking and prodding? Honestly. Fine. Get it over with. But don’t take all day, alright? And be gentle. I'm not some young whippersnapper anymore. Just… hurry up. I have appointments, you know. Important appointments. Don’t want to be late.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Baide. I’ll be as quick and gentle as possible. Okay, could you keep your arms extended like that for a moment?
PATIENT: Look, this is ridiculous. They’re getting tired already. What are you looking for, exactly? It shakes, we already established that. This isn't some kind of magic trick, you know. Just… get on with it. This is embarrassing. People will think I’m feeble.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Baide. I’m observing the tremor at rest, and noting its characteristics. It appears to be a resting tremor with a slight component when you are trying to maintain that position. Now, could you please try to tap your thumb against your fingers repeatedly, as quickly as you can?
PATIENT: There. Happy now? It's shaking, alright? See? It's not exactly a virtuoso performance, if that's what you were hoping for. I used to be able to do things… important things. This is just… frustrating. Just tell me what's wrong with it, instead of making me do silly exercises.
DOCTOR: I observed the tremor during the tapping exercise as well. Now, I’m going to gently check your reflexes in both arms and assess your muscle strength. This will just involve me asking you to resist against my hand as I try to move your arm. Your reflexes are a little diminished on the right side, and there’s mild weakness in your grip strength compared to your left hand. Do you have any family history of tremors or neurological conditions?
PATIENT: Neurological… what? Look, my mother… she had arthritis, terrible arthritis. That’s all I know. My father… he was a strong man, worked with his hands. Never sick a day in his life. As for tremors… no. No one in my family shook like this. This is new. This is… unnerving. Just tell me what it is, Doctor. Is it serious? I don’t have time for… for anything serious.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Baide. Based on the examination – the resting tremor, diminished reflexes, and mild weakness in your grip strength – it’s possible you’re experiencing early signs of essential tremor. However, it’s also important to rule out other potential causes, such as Parkinson’s disease or other neurological conditions. To do that, I’d like to order a few blood tests to check for underlying medical conditions and consider a referral to a neurologist for further evaluation and, potentially, a DaTscan to help differentiate between essential tremor and Parkinson’s disease. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: DaT… what? Look, tests, scans… more poking and prodding? This is getting ridiculous. I just wanted something to stop the shaking, not a whole battery of tests. A neurologist? That sounds expensive. And time-consuming. Look, Doctor, frankly, I’m not sure I want to go down that rabbit hole. Is it… is it going to change anything? Will it fix it? If not, I don’t see the point. Maybe I just need a stronger pill. Something to calm my nerves. Is that an option?
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Mr. Baide, and I want to assure you I wouldn’t recommend these tests lightly. The purpose isn’t to simply add to your anxieties, but to obtain a more accurate diagnosis so we can determine the best course of action. While a “stronger pill” might temporarily alleviate some of your symptoms, it won't address the underlying cause and could potentially mask important warning signs. Essential tremor, if that is indeed what you have, is a progressive condition. Early diagnosis allows us to monitor its progression and discuss management options, such as medication, physical therapy, or, in some cases, more advanced treatments like focused ultrasound. Regarding the cost, we can discuss your Medicare coverage and explore potential options to minimize your out-of-pocket expenses. However, if you are strongly opposed to further testing at this time, we can discuss symptom management options, such as beta-blockers or anti-seizure medications, that may help reduce the tremor’s severity. But I strongly advise against foregoing a thorough evaluation, as an accurate diagnosis is crucial for long-term care. What are your thoughts?
PATIENT: Look, you’re a doctor, alright? You’re supposed to fix things, not just run tests and talk about… progression. My wife… she always said I hated doctors. Just wanted to tell me what was wrong, not give me a lecture. Alright, fine. Do the tests. The blood tests, whatever. But I’m not promising I’ll go see a neurologist. And I expect a quick turnaround. I don’t have time to sit around waiting for results. Just… get it done. And try to be gentle, alright? This is unnerving enough as it is.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Baide. I understand your frustration and I will do my best to expedite the process. I'll order the blood tests right away, and the lab will contact you to schedule an appointment. I’ll also provide you with a referral to a neurologist, should you decide to pursue that option. I’ll also write a prescription for a low dose of propranolol, a beta-blocker, to see if it helps alleviate some of your symptoms in the meantime. Do you have any allergies to medications we should be aware of?
PATIENT: No. Not that I know of. My wife always handled the pills. I just… took them. But I don’t think so. No allergies. Just… a general aversion to doctors. And tests. Is that an allergy?
DOCTOR: I understand. No, that's not an allergy, Mr. Baide. We’ll note “no known allergies” in your chart. Okay, I’ve ordered the blood tests and written the prescription for propranolol. You can pick it up at your preferred pharmacy. The lab results should be available within a few days. I'll have my nurse contact you as soon as they're in. Here’s the referral to the neurologist, just in case. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No. No questions. Just… get me out of here. I have things to do. Important things. Thank you… I suppose. But frankly, I’m not optimistic. Doctors never seem to fix anything. .
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Baide. I understand. I’ve printed out your lab order and the prescription for you. Please don’t hesitate to contact the office if you have any questions or concerns. We're here to help in any way we can. Have a good day, despite everything.
