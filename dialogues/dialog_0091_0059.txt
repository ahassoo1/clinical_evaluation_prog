DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Swaby. My name is Dr. Talen Delacour. It's a pleasure to meet you. I see here you’re nineteen years old. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you too. Um… well, honestly, it’s a bit difficult to explain. I’ve been… having trouble with my speech, I suppose. It’s like… words aren't coming out right sometimes. It’s been happening for a little while now. I don't quite recall when it started, though.
DOCTOR: I understand. It can be concerning when you notice changes in your speech. “Trouble with your speech” is a bit broad, Ms. Swaby. Could you elaborate on what you mean by “not coming out right”?
PATIENT: Oh, certainly, Doctor. It’s… hard to describe. Sometimes they just… slur together, you know? Like I’m not fully forming the words. And other times, I… I just can't find the right word, even though I know what I want to say. It’s quite frustrating, really. Does that make any sense? I apologize for being so vague; my memory isn't what it used to be.
DOCTOR: That does make sense, Ms. Swaby, and you aren’t being vague at all. Slurring and difficulty finding the right words are both important details. To help me understand the timeline a bit better, would you say this has been a gradual process over weeks or months, or did it come on suddenly?
PATIENT: Oh dear… that’s a tricky one. Honestly, I really couldn’t say, Doctor. Things… haven’t been very clear lately, you see? I think it was gradual. It wasn't like one morning I just woke up and couldn't speak properly. More like… little stumbles here and there that got worse over time. But I honestly can’t pinpoint exactly when it started. I apologize for being so unhelpful. Is that alright?
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly alright, Ms. Swaby. It’s not uncommon for these things to be difficult to recall precisely. We’ll work through it. And please, don’t apologize for anything. Now, has this difficulty with speech been constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It definitely comes and goes, Doctor. Some days are much better than others. There are times when I feel perfectly fine, and I can speak normally, like I’m not having any trouble at all. But then, other times… like today, sometimes… it’s much worse. It seems to be… random, I suppose. I haven't noticed anything that specifically makes it better or worse, though I’m trying to remember if there is something. It's just… difficult.
DOCTOR: I see. Random fluctuations are important to note. To get a more comprehensive picture, could you tell me if this issue is accompanied by any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… hmm. Let me think. Well, I’ve been feeling rather tired lately, more tired than usual, I suppose. And sometimes… my vision gets a little blurry. Not constantly, just… occasionally. It doesn’t last long, though. Oh! And I’ve had a few headaches, but I get those often, so I didn't think much of it. Is any of that helpful, Doctor? I’m really trying to recall everything.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s all very helpful, Ms. Swaby. The fatigue, blurry vision, and headaches are all relevant. Now, regarding the headaches – could you describe them to me?
PATIENT: Oh, certainly. They're… not terribly severe, usually. More like a dull ache, around my temples. They don’t throb, just… a constant pressure. And they aren’t usually debilitating; I can still go about my day. But they are more frequent lately, I think. I usually just take some paracetamol and they subside. I hadn't really thought they were connected to anything else, to be honest. I just assumed it was stress.
DOCTOR: I understand. Stress can certainly contribute to headaches. Ms. Swaby, I’d like to ask a few questions about your past medical history, if that’s alright. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. Let me see… Well, I was diagnosed with… mild hypertension a few years ago, I believe. The doctor put me on medication for it, and I've been taking it regularly. Other than that… I don't recall anything significant, honestly. I had the usual childhood illnesses, but nothing major. And I've had regular check-ups with my family doctor, but everything was always fine. Do you need any more details about the hypertension, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Yes, please. Could you tell me the name of the medication you take for your hypertension?
PATIENT: Oh dear… That's… a bit of a problem, Doctor. I really can't recall the name of the medication. My husband usually manages my prescriptions, so he would know. I apologize. I feel terribly foolish admitting this, but my memory is just… not what it used to be. I can certainly ask him when I get home, though. Would that be alright?
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly alright, Ms. Swaby. Don’t worry about it at all. It's much more important that you're receiving treatment, and we can easily obtain the details from your pharmacy records. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for any reason?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I haven't. I’ve thankfully never needed surgery or been hospitalized. I've always been quite healthy, aside from the hypertension, of course. I’ve been lucky in that regard. I do get a bit anxious about hospitals, to be honest. It’s… a bit of a silly fear, I suppose, but I just don’t like being around them.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly understandable, Ms. Swaby. Many people feel that way. Now, are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Oh, um… let me think. My grandmother, on my mother’s side, had… dementia, I believe. And my father’s side… there’s a history of diabetes, I think. Several of his siblings have it. Other than that… I’m not really sure. We don’t talk about medical history much in my family, to be honest. It’s… not really a priority. Does that make sense, Doctor?
DOCTOR: It does, Ms. Swaby. Family history can be difficult to trace. Now, are you currently taking any other medications besides the one for your hypertension?
PATIENT: Oh, good question. Let me see… I do take a multivitamin, just a standard one, nothing special. And sometimes, when my joints ache, I take ibuprofen. But that's only when needed, not regularly. That's it, I think. Just the multivitamin and the occasional ibuprofen. I am quite careful about taking too many medications, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Swaby. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don't. I haven't ever experienced any allergic reactions. I can eat pretty much anything, and I haven't had any trouble with medications, as far as I can recall. My husband always double-checks everything, just to be safe, though. He’s very cautious.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Now, Ms. Swaby, I would like to perform a brief physical examination if you’re comfortable with that. It will involve checking your vital signs – your blood pressure, pulse, and temperature – as well as a neurological examination to assess your speech, balance, and reflexes. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly alright. I'm happy to cooperate in any way that will help. I understand it's important to get to the bottom of things. I trust your judgement completely. Please, go ahead.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Swaby, your blood pressure is a bit elevated, but not alarmingly so. Now, I'm going to ask you to follow my finger with your eyes. They appear smooth and coordinated. Next, I’d like you to say “ah” for as long as you can. The quality of your voice is normal, but I do notice a slight slurring on the longer vowels. Now, could you please tell me the date and where we are today?
PATIENT: Oh, um… the date is… August 2nd, isn't it? 2025, I believe. And we are… at your clinic, Doctor. It’s a lovely clinic, by the way. Very clean and bright. Though, to be honest, it’s all a bit… blurry. I’m trying to focus, but my memory… it isn't what it used to be. I apologize if I’m being difficult.
DOCTOR: You’re not being difficult at all, Ms. Swaby. The date is correct, and you correctly identified your location. Now, I’d like to test your balance. Could you please stand up and walk a few steps for me?
PATIENT: Alright, here I go. There we go. I'm a little unsteady, I think. My balance hasn't been great lately, to be honest. It’s just a little… off. Is that alright, Doctor? Should I stop?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s alright. It’s good you noticed the unsteadiness. I observe a slight imbalance and some mild coordination issues during your walk. Now, let's check your reflexes. Please sit back down. Your reflexes are normal and symmetrical. Based on these initial findings – the elevated blood pressure, slight slurring of speech, mild coordination issues, and occasional blurry vision – I'd like to order some further testing. Specifically, I want to order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, a thyroid-stimulating hormone test, and a brain MRI. The MRI will help us rule out any structural abnormalities.
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That sounds… extensive, Doctor. Is everything alright? Is it something serious? The MRI sounds a bit… scary, to be honest. I've never had one before. But if it's necessary, then I suppose I'll do it. I just hope it doesn't take too long. And I hope it’s not too expensive. I trust your judgement, Doctor, but I’m a little anxious. What exactly are we looking for with all these tests?
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety, Ms. Swaby, and it’s perfectly reasonable to feel this way. We are conducting these tests to gather more information and rule out various possibilities. The elevated blood pressure, while not dramatically high, needs to be investigated. The speech slurring and coordination issues, along with the occasional blurry vision, could indicate a number of things – from a vitamin deficiency to a neurological issue. The MRI will allow us to visualize your brain and identify any potential structural problems, such as a stroke, tumor, or multiple sclerosis. The tests will also help us rule out less serious possibilities, such as a thyroid problem or a vitamin deficiency. It’s better to be thorough and identify the cause of your symptoms accurately. Regarding the MRI, it’s a non-invasive procedure. You will lie on a table inside a large machine that uses magnetic fields and radio waves to create detailed images of your brain. It’s relatively painless, but it can be a bit noisy. The procedure usually takes about 30-60 minutes. I will write a referral for the MRI and the blood tests. I will also discuss the costs with the billing department and let you know if there are any potential out-of-pocket expenses. We can also explore options for financial assistance if needed. In the meantime, I recommend you avoid any strenuous activities and get plenty of rest. Do you have any other questions or concerns at this time?
PATIENT: Oh, that… that's a lot to take in, Doctor. Multiple sclerosis… that sounds very serious. But you said we’re ruling things out, so I suppose that’s good. I think… I think I understand. The tests are to get a clearer picture. And I appreciate you explaining everything so thoroughly. I'm a little worried about the MRI, to be honest. I've heard they can be quite claustrophobic. Is it possible to… take something to calm my nerves beforehand? And… what if something is found? What happens then? I'm sorry for asking so many questions. I just… I just want to know what's going on. And I want to be prepared.
DOCTOR: You are absolutely right to ask questions, Ms. Swaby. It's important to be informed and prepared. There is no such thing as asking too many questions when it comes to your health. Yes, the MRI can be claustrophobic for some people. We can certainly discuss options for managing that anxiety. We can prescribe an anti-anxiety medication to take before the procedure. Alternatively, some facilities offer open MRIs, which have a wider opening and may be less confining. We can also arrange for you to have the procedure in a more comfortable setting if that would help. Please let the technician know when you schedule the appointment if you have any concerns about claustrophobia. Regarding what happens if something is found, that will depend on the nature of the findings. If we find any abnormalities, we will consult with a neurologist for further evaluation and treatment recommendations. The treatment options will vary depending on the diagnosis. We will discuss all of the options with you in detail and help you make an informed decision about your care. In the meantime, I want to reassure you that we are taking a proactive approach to investigate your symptoms. We will work together to get to the bottom of this and develop a plan to improve your health. Before we conclude, do you have any allergies to contrast dye?
PATIENT: Oh, that's… reassuring to hear, Doctor. Thank you. I appreciate your patience and understanding. Contrast dye… I don’t think so. I’ve never had any dye injected before, so I wouldn’t know. My husband usually handles all the medical questions. He’s much better at remembering these things. I suppose it’s best to err on the side of caution and say I might be allergic? Just in case? I wouldn’t want to have a reaction during the MRI. Is it common to have a reaction to the dye? And… what would happen if I did? I’m sorry to keep asking questions, but it’s just making me a little anxious. I trust you, Doctor, but I like to be prepared.
DOCTOR: You are right to be cautious, Ms. Swaby, and it's perfectly reasonable to be anxious. It’s always best to err on the side of safety. We will document a potential allergy to contrast dye. Reactions to contrast dye are uncommon, but they can occur. Mild reactions, such as itching, hives, or flushing, are relatively common and can be treated with antihistamines. More severe reactions, such as difficulty breathing or anaphylaxis, are rare but require immediate medical attention. To minimize the risk of a reaction, we will ask you a series of questions before the procedure to assess your risk factors. We will also have emergency medications readily available in case of a reaction. The technician will monitor you closely throughout the procedure. I will also write a prescription for an antihistamine to take before the MRI as a preventative measure. Now, to summarise, I have ordered a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, a TSH test, and a brain MRI. I have also written a prescription for an antihistamine and documented a potential allergy to contrast dye. We have discussed the potential risks and benefits of the MRI and options for managing your anxiety. Do you have any other questions or concerns at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think… I think that covers everything, Doctor. You've been very thorough and patient with me. I really appreciate it. I suppose… all that’s left to do is schedule the MRI and take the antihistamine. I’ll let my husband handle the scheduling; he’s much better at these things. And I’ll make sure he knows to mention my concerns about claustrophobia. Thank you again, Doctor Delacour. I feel a little less anxious now, knowing that we have a plan.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Swaby. I’m glad I could help. Please don’t hesitate to contact my office if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. I wish you all the best, and I look forward to discussing the results of your tests with you soon.
