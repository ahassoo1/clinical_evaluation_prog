DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. McNabb. Or… is it Nicoletta?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Gorga. Nicoletta is just fine, please. It’s… a pleasure to meet you. My goodness, you look so young for a doctor!
DOCTOR: Thank you, Nicoletta. Well, let's get down to it, shall we?
PATIENT: Yes, please. That’s why I’m here, isn’t it? I just… well, I feel like I need a bit of a… a jumpstart. Everything feels a little… slow, you know? Not bad, just… not how it used to be.
DOCTOR: Slow… can you elaborate on that a little?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Elaborate… yes. Well, it's hard to explain. I used to have so much energy for my garden, for my grandchildren… Now, everything takes more effort. Getting up in the morning, even. It's not pain, mind you. Just… a lack of… pep. And I forget little things, sometimes. Not important things, thankfully, but… names, where I put my glasses… things like that.
DOCTOR: Okay, a general sense of fatigue and some mild forgetfulness… how long has this been going on, roughly?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s a good question. It feels like… a while now. Maybe six months, perhaps? It started gradually, you see. I thought it was just getting older, truthfully. But it’s not really… improving, is it? It feels like it’s getting… a little bit worse, slowly.
DOCTOR: Alright, six months... Any other symptoms alongside the fatigue and memory issues?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Well, I haven’t been sleeping as well lately. I wake up a couple of times a night, just… to use the restroom, usually. And I’ve noticed my appetite isn’t quite what it used to be. Not that I don’t eat, just… not as much. And… oh! I get cold easily now. Even when the house is warm. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Okay, disturbed sleep, decreased appetite, and feeling cold… Do you have any pain anywhere?
PATIENT: No, no pain, thankfully. Not really. My joints might ache a little sometimes, after gardening, but that’s just old age, I suppose. Nothing… serious. I used to be able to work in the garden all day! Now, just a few hours is enough to tire me out.
DOCTOR: Alright. And, just to cover the basics, any history of… well, significant medical problems?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me see… I had pneumonia when I was quite young, a long time ago. And I had my gallbladder out, maybe twenty years ago now? Apart from that… nothing much, really. I’ve always been a pretty healthy woman, or so I thought. My husband, God rest his soul, had some heart trouble, but that wouldn’t be… relevant, would it?
DOCTOR: No, probably not directly. And any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, no allergies that I know of. I’ve taken all sorts of things over the years, for colds and aches… never had a reaction. I’m a pretty simple woman, Doctor. Not much bothers me. Except, perhaps, this tiredness…
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter ones or vitamins?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Just a little something for my blood pressure. Lisinopril, I think it’s called. And I take a multivitamin every morning. Just the standard one, nothing fancy. I suppose I could tell you the exact dosage if you like, but I have it written down at home, you see. It’s easier to remember that way.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril and a multivitamin… Now, if you don’t mind, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a better sense of things. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. Please, go ahead. I’m ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you could just hop up on the table for me… First, let’s check your blood pressure and pulse. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, 148 over 82. And your pulse is 78, regular. Now, let’s listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are normal, though a little distant. Lungs are clear, but a few scattered rhonchi… not too concerning. Now, let's take a look at your thyroid… Thyroid feels normal, no nodules or enlargement. Now, let's just check your reflexes… Reflexes are a bit diminished, but not significantly. Alright, that's a quick overview.
PATIENT: Oh, my. That was… thorough. Is that… normal? Diminished reflexes, you said? Is that a sign of… something? I haven’t felt particularly clumsy, if that helps. Just… tired, mostly.
DOCTOR: Diminished reflexes can be normal for your age, Nicoletta, but it’s something we’ll want to keep an eye on. It could indicate some mild nerve changes, which are also common with age. It’s nothing to panic about, but it’s good to know. Now, based on what you’ve told me and the quick exam, it sounds like you might be experiencing some general fatigue, possibly related to a mild vitamin deficiency, age-related changes, or, less likely, an underlying thyroid issue. I’d like to order a complete blood count, a thyroid panel, and a vitamin D level to get a clearer picture. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. A complete blood count, thyroid panel, and vitamin D… I’ll remember that. I do hope it's nothing too serious. I just want to feel like myself again, you know? To have the energy to enjoy my garden and my grandchildren. When do we get those tests done?
DOCTOR: Alright, the lab is just down the hall. Here’s the order. They'll need to draw some blood. It should take about fifteen minutes, maybe twenty. Once we have the results, we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. It usually takes a few days for the results to come back. In the meantime, try to get some gentle exercise, if you can, and eat a balanced diet. And please, try not to worry too much. We’ll get to the bottom of this. Now, do you have any questions for me before you head to the lab?
PATIENT: Oh, that's very kind of you, Doctor. Gentle exercise... yes, I can manage that. Perhaps a little weeding in the garden, if the weather is nice. And I’ll try not to worry. It's just… hard sometimes. Just one question, if you don’t mind. Will these tests… will they be painful? I’m not terribly fond of needles, you see.
DOCTOR: It's a very common question, Nicoletta. It’s a little pinch, that’s all. Most people barely feel it. The phlebotomist – the person drawing the blood – is very skilled and gentle. They'll use a small needle, and it's usually over very quickly. If you’re anxious, just let them know, and they can try to distract you or take things slowly. Really, it’s not as bad as you might think. I promise. Now, do you think you're able to go down to the lab now?
PATIENT: Yes, I… I think so. A little pinch, you say? Alright. A little pinch. I can handle a little pinch. Thank you, Doctor Gorga. You’ve been very kind and reassuring. I appreciate it. I’ll go down to the lab now. I’ll see you when the results are in?
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely. They’ll let you know how to schedule a follow-up. And don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before then. Take care, Nicoletta.
PATIENT: .
