DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Jezik. I am Dr. Blim. Now, let’s get straight to it. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. It’s…well, it’s my hands. They shake. Been shaking for a bit now, I reckon. Not sure how long, exactly. Time…it slips away, you know? Just figured I should get it looked at before it gets worse.
DOCTOR: "Time slips away," yes, quite. Well, Mr. Jezik, “a bit now” isn't terribly helpful for a medical assessment, is it?
PATIENT: No, I suppose not. Honestly, Doctor, I…it’s been maybe six months? Could be more, could be less. I used to work out at the plant, you see. Water and…wastewater. Lots of pipes and things. Maybe it started then? I don’t rightly remember. It’s not like it happened overnight. Just…gradual. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: Slightly. Gradual onset… Alright. And is this shaking constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Comes and goes, I think. Worse when I’m trying to do something… like buttoning my shirt, or… or holding a cup. Not so bad when I’m just… sitting. It’s a nuisance, mostly. Makes things harder than they need to be.
DOCTOR: “A nuisance.” Right. And have you noticed anything else associated with this shaking?
PATIENT: Hmm… anything else… Now, let me think. My wife… well, my ex-wife… she used to say I was more clumsy than usual. Dropping things. But we didn’t get along too well towards the end, so I figured she was just… noticing things to complain about. I don't know if that's related. And… maybe I’ve been a little more tired lately? Hard to say. Old age, probably.
DOCTOR: "Old age," of course. And have you experienced any changes in your balance?
PATIENT: Balance… now that you mention it… I think I stumbled a couple of times recently. Nothing major, just a little wobble. I thought it was the rug in the living room, to be honest. My daughter keeps telling me I need to get rid of it. Says it's a tripping hazard. Perhaps she was right… I hadn't really connected it to… this.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, Mr. Jezik, let's discuss your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any conditions previously?
PATIENT: Not that I recall, Doctor. Nothing serious, anyway. A bad back when I was younger, lifting pipes at the plant. That's about it. I’m not one for doctors, never have been. Figured I could handle most things myself. Besides, I don’t have any insurance, so… avoided going if I could.
DOCTOR: “Avoided going if I could.” I see. Any surgeries?
PATIENT: Nope. Never had surgery. Don't like the idea of someone poking around inside me. No thank you. Just the back trouble, that's all. Used to take some pills for it, years ago. Can’t remember what they were called now. Something… blue, maybe? Doesn’t matter now, it doesn’t bother me much anymore.
DOCTOR: Very well. And what about your family?
PATIENT: Family… my father… he was Czech, came over here after the war. Strong man, worked in a factory. My mother… she died when I was young, from… something. Can't rightly recall what it was. As for any family illnesses… not that I know of. No one talked much about that sort of thing. We weren’t a close family, not really. Lots of keeping to ourselves.
DOCTOR: Right. And are you currently taking any medications, prescribed or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: Just a little something for my arthritis, sometimes. When it flares up. Nothing regular, though. Just ibuprofen, I think. The over-the-counter stuff. Like I said, I don't take much. Never really needed to. And honestly, Doctor, it all blurs together after a while. I get confused, remembering what I’ve taken and when. It’s probably better if you don’t ask about that. It'll just be a guess.
DOCTOR: I require accurate information, Mr. Jezik. Now, let’s proceed with a brief physical examination. Please extend your arms.
PATIENT: Alright, alright. Just… be gentle, please. These old bones aren't what they used to be. It’s plain to see, isn't it? The shaking… it's worse when I try to hold still. Try not to make a fuss about it. I get embarrassed, you know.
DOCTOR: Marked resting tremor in both upper extremities, more pronounced on the right. Mild rigidity present. Examination of lower extremities next. No significant abnormalities noted in lower extremities. Reflexes are diminished but symmetrical. Gait assessment to follow. Bradykinesia observed during gait; shuffling steps, reduced arm swing.
PATIENT: See? Not so good, is it? I haven't been moving around much lately… figured it was just old age. Is it bad, Doctor? Is it really bad? I'd rather just… go home, if you don't mind. This is making me nervous. .
DOCTOR: Mr. Jezik, based on the clinical presentation and examination findings, I suspect you may be experiencing early stages of Parkinson’s disease. However, to confirm this diagnosis and rule out other potential causes, I will need to order some imaging studies and laboratory tests. I’m referring you to a neurologist for specialized evaluation. Do you understand?
