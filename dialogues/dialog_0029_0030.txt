DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Purtee. I'm Dr. Chora. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it's a bit embarrassing, honestly. I've noticed a change in how I smell, my body odor. It's...different than usual. I can't quite put my finger on it, but it's enough that I noticed it and it's making me a little worried.
DOCTOR: Okay. I understand. It's good you brought it up – it's always better to address these things. It is unusual to notice a change in body odor, so it’s reasonable to want to look into it. Can you describe what “different” means?
PATIENT: Hmm... okay, let me think. It's not bad, exactly. It's just...sweeter, maybe? And a little bit stronger than it used to be, even after a shower. Usually, I don’t smell much of anything at all, but now I can definitely tell. It's not like a rotten smell or anything, just...not me. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes sense. Sweeter and stronger, even after showering… Alright. And how long have you noticed this change?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see... I'd say about three weeks, maybe a little longer? It started gradually, so it's hard to pinpoint exactly. I thought it was just something with the soap at first, but it’s still happening even after I switched brands. I noticed it consistently around the time that heatwave hit, though.
DOCTOR: Okay, three weeks, coinciding with the heatwave… That’s helpful. Have you noticed any other changes alongside this?
PATIENT: Hmm... now that you mention it, yes. I've been a little more tired than usual, even though I'm sleeping okay. And I think I'm sweating more overall, not just the smell change. Just... generally warmer, even when I don’t feel like I’m doing a lot. Is that important?
DOCTOR: Yes, that is important. Increased sweating and fatigue along with the change in body odor… Okay. Let's go through a quick review of your medical history. Do you have any known medical conditions, like diabetes, kidney problems, or thyroid issues?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I had my gallbladder out about ten years ago, and I had a bad bout of the flu last winter, but nothing major. I've had the usual check-ups, and the doctor always said I was healthy as a horse. I have Medicare, so they keep a pretty close eye on things. I don’t take any regular medications, either.
DOCTOR: Alright, no major medical history, no medications… Good. And any family history of similar issues?
PATIENT: Let me think… My mother had some issues with her thyroid when she was older, but I don’t know the specifics. She passed away a few years ago, and we never really talked about her medical stuff much. My father was healthy as an ox until the very end, though. He didn't really have any problems with smells or sweating, that I remember. He was a farmer, always out in the sun.
DOCTOR: Okay. Thyroid issues in the family, that’s something to keep in mind. Now, a few lifestyle questions. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, sir. Never touched a cigarette in my life. I used to have a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, but I stopped a couple of years ago. Didn’t like how it made me feel. And definitely no drugs. I’m a floor layer, you know? Gotta have a clear head for that kind of work! It's physically demanding.
DOCTOR: Alright, good. No smoking, minimal alcohol, no drugs. Physically demanding work… Okay. And are you experiencing any other symptoms at all?
PATIENT: Let me see... well, I've been a little bit thirsty lately, more so than usual. And I think I'm a little more irritable than normal, snapping at folks for no good reason. My ex-husband says I’m always irritable, but he would say that. But yes, definitely thirstier and a little quicker to get annoyed. Does that count?
DOCTOR: Yes, that counts. Thirst and irritability, along with the other symptoms… Okay. I'd like to do a quick physical exam now, if that’s alright with you. I'll check your vital signs – temperature, pulse, blood pressure – and listen to your heart and lungs. I also want to take a look at your skin.
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgment. I just want to figure out what's going on. I’m a little worried, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's start with your vital signs. Blood pressure is 130/80, pulse is 88, temperature is 98.6, which are all within normal limits. Heart sounds are regular, lungs are clear. Skin looks normal, no rashes or unusual discoloration. Now, let’s check your thyroid gland. Your thyroid feels slightly enlarged, but not dramatically so. It’s tender to the touch. Now, I'm going to order some blood work. We need to check your thyroid hormone levels, blood sugar, and kidney function. We'll also do a complete blood count, just to be thorough.
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds…serious. Enlarged and tender? Is that bad? I thought my thyroid was supposed to be small and not noticeable. What does that mean, Doctor? The blood work sounds good, though. I just... I’m a little scared now, if I’m honest.
DOCTOR: It’s good you’re asking questions, Ms. Purtee. It can be concerning, but we're just gathering information right now. An enlarged thyroid can have several causes, and it doesn’t automatically mean anything serious. Tenderness can indicate inflammation, but again, many things can cause that. The blood work will give us a much clearer picture. We'll check for hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism – that's when the thyroid is overactive or underactive, respectively. We'll also rule out any other potential causes for your symptoms. It's important to remember we haven't made any definitive diagnosis yet. We're just taking steps to figure things out. The lab results should be back in a couple of days. I'll have my nurse contact you as soon as we have them. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No, I think... I think I understand. Just gathering information. A couple of days, okay. No, I don't think I have any questions right now. I’ll just... wait for the results, I guess. Thank you, Doctor Chora. I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly. It makes me feel a little better, honestly. .
