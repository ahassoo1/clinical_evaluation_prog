DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Segretto. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Eriberto Bakan. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Bakaan, did you say? Right. Well, it’s this… business with the, uh… going to the little boy's room. Too much, you see? Just too much. It's been going on for a bit now. Not sure how long, honestly. Things… blur these days. My wife keeps mentioning it, though. She's got a good memory, that one.
DOCTOR: Yes, Bakan. And thank you for clarifying. It sounds like you've been experiencing increased urinary frequency, or needing to urinate more often than usual. And it’s good you have a wife who is observant; sometimes it is difficult to recall precise timelines. You mentioned it’s been going on for “a bit now”. Could you perhaps give me a rough estimate?
PATIENT: Rough… hmm. Well, let’s see. After the harvest, I think. Maybe… six months? Seven? Hard to say with all the chores around the farm. It’s always something needing doing, you know? The tomatoes were good this year, though. Real good. But the bathroom… that's been a bother all that time. It wakes me up at night, too. A couple of times. More than it used to. It’s just… inconvenient, really. Not life-threatening.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds disruptive, certainly. And waking you at night is concerning. So, roughly six to seven months of increased frequency and nocturia – that’s the medical term for needing to urinate at night. Has anything else changed alongside this, Mr. Segretto?
PATIENT: Noct… what now? Doctor, I just told you, I’m not one for fancy words. Just… going to the bathroom a lot. As for else… well, my knees ache more, I suppose. But they always ache. Farming's hard on the body. And I'm a bit more… tired, maybe? But that's probably just getting old. I haven’t noticed anything else particularly. No pain, no fever, no… well, you know. Nothing alarming. Just the frequent trips. It’s embarrassing, really. A man shouldn’t have to bother a doctor for this.
DOCTOR: Nocturia simply means needing to urinate at night, Mr. Segretto. I apologize for using medical terminology without clarifying. It's perfectly alright to ask me to explain anything. And please, don’t feel embarrassed at all. It's my job to address all concerns, regardless of how they may seem. You mentioned increased knee pain and fatigue. Is the fatigue constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Constant, I'd say. Well, not all the time. But most of the time. I used to be able to put in a full day of work, no problem. Now? I need a nap in the afternoon. And my wife does more around the farm than she used to. She doesn’t complain, bless her heart, but I see it. She's a strong woman, but even she gets tired. It’s just… slowing down, I suppose. Everything slows down eventually. Like an old tractor. You can fix it up, but it's never quite the same. And the bathroom thing… that just adds to it, you know? Makes everything more… difficult.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. It sounds like you’re experiencing a gradual decline in your energy levels, alongside the bothersome urinary frequency. Now, Mr. Segretto, let’s talk a bit more about the urination itself. Besides frequency, have you noticed any difficulty starting to urinate?
PATIENT: Difficulty starting… hmm. Sometimes, it takes a moment. Just a moment. Not a struggle, not a pain. Just… a little hesitation. Like the water hose needs a bit of priming, you know? Then it flows alright. Perfectly alright. But it doesn't always start right away. It’s not every time, mind you. Just… sometimes. And I don’t push, I wait. Don’t want to strain anything. My wife says I worry too much. She says it's probably just age. But a man likes to be… regular, you know? Proper.
DOCTOR: I understand. That “hesitation” is helpful information. And you're right to be cautious. Have you noticed any change in the strength of the stream?
PATIENT: Strength? Well… it’s not like a fire hose anymore, that’s for sure. Weaker, I suppose. Not a trickle, mind you, but not as… powerful as it used to be. I don't know if that's the bathroom, or just getting old. Things… deflate, you know? Like a balloon. I don’t push, though. Never push. My wife… she worries about my prostate. Says her uncle had trouble with his prostate. But I haven't asked any questions. A man doesn't like to talk about… those things. It's embarrassing.
DOCTOR: I completely understand your hesitation to discuss those things. It’s quite common. It sounds like you've already anticipated some possible causes. Now, I would like to do a very simple, non-invasive test. It simply involves urinating into this device , and it measures the flow rate and volume. This can give us some objective information and help determine the next steps. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: A machine? You want me to… urinate into a machine? Well, I don’t know, Doctor. Seems a bit… impersonal. And what does it do with the information? Does it send it to the government? My wife would be furious. I don't trust these newfangled gadgets. A good doctor should be able to tell just by… listening. Like they used to. But… If you think it's necessary… I suppose I can try. But don't expect miracles. And promise me you won't send it to the government.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Segretto. I understand your concerns completely. This device doesn't send any information anywhere, I assure you. It's simply a tool to help me understand the flow of urine, and it stays right here in the clinic. It doesn’t involve any needles or discomfort; it's just like urinating normally, but into a special container. It’s completely private and confidential, and it will give us objective information that can help guide our next steps. I wouldn't suggest it if I didn’t think it would be helpful, and I respect your concerns about privacy entirely. Would you like me to explain the test in more detail?
PATIENT: Well, alright. If you promise me it doesn't send anything to the government… and it’s just a normal… container. You just want to see how fast it goes, right? Like a little race? My wife always said I was good at anything involving… precision. Alright, alright. Lead the way. But I’m warning you, Doctor, I’m not promising any record-breaking performances. Things aren’t what they used to be. And keep it private, you hear? A man’s dignity is at stake. Now, where is this… container?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Segretto. Complete privacy is assured. The device is very straightforward. I've left detailed instructions on the toilet lid, but please don't hesitate to call me if you have any questions. Simply urinate as you normally would, and the device will measure the flow rate and volume. It will take just a few minutes. I'll be right outside when you are finished. Take your time, and please relax. We're simply gathering information to help you feel better. And don't worry about any records – we're not looking for athletes here. Would you please let me know when you are finished?
