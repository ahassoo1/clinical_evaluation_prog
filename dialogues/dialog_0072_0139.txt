DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Shanor. I'm Dr. Hembrey. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. I... need check for referee. For sports. They want me to be sure I'm… fit. For whistle. Is fitness test, yes? I want quick, if possible.
DOCTOR: A referee physical, you say?
PATIENT: Yes. Exactly. I do basketball mostly, but sometimes… soccer. They need paper say I’m okay to run, see good, everything. Is… important for job. I no want slow things down.
DOCTOR: I understand. So this is a sports physical for refereeing, primarily basketball but occasionally soccer. And you’d like to get this completed as efficiently as possible. Before we proceed with the examination, I need to gather some information to ensure a thorough assessment. Let’s start with your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions – anything at all, such as asthma, heart problems, diabetes, or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think. Nothing… serious. When I was young, maybe some… cold, bad cough. Nothing doctor keep me long. My wife… she was sick, but… that was different. I don't have those problems. No asthma, no heart... trouble. I think. Is blood pressure okay? I no check myself.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, no significant medical history that you are aware of. We will certainly check your blood pressure during the exam. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No surgery. No hospital… except when wife… very sick. That was… long time ago. I no need hospital for me. Just… small things, like cut when I work. Refractory… is hot work. Sometimes burn. But nothing big.
DOCTOR: I understand. No personal history of surgery or hospitalization. Now, let's talk about your family. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family – heart disease, diabetes, cancer, or anything else that you are aware of?
PATIENT: My father… he had old man things. Weak heart, I think. He sit a lot. Not run like me. Mother… she was strong, healthy. No… big sickness. Grandparents… I no know them very well. They lived far away. So… maybe heart? Just father. Nothing else I remember.
DOCTOR: Okay. A family history of heart issues on your father’s side. And finally, before we begin the physical examination, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No medicine. Not now. I… sometimes take something for muscle pain, when I work very hard. But not all the time. Just… when I really need. Is… like ibuprofen, maybe? I buy at store. Small bottle. Nothing special.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Shanor. So, no regular medications, occasional ibuprofen for muscle pain. And you have a history of a weak heart on your father’s side. Let’s proceed with the physical exam. I’m going to check your vital signs – blood pressure, pulse, respiration rate, and temperature – and then listen to your heart and lungs, check your reflexes, and do a basic musculoskeletal assessment. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that's okay. Quick is good, Doctor. Let's get it done. I have things to do. Basketball season start soon.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Please have a seat on the examination table. We’ll start with your blood pressure. Relax your arm, please. Blood pressure is 138/84. Pulse is 72 and regular. Temperature is 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit. Respiration rate is 16 breaths per minute. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs auscultated. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Now, can you take a deep breath and exhale slowly?
PATIENT: Okay, deep breath… Like this? Everything okay so far? Is good? Can I stand up now? I feel little funny sitting.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's perfect. Everything sounds good so far. You can sit up when you're ready. I just want to check your reflexes now. Reflexes are 2+ and equal bilaterally. Now, I’m going to assess your musculoskeletal system. Can you please bend forward and touch your toes?
PATIENT: Oof… like this? Is little tight. Refractory work… lots of bending, heavy lifting. Not easy on back. Is that okay? Still okay?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's fine. A little stiffness, as you mentioned. I can see some muscle tightness. Now, can you please walk a few steps for me, heel-to-toe?
PATIENT: Like this? Is… strange walking like this. I no walk like this normal. I run, yes. Fast. Not… slow like this. Everything okay? Is that enough? I feel… silly.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's sufficient. No significant instability observed. Overall, your musculoskeletal exam reveals some expected tightness from your work, but no acute concerns. I’d like to get a basic EKG just to get a baseline reading, given your father’s history of heart issues. It’s a quick and painless procedure. Would you be amenable to that?
PATIENT: EKG? Is… needle? Is pain? I no like needle. Just… check everything is okay, yes? No need… poke? Can we just… finish now? I really need to go. Basketball practice start soon. I promise I'm fit. I run every day!
DOCTOR: No, Mr. Shanor, an EKG does not involve a needle. It’s a simple test where we place small adhesive patches on your chest, arms, and legs to measure your heart’s electrical activity. It’s completely painless. However, given your family history and to ensure your complete safety for competitive refereeing, I strongly recommend it. It's a standard precaution, and it takes only a few minutes. I understand you're eager to get to practice, but this will provide valuable information and give you peace of mind. I will document your reluctance, but I truly believe it’s in your best interest. If you decline, I will have to note a limitation in the assessment and may recommend you see a cardiologist for a more thorough evaluation before participating in strenuous activity. What would you prefer?
PATIENT: Okay, okay. Fine. Just… quick, yes? No long time. Just… patches. And no poking. You promise? I no want wait. Basketball… very important. Just… get it done quickly. And tell me when is okay. No need tell me about… electricity. I no understand. Just… is okay?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Shanor. Quick and painless, I promise. No needles, no poking. We'll just place the patches, run the test, and I’ll let you know the results as soon as I have them. Please lie back on the examination table, and I’ll explain as I go. We’re just monitoring your heart’s rhythm, that’s all.
