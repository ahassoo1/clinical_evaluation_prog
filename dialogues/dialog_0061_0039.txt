DOCTOR: Bula and good morning, Mr. Bohnett. It's lovely to meet you. I'm Dr. Kimm. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, good morning to you too, Doctor. It's nice to meet you as well. My regular doctor, Doctor Evans, he… well, he retired. And the new folks sent a notice about this high cholesterol thing. Said I needed to come in and talk about it. Never had trouble with that before, so I'm a little confused, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It can be unsettling when things change, and you’re getting a new notice about something you haven’t dealt with before. So, Doctor Evans retired – I’m sorry to hear that, but glad you're following up. And this is regarding a high cholesterol result?
PATIENT: Yes, that's right. A blood test, I think. They just sent a letter saying my numbers were… high. I don't really understand what that means, exactly. I eat pretty well, I always have. Lots of fish, vegetables… not much of that fast food stuff. So it surprised me. Do you need me to tell you more about what I eat?
DOCTOR: It's good you're proactive about your health, and that you eat a healthy diet. That’s very helpful information. And yes, please, tell me a little more about what a typical day of eating looks like for you. Just so I get a better picture. Also, have you had any changes in your weight recently?
PATIENT: Well, let me think. Breakfast is usually oatmeal with some berries, and maybe a little bit of honey. Lunch is often a sandwich – turkey or ham, with lettuce and tomato. And dinner… well, my daughter usually brings me something nice. She worries about me, you know? Fish is common, like you said, or chicken. And a side of vegetables. I don't eat a lot at once, if that makes sense. As for weight… not really. I think I’ve actually lost a pound or two over the last year. It's hard to keep track, to be honest. I'm 88 years old, things change!
DOCTOR: That sounds like a very balanced diet, Mr. Bohnett. And it's wonderful that your daughter looks after you so well. Losing a pound or two isn't usually a major concern at your age, but good to know. Now, aside from the cholesterol notice, have you been feeling any different lately?
PATIENT: No, not really. I feel… well, I feel like an 88-year-old! A little creaky in the mornings, you know? But nothing major. No chest pain, no shortness of breath, no dizziness… just the usual aches and pains. I still get around pretty well, walk to the store most days, though not as far as I used to. And I sleep alright, usually. Maybe a little trouble getting to sleep sometimes, but nothing a warm glass of milk can't fix.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear. It sounds like you're generally quite healthy for your age. Now, let's talk a little bit about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any other health conditions – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Let me think… Doctor Evans checked me over every year, regular check-ups. He said my blood pressure was a little high once, a long time ago, but he put me on a little pill for it, and that seemed to do the trick. I took it for a few years, and then he said it was alright to stop. Nothing else, really. No diabetes, no heart problems… just the usual old-age stuff. I had the flu a couple of times, but who hasn’t?
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of slightly elevated blood pressure in the past, which was managed with medication and then discontinued. That's good information. And no history of diabetes or heart problems. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Now that you mention it… I had my gallbladder out, oh, must be forty years ago now. And I broke my wrist when I was younger, fell off a ladder while picking apples. But that’s it, really. Nothing major in recent years. It was a long time ago, those surgeries. They did a good job, though! Never had any trouble with them afterwards.
DOCTOR: Alright, gallbladder removal and a broken wrist in the past. Good to know. Now, thinking about your family… are there any health conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, stroke, or high cholesterol?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. My mother, she had a weak heart, I think. She passed away when she was in her seventies. And my father… he had strokes, I believe. Not sure exactly what kind, it was a long time ago. And my sister, she had high blood pressure, like me. But that's about all I can remember, honestly. We weren’t a family that talked much about health problems.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a family history of heart problems in your mother, stroke in your father, and high blood pressure in your sister. That's helpful to know. Now, are you currently taking any medications, besides the blood pressure pill you used to take?
PATIENT: No, not at all. Just a little vitamin D in the winter, the doctor said I wasn't getting enough sunshine. But that's it. I don't like taking pills if I can avoid it. Always worried about side effects, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, just vitamin D occasionally. And no known allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: No, no allergies that I'm aware of. I've never had a bad reaction to anything, thankfully. I used to help my wife with her gardening, and I’ve touched all sorts of plants, never had any trouble with poison ivy or anything like that either.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. That's all good. Now, before we move on to a quick physical exam, are there any other concerns you’d like to discuss today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Just this cholesterol thing, really. It’s a little worrying, but I’m glad I came in to talk about it. I appreciate you asking so many questions, Doctor. It makes me feel like you’re really listening.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Bohnett. I’m glad you came in as well. It’s always best to get things checked out. Now, if you don’t mind, I’d like to do a quick physical exam – just listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and feel your abdomen. It shouldn't take long. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. I trust your judgment.
DOCTOR: Okay, great. Take a nice, deep breath in… and out… Good. Your heart sounds are regular, but I do hear a slight murmur. It’s not necessarily concerning, especially given your age, but we'll want to keep an eye on it. Now, take some deep breaths for me… in… and out… Your lungs sound clear. Your blood pressure today is 142 over 88. That’s a little elevated, but not drastically so. And your abdomen is soft, no tenderness. Do you feel any pain when I press here?
PATIENT: No, that doesn't hurt. Just feels like… a gentle press. Like you said, nothing major. I haven't had any stomach trouble in years. Is that murmur something I should be worried about? My mother had a bad heart, you know.
DOCTOR: It's understandable to be concerned, especially with your mother's history. The murmur is a sound that indicates some turbulence in the blood flow, but it’s very common in older adults. It doesn’t necessarily mean there’s anything seriously wrong. We’ll want to get an EKG – that’s a simple test to check your heart’s electrical activity – just to be sure. And I'd also like to order a lipid panel, which will give us a detailed breakdown of your cholesterol levels. We'll also repeat a blood pressure check in a few weeks, after you’ve had a chance to relax a bit more. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds sensible. Whatever tests you think are best, Doctor. An EKG and the cholesterol test… alright. And checking my blood pressure again later… yes. I’m happy to do whatever you recommend. Will these tests tell me if I need to take any pills? Because, as I said, I don’t really like taking them.
DOCTOR: That's a fair question, Mr. Bohnett. The tests will give us a clearer picture of your overall heart health. Depending on the results, we may discuss lifestyle changes – things like diet and exercise – as the first step. If those aren’t enough, we might consider medication, but that’s something we would discuss thoroughly first. We’ll weigh the risks and benefits together. I’m going to order these tests now. The lab is just down the hall. They’ll be expecting you. And the nurse will give you instructions on how to schedule a follow-up appointment. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly good. The lab down the hall… alright. And the nurse will help me with the appointment. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve put my mind at ease a little, knowing we’re getting things checked out. I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything so clearly.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Bohnett. I’m glad I could help. We’ll get these tests done and go from there. Remember, we’ll work together to make the best decisions for your health. The nurse, Sarah, is just outside. She'll get you checked in with the lab. Do you need any help getting up?
PATIENT: No, thank you, I'm alright. Just a little creaky, as usual. Thank you again, Doctor. I’ll see you at the follow-up appointment. .
DOCTOR: Okay, you take care, Mr. Bohnett. It was lovely meeting you. And don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up.
