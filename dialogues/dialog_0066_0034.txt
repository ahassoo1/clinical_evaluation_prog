DOCTOR: Hi Emileigh, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Condray. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hi, nice to meet you too, Doctor. Um… well, I just moved here. It’s a check-up, I think? My… someone said I should get checked out since I’m new to the area. I don’t really remember all the details, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's perfectly alright. A general check-up is a great idea when you're establishing care somewhere new. And it’s common to not remember every detail. We'll go through everything. Just to start, can you tell me a little bit about what you’ve been feeling lately?
PATIENT: Um… feeling? Everything feels… normal, I guess? I haven’t been sick sick. Maybe a little tired sometimes, but work is… work. I fix things. Machines mostly. Is that what you mean? Like, anything wrong feeling? I don’t think so.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful to know. “Normal” is good! And yes, I mean anything that feels different or unusual for you. Even if it's not a full-blown illness. You mentioned work being… work, and fixing machines. That sounds physically demanding. Do you ever experience any pain or discomfort related to that – your back, shoulders, hands, anything like that?
PATIENT: Oh. Yeah, sometimes my back gets a bit sore. Lots of bending and reaching, you know? And my hands… they get kinda shaky after a long day. Not all the time, though. Just when I’ve been working on something small and tricky for hours. It doesn’t really… stop me from doing things, if that makes sense? It just… feels tired. Does that sound bad?
DOCTOR: No, that doesn’t necessarily sound bad, but it's good you mentioned it. It's common to experience muscle soreness and hand fatigue with that type of work. We should definitely take a closer look at both. Let’s start with your back. Can you describe the soreness?
PATIENT: It’s… kinda a dull ache. It’s not sharp, and it doesn’t come and go fast. It just… is there. Mostly lower back. After I’ve been working all day. And sometimes when I try to lift something heavy, not at work, just… around the house. It doesn't happen every time, but… yeah. It's just… uncomfortable. Does that make sense? I'm not good at explaining things.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly clear, Emileigh. A dull ache in the lower back, especially after prolonged activity or lifting, is a common complaint. We'll want to rule out anything serious, but it sounds like it could be muscle strain. Now, about your hands. You said they get shaky after working on small, tricky things. Is the shaking constant while you're working, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It comes and goes. It's not always shaky, just when I'm really focused on something tiny and need to be really precise. Like, fixing the really small parts in a machine. And it’s not a big shake, more like a… tremor? It’s hard to explain. It doesn’t hurt, it just… makes it harder to hold things steady. And it goes away when I stop working on it for a bit. Like that, but not that bad. Mostly just annoying.
DOCTOR: Okay, a tremor that comes and goes with fine motor tasks and improves with rest. That's good information. To get a better picture of things, could you tell me a little bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: Um… Honestly? I don’t really remember much about it. I know I’ve had the usual kid stuff, chickenpox, maybe measles, but… I haven’t been to a doctor in… a long time. Since I moved away, I guess. And I don’t really remember if I’ve had any… serious illnesses. I’m married, though. Does that matter?
DOCTOR: No, that’s alright, it's common for people to not have all their medical history readily available. Being married doesn’t directly affect your medical care, but it's good to know. So, since you haven't been to a doctor in a while, let’s start with some basic questions. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… I don’t think so. I mean, I haven't noticed anything. My husband usually cooks, and I don’t really pay attention to all the ingredients. He’s a good cook. I don’t think I've ever had a reaction to anything. But… I don’t really know for sure. Does that make sense? It’s probably okay, right?
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies, but you’re unsure. We'll proceed cautiously then. And what about any medications you're currently taking?
PATIENT: No. None. I don't take anything. I haven’t needed to. Just… vitamins sometimes. But my husband buys those. I don’t even know what kind. I really don't take much medicine. I try to stay healthy.
DOCTOR: Okay, no regular medications or vitamins that you are aware of. Good to know. Now, let’s talk about your family history. Do you know if any of your close relatives – parents, siblings, grandparents – have any significant medical conditions, like heart disease, diabetes, or cancer?
PATIENT: Um… my mom… she had… trouble with her heart, I think. When she was older. She had to… go to the hospital a few times. But I don't really know what happened. She passed away a few years ago. And my dad… he was mostly healthy, I think. Just… old age. He didn't really talk about sickness much. I don't really remember if anyone else had anything bad… I don't really know my grandparents very well. I'm sorry, I'm not very helpful.
DOCTOR: You’re being very helpful, Emileigh. It's common to not have a complete family medical history. Knowing about your mother’s heart trouble is good to know. Okay, let’s shift gears a bit. Can you tell me about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle? Um… I work. A lot. I fix machines. And I… I guess I mostly just go to work and come home. My husband and I… we watch TV sometimes. And he likes to garden. I help him sometimes. I don't really… do much else. I don't smoke, and I don't drink much alcohol. Maybe a glass of wine with dinner sometimes. Is that what you mean by lifestyle? It's not very exciting.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright. That gives me a good idea. So, primarily a work-focused lifestyle, no smoking, minimal alcohol. That's good. Now, I'd like to do a brief physical exam. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Yes, okay. That’s fine. Whatever you need to do. Just… let me know if it's going to hurt. I don't really like needles.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I'll explain everything as I go, and we’ll go at your pace. We’ll start by checking your vital signs – your blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. Then I’ll listen to your heart and lungs. After that, I’d like to take a look at your back and hands. I’ll also do a basic neurological exam, just to check your reflexes and coordination. First, let’s check your blood pressure. Just relax your arm, please.
PATIENT: Okay. Is it going to be tight? My husband says my blood pressure is usually okay. He checks it sometimes, because his dad had… problems. I don’t really remember what kind.
DOCTOR: It will be snug, but not painful. And that's good to know your husband checks it. Your blood pressure is 130 over 80. That's a little elevated, but not drastically so. We'll keep an eye on it. Your pulse is 72 and regular. And your temperature is 98.6. Now, let’s listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a few deep breaths for me. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Now, could you please sit up and let me examine your back?
PATIENT: Okay. It doesn’t hurt to sit up, just… everything feels a bit achy. Be careful, it’s a bit sensitive. I think I pulled something at work last week. Lifting a really heavy part… It wasn't very smart.
DOCTOR: Okay, there's some tenderness to the touch in your lower back, and a bit of stiffness when you bend forward. No significant muscle spasm, which is good. It does seem like you may have strained a muscle. Now, let’s take a look at your hands. Could you please hold this object?
PATIENT: Okay. It’s a bit harder to hold when I’m nervous. Does it need to be held tight?
DOCTOR: Okay, I notice a slight tremor in your hand, which seems to be more pronounced when you’re holding something. Your grip strength is good, though. Based on what we've discussed and what I’ve observed during the exam, I suspect you have a mild muscle strain in your lower back and possibly some essential tremor in your hands. However, to rule out other potential causes, I’d like to order a few tests. Would you be okay with getting some bloodwork done?
PATIENT: Bloodwork? I don't really like needles. What are you looking for? Is something seriously wrong? My husband will be really worried… Is it expensive?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Emileigh. Bloodwork is just to help us rule out other possibilities and get a clearer picture of what’s going on. We’ll check your basic inflammatory markers, thyroid function, and vitamin levels. It's a pretty standard set of tests. It's not usually very expensive, especially with your Medicare coverage, but we can check with the billing department to give you an estimate. The tests aren’t meant to indicate something seriously wrong, more of a precaution. Essential tremor itself isn't usually a sign of a serious condition, but it’s good to rule out other causes like thyroid problems. And the bloodwork can help us assess that. Would you like me to explain the tests in more detail?
PATIENT: Okay. Um… yes, please. If you could explain them… that would be good. I just… I don't want anything bad to be wrong. My husband said his dad had trouble with his heart, and… well, I just want to make sure it's nothing like that.
DOCTOR: Certainly. So, the first test is a Complete Blood Count, or CBC. This checks the different types of cells in your blood – red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. It can help us identify if you have any signs of infection or anemia. Then we’ll check your Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate, or ESR, and C-Reactive Protein, or CRP. These are inflammatory markers – they can tell us if there’s any inflammation in your body, which can sometimes be associated with muscle pain. Next, we’ll check your thyroid function – TSH and T4 levels. An underactive thyroid can sometimes cause muscle pain and tremors. Finally, we'll check your Vitamin D and B12 levels. Deficiencies in these vitamins can also contribute to muscle pain and neurological symptoms. These tests are relatively simple and shouldn't take long. And again, they’re just a precaution to help us get a clearer picture of what’s going on. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Yes… I think so. Red cells, inflammation, thyroid… and vitamins. It sounds… complicated. But you said it's just to make sure? And it won't hurt too much? I really don't like needles.
DOCTOR: Exactly, it's just to make sure we have a complete picture. It is a bit complicated, but I'll explain the results to you in detail once we get them. And I understand your anxiety about the needle. It’s a quick pinch, and the phlebotomist is very skilled. We can also use a numbing cream if you’d like, to minimize any discomfort. So, if you're okay with it, I’ll order the bloodwork. It should be ready in a few days. In the meantime, I recommend applying ice to your lower back for 15-20 minutes at a time, several times a day. And try to avoid any strenuous activity that aggravates your pain. Would you like a written copy of these instructions, and the list of tests being ordered?
PATIENT: Yes, please. A written copy would be really helpful. I forget things so easily. And ice… okay, I can do that. My husband usually puts ice packs on my injuries. He's very good at taking care of me. So, you think it's just a muscle strain and maybe… a vitamin thing? Not something serious?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s my initial impression, Emileigh. A mild muscle strain is the most likely cause of your back pain, and the tremor could be related to a vitamin deficiency or an essential tremor. However, we're doing the bloodwork to rule out other possibilities, just to be on the safe side. Here you go. This outlines everything we discussed. I'll also schedule a follow-up appointment for you in a week, once the bloodwork results are back. We can discuss the results and create a more tailored treatment plan at that time. Do you have any other questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s everything. Thank you, Doctor. You explained everything very clearly. And you didn’t make me feel bad about forgetting things. I'll see you next week.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Emileigh. I'm glad I could help. Don't hesitate to call the clinic if you have any concerns before your follow-up appointment. And remember to take it easy, apply the ice, and let me know if anything changes. Have a good week, and I’ll see you then.
