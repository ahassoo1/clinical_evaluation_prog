DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Abdollahi. I'm Dr. Duplichan. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. My… my husband and I, we are thinking about a place for me to live. A… a nice place for older people. He says I need a paper from you, to say I am okay to go there.
DOCTOR: A placement assessment, then. Right. So, they require a physician's statement regarding your overall health status. Understandable. Let's get some information down. To start, can you tell me a little bit about why you and your husband are considering a facility like that?
PATIENT: It is… hard for me to do things now. Like… cleaning. And cooking. My hands… they hurt sometimes. And I get tired. My husband, he is a good man, but he is old too. It is too much for him.
DOCTOR: Okay, so difficulty with activities of daily living – cleaning, cooking – and some hand pain and fatigue. And your husband is finding it difficult to manage as well. I see. When did you start noticing these difficulties?
PATIENT: Hmm… a little at a time. Maybe… six months ago? The hands… they started hurting more then. And I… I forget things. Not big things, but… where I put the keys. Or what I was going to buy at the store. It is… annoying.
DOCTOR: Approximately six months ago, with a gradual onset of hand pain and some memory lapses… more minor forgetfulness, you said?
PATIENT: Yes. Not like… I don't know who I am. Just… small things. Like… I made coffee this morning, but I forgot to put sugar in it. That kind of thing.
DOCTOR: Alright. And aside from the hand pain and the forgetfulness, are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… Sometimes I feel… a little dizzy. Not all the time. When I stand up too fast, maybe. And… my feet… they swell up sometimes. Especially at the end of the day.
DOCTOR: Dizziness upon standing and some swelling in your feet. Okay. Have you noticed any shortness of breath, chest pain, or palpitations associated with the dizziness, or is it just feeling lightheaded?
PATIENT: No, no pain. Just… whoosh. Like the room is spinning. And then it goes away. The feet… they just feel tired and big. Not hurt, just… uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: No chest pain or palpitations with the dizziness, just a sensation of lightheadedness. And the feet swelling is primarily at the end of the day and not accompanied by pain. Let's move on to your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions – high blood pressure, diabetes, arthritis, anything like that?
PATIENT: Let me think… The doctor, many years ago, he said my blood pressure was a little high. He gave me a pill. I took it for a long time. I think… I think I stopped taking it a few years ago. He said it was okay. And… my knees. They hurt. He said it was arthritis.
DOCTOR: Okay, a history of hypertension, managed with medication previously, and arthritis in the knees. Do you recall the name of the medication you were taking for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh… no, I do not remember the name. A little white pill. That is all I remember. My husband, he knows. But he is not here now.
DOCTOR: Alright, a small white pill for hypertension, name unknown. We can try to obtain that information from your previous records. Have you ever had any surgeries, Ms. Abdollahi?
PATIENT: Hmm… Let me see. I had my gallbladder out. A long time ago. And… I broke my arm when I was a little girl. But that was… very long ago.
DOCTOR: Cholecystectomy – gallbladder removal – and a fractured arm in childhood. And what about allergies?
PATIENT: No allergies. Not that I know of. I can eat anything. I like to cook, you know? I try new things all the time.
DOCTOR: No known allergies. Good. And are you currently taking any medications, besides what you may have taken for your blood pressure in the past?
PATIENT: Just a little pain pill for my knees. When they hurt very bad. And… sometimes I take something for sleep. Just when I cannot sleep.
DOCTOR: Alright, a pain medication for your knees as needed, and a sleep aid occasionally. Do you remember the names of those medications as well?
PATIENT: The pain pill… it is yellow. Small, yellow pill. I get it from the pharmacy. The sleep pill… it is blue. I take it only when I really need it. I think it has the letter “Z” in the name? I am not very good with names.
DOCTOR: Yellow pain pill and a blue sleep aid, possibly containing the letter "Z". We'll need to verify those. Now, regarding your family history... Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – heart disease, stroke, diabetes, dementia, anything like that?
PATIENT: Hmm… My mother, she had a bad heart. She died when she was old. And my brother… he had the sugar sickness. Diabetes. And… my aunt, she… she forgot things. She was very old when it started.
DOCTOR: History of heart disease in your mother, diabetes in your brother, and memory issues in an aunt. Okay. And finally, can you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: I live with my husband. We have a small garden. I like to cook and read. I go to church on Sundays. I do not go out much anymore. It is hard to get around.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Abdollahi, thank you for that information. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam to get a better understanding of your current health status. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That is fine. Whatever you need.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Let's start with your blood pressure and pulse. Your blood pressure is 148/86, pulse is 72 and regular. A little elevated, but not unexpected given your history. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, but there's a slight murmur. Lungs are clear. Let's check your reflexes. Reflexes are normal. Now, I'm going to check your feet for swelling and sensation. There is some mild swelling in both feet, particularly on the ankles. Sensation is intact, but slightly diminished. I’m also going to take a look at your knees to see what is going on. There’s some tenderness and crepitus in both knees, consistent with osteoarthritis. Overall, your examination findings are consistent with your reported symptoms and medical history. I also note some mild cognitive slowing, although this requires further investigation.
PATIENT: Cognitive… what does that mean, Doctor? Is that bad?
DOCTOR: Cognitive slowing simply means that your thinking and processing speed may be a little slower than it used to be. It doesn't necessarily indicate anything serious, but it warrants further evaluation to determine the underlying cause. It could be due to a number of factors, including age, medication side effects, or other medical conditions. We'll need to do some further testing. I would like to order some blood work to check your thyroid function, vitamin levels, and rule out any other potential causes for your symptoms. I also recommend a basic cognitive assessment to further evaluate your memory and thinking skills. And, because of the slight murmur I heard, an EKG to check your heart rhythm.
PATIENT: Oh dear. So many tests. Is it… is it something bad, Doctor? Will I have to go to the hospital?
DOCTOR: No, Ms. Abdollahi, it doesn't necessarily mean anything is seriously wrong. These tests are simply a precaution to get a more complete picture of your health and rule out any potential underlying causes for your symptoms. We are not expecting you to go to the hospital at this time. The blood work and EKG can be done here in the clinic, and the cognitive assessment is a simple test we can do right here in the office as well. It will give us a clearer understanding of what's going on and allow us to develop an appropriate plan of care. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Okay. If it is not the hospital, then that is good. Yes, I will do the tests. But… will it take long? My husband, he is waiting for me.
DOCTOR: The blood work will take about 15-20 minutes. The EKG is very quick, about five minutes. The cognitive assessment will take approximately 30-45 minutes. We can certainly expedite things as much as possible. While we are waiting for the results, I will also review your previous medical records to see if we can get more information about the medications you were taking for your blood pressure and other medical conditions. Once we have all the information, we can discuss the results and develop an appropriate plan of care. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… okay. Thank you. Let us get started then.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Let's start with the blood work. The phlebotomist will be in shortly to draw a few vials. After that, we’ll get you hooked up to the EKG machine. I’ll be back to check on you shortly. Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. I will.
