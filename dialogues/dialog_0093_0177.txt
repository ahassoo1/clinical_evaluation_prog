DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Genard. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Eriberto Bakan. It's a pleasure to meet you. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Eriberto, you said? Hmm. Well, it's… something down there. It's… icky. A little wet, and… not right. I don’t know what it is, but it’s bothering me. I haven't been to a doctor in… a long, long time.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that with me, Ms. Genard. It takes courage to come in and discuss these things, and I appreciate you doing so. “Something down there” – could you elaborate a bit on that for me?
PATIENT: Elaborate? What does that mean? I told you, it’s wet. And… kinda smelly. Not a good smell, you know? It just… comes out. Sometimes more, sometimes less. It’s been going on… oh, I don’t know, maybe a week? A little longer? Time just… slips away when you get to be my age. It’s not like it's painful, exactly. Just… unpleasant. Really unpleasant.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Genard. I apologize if my phrasing was unclear. What I meant was, could you describe the discharge itself?
PATIENT: Discharge? You want me to describe it? Oh, good gracious. Well… it’s… white-ish, I guess. Sometimes a little yellow. Not clear, definitely not clear. And… kinda thick? Like… not water, but not… pudding either. It's just… stuff. I don't know what else to tell ya. I don’t spend a lot of time lookin’ at things down there, if you catch my drift. It’s… private.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Ms. Genard. You’ve described it very well, actually. White-ish to yellowish, somewhat thick… and you mentioned it comes and goes, varying in amount. Has this been accompanied by any itching, burning, or any discomfort when you urinate?
PATIENT: Burning? No, no burning. Urinating is fine. Regular as clockwork, thank you very much. Itching… sometimes, a little. But not a lot. Mostly it's just the… the wetness. And the smell. Honestly, that's the worst part. I had to… well, I had to change my clothes twice yesterday. It’s embarrassing! I always keep things… clean. I don’t know why this is happening. Maybe it’s the weather? It's so humid these days.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. Genard, and it’s good you’ve maintained good hygiene. While the weather can sometimes exacerbate things, the symptoms you’re describing – the discharge, the occasional itching, and the odor – suggest a possible vaginal infection. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to perform a brief pelvic exam. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: A… pelvic exam? Oh, dear. Now hold on just a minute. I haven’t had one of those in… well, ever, I think! Is it really necessary? I mean, I already told you what’s going on! It’s just a little wetness and a smell. Can’t you just… give me something for it? A cream, maybe? I don’t like the sound of an exam one bit. It sounds… invasive. And uncomfortable. Very uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: I completely understand your hesitation, Ms. Genard. You are right to ask. A pelvic exam would allow me to visually assess the source of the discharge and take a sample to identify the specific cause of the infection. Knowing the exact cause is important to ensure I prescribe the most effective treatment. However, I absolutely respect your wishes. We could start with a conservative approach – a topical cream that addresses common vaginal infections. But please be aware that without a definitive diagnosis, there's a chance it might not resolve the issue completely. And it's important to rule out anything more serious. Would you be willing to consider just a visual inspection, without any instruments?
PATIENT: A visual inspection… hmm. Is that… less awful? No pokin’ and proddin’? Just… lookin’? Alright. Alright, I suppose I could do that. But don't you go touchin' anything! And be quick about it, Doctor. I don't have all day. And please, tell me what you're doin' every step of the way. I don’t like surprises, you understand. I get nervous easily. Very easily.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Genard. Absolutely no surprises. I promise to explain everything before I do it, and to proceed at your pace. This will be a very quick and gentle visual inspection. I’ll simply be using a light to examine the external area and the opening of your vagina. I'll be looking for any signs of irritation, redness, or unusual discharge. First, I'll need you to lie down on the examination table with your knees bent and your feet flat on the table. I’ll provide a sheet to cover you for privacy. Is that comfortable for you?
PATIENT: Lie down? Oh, gracious. My knees aren't what they used to be, Doctor. But… alright. If I have to. Just… be gentle. And make sure that sheet is good and thick. I don’t want anyone… lookin’ at anything they shouldn’t. And hurry, please. The longer I’m layin’ here, the more nervous I’m gonna get. And can you tell me again why you need to look at it? I mean, I told you what it is! It’s wet and smelly! What more do you need to know?
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Genard. I apologize for any discomfort this is causing. We're simply confirming what you've already described – the location and appearance of the discharge. Looking visually allows me to rule out other possibilities and ensure we are treating the correct issue. It also helps determine the severity of the inflammation, if any. I'll be explaining each step as I proceed. Now, I'm just going to gently separate the labia – the outer folds of your vagina – with my gloved hand so I can get a better view. If you feel any discomfort, please let me know immediately. Okay… just taking a look now. I do see some discharge, as you mentioned, and some slight redness of the vaginal opening. It doesn’t appear to be any significant swelling. I’ll just take a quick peek inside now, just to get a better look at the vaginal walls.
PATIENT: Oh, good gracious. That’s… cold. And pokey! Be careful, Doctor, you’re poking! I don’t like that one bit. Is it serious? Is it something… bad? You’re making me very nervous. Just… hurry up and be done with it. And tell me what you’re seeing! Don’t just poke around in silence! What’s wrong with me? I just want to know if it’s serious! Is it catchin’? My granddaughter visits sometimes…
DOCTOR: I apologize sincerely, Ms. Genard. I did not intend to cause you any discomfort. That was unnecessary of me, and I’ll be much more gentle. You're right to speak up, and I appreciate you letting me know. I'm seeing some inflammation and the discharge you described. It doesn’t appear to be anything serious at this point, and it’s unlikely to be “catching,” as you put it. However, to determine the exact cause – whether it’s a common bacterial infection, a yeast infection, or something else – I'd like to take a small sample of the discharge for testing. It's a very quick and painless procedure with a cotton swab. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: A swab? You want to… stick something in there? Oh, good gracious. No. No, I don't think so. I've had enough pokin' and proddin' for one day. Just… give me something for it. A cream, like I said before. Something to make it stop. I don’t want any more tests. I'm too old for tests. And I'm sure it's nothing serious. Probably just… the humidity, like I said. Just give me the cream and let me go home. I need a nice cup of tea and a lie down. A long lie down. And no more pokin'!
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Ms. Genard. Your comfort is my priority. We can certainly proceed with a topical cream without the swab, but I want to be upfront: without a definitive diagnosis, there’s a chance it might not fully resolve the issue, and it may take longer to find relief. If your symptoms don't improve within a week, or if they worsen, it’s important to come back so we can explore further testing options. I'm going to prescribe a topical antifungal cream, as those commonly address these types of symptoms. It's applied twice daily for one week. I will also give you instructions on proper hygiene to help with comfort. Does that sound agreeable to you?
PATIENT: An antifungal… twice a day… yes, that sounds alright. As long as I don't have to come back here for more pokin'. And instructions, you said? Good. Make sure they're easy to read. My eyesight isn't what it used to be. And tell me, Doctor… is it somethin’ I should be ashamed of? All this wetness and smell? It’s… embarrassing, you know. I always keep things… clean. Is it because I’m old? Or something worse? Just tell me the truth. I can handle it. I think. Just… don’t make me come back here if I can help it.
DOCTOR: Absolutely not, Ms. Genard. There is absolutely no shame in experiencing these symptoms. These types of infections are very common, particularly as we age, due to changes in hormone levels and vaginal flora. It is not a reflection of your hygiene or anything you've done wrong. It’s a biological process, and it’s perfectly normal to seek treatment. These instructions detail proper hygiene and how to apply the cream. If you experience any burning or irritation after applying the cream, discontinue use and contact me. And, to reiterate, if your symptoms don’t improve within a week, or if they worsen, please don’t hesitate to schedule a follow-up appointment. We can then discuss further testing options. I hope you feel better soon, Ms. Genard. Please take care of yourself, and don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s all. Just… thank you, Doctor. For not… makin’ me feel too foolish. And for bein’ gentle. Well, as gentle as you could be. I appreciate it. I think I’ll go home and have that cup of tea now. And maybe a little lie down. A long, long lie down. And Doctor? Don't you go tellin' anyone about this. It’s a private matter, you understand. Very private.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Genard. Your privacy is of utmost importance to me. I assure you, this conversation and your medical information will remain completely confidential. Please take care of yourself, and don’t hesitate to reach out if you need anything. Have a good day, and get some rest.
