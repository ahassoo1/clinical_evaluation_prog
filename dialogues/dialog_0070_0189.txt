DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Rowbottom. My name is Dr. Abady. It’s a pleasure to meet you. I see here you're 88 years young. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hmph. Eighty-eight and still flyin’, more than I can say for some folks. Well, it’s this… business with my stool. Been seein’ blood, you see. Not a lot, mind you, but enough to be botherin’ an old man. Don’t know what’s gotten into it, frankly. Never happened before.
DOCTOR: I understand. Seeing blood in your stool is certainly concerning, and I appreciate you bringing it to my attention. It’s good you’re getting it checked out. To help me understand what might be going on, could you describe the blood to me?
PATIENT: Describe it? What do you mean, describe it? It's red, naturally. Blood is red, doctor. Are you new at this? It’s not… bright red, exactly. More of a… darkish red. And it’s not… coating everything, if you catch my drift. Just… streaks. Little streaks. And honestly, it's probably just somethin' I ate. I've got a strong constitution, you know. Flew planes for fifty years, barely a sniffle.
DOCTOR: You're right to ask, Mr. Rowbottom. The color and consistency of the blood can be very informative. Darker red blood often suggests it's coming from higher up in the digestive tract, while brighter red blood usually indicates a source closer to the exit. And streaks, as opposed to coating, is a helpful detail. Fifty years flying – that is impressive! A strong constitution is certainly a good thing. To get a clearer picture, could you tell me when you first noticed this blood?
PATIENT: Hmph. Well, don't go makin' a fuss over the flyin’. It was a job, same as any other. As for when I noticed it… now let me think. It was… maybe a week ago? No, more like ten days. Around the first of July, I reckon. I don't pay much attention to dates anymore, to be honest. Just happened to notice it after… well, after business. It wasn’t a large amount, which is why I didn't rush right over here. I've got better things to do than bother doctors over a little red streak.
DOCTOR: I understand. Ten days ago, around the first of July. And you said it wasn't a large amount, which is why you waited to come in. That’s perfectly reasonable. Now, has this been a one-time occurrence, or has it happened with each bowel movement since then?
PATIENT: Oh, it hasn't been every time. No, not like clockwork. Maybe three times now? Three or four? It's hard to keep track. I don't go inspectin' everything, you know. Just noticed it when I… finished up. And it wasn’t a flood, doctor. Just… there. Each time, it's been a similar amount. Not gettin' worse, not gettin' better. Just… present. A nuisance, really. Is this goin' to take long? I have an appointment with the fellas at the club later. Gin rummy, you know. Important business.
DOCTOR: Alright, three or four times over the past ten days, similar amount each time, and not getting worse. That’s helpful information, thank you. And no, I don't want to keep you from your gin rummy. To get a more complete picture, I’d like to ask a few more questions, if you don’t mind. Have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits recently?
PATIENT: Changes? What kind of changes? Look, I’m an old man. Things change. What do you expect? You want me to describe every little… movement? Honestly, doctor. I've got a life. It's been… regular enough, I suppose. Not constipated, not… loose. Just… normal. Though, now that I think about it, maybe a little more difficult to… push it out, the last few times. Not painful, mind you. Just… a bit more effort. Is that what you're gettin’ at? I don't spend my days analyzin' my… evacuations.
DOCTOR: You're absolutely right, and I apologize for the rather… direct line of questioning. It's important information, though, and I appreciate you being patient with me. So, a little more effort to pass stools recently, but not painful. That’s good to know. Have you noticed any abdominal pain or discomfort?
PATIENT: Abdominal… discomfort? Well, I'm eighty-eight years old! Everything discomforts me. My knees ache, my back aches, my… everything aches. You want me to pinpoint a specific ache in my middle? Honestly. No, no specific pain in my belly. Maybe a little gassy, now and then. Old age, you know. Can’t eat nothin’ without gettin’ a little winded. But no sharp pains, no cramping. Just… the usual old man grumbles. Is this going anywhere, Doctor? Because frankly, I'm startin' to lose patience. That gin rummy game isn’t going to play itself.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Rowbottom, and I assure you we are getting somewhere. It sounds like you've been experiencing some mild gas, but no significant abdominal pain. Now, to complete the picture, let's briefly go over your medical history. Do you have any known medical conditions, such as diabetes, heart problems, or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Hmph. Medical history. Now there's a topic. Let me think. I had my appendix out when I was a boy. That was… a long time ago. And I broke my wrist fallin' off a horse once. That's about it, really. I've always been a healthy fella. Never smoked, rarely drank – until I retired, of course. And no heart problems, no sugar sickness, no nothin'. I fly planes, remember? They don't let just anyone fly planes. They check you out pretty good. Honestly, doctor, I think I’m as healthy as a horse. Well, except for the aches and pains. And the… you know. This stool business. But that’s probably just somethin' I ate.
DOCTOR: Appendectomy and a broken wrist. Good to know. And you’ve never smoked, rarely drank until retirement, and no history of heart problems or diabetes. That’s all very helpful. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications? No. Not a one. I don’t believe in fillin' my body with chemicals. Never took nothin’ regularly. Maybe an aspirin now and then for a headache, but that’s about it. I prefer to let nature take its course, you know? And I certainly don't take any of those fancy supplements. All hocus pocus, if you ask me. A good night’s sleep and a healthy diet are all you need. Although… now that I think of it, old Maggie down the street gave me some pills for my knees. Said they were good for arthritis. But I only took them once. Made me feel a bit… fuzzy. Wouldn’t touch ‘em again. Is this gettin’ anywhere, Doctor? Because honestly… gin rummy is callin’.
DOCTOR: Alright, no regular medications, just a single dose of a knee supplement from a neighbor that didn’t agree with you. Very good. Now, before we move on, one last question about your history. Do you have any family history of colon cancer or other digestive problems?
PATIENT: Colon cancer… now there’s a morbid question. Family history… let me think. My mother… she died of somethin’ when I was young. Can't rightly recall what it was. And my father… well, he was a sailor. Died at sea, they said. No one talked much about illnesses back then. Just… gone. As for my siblings… I had a brother, but he moved to California and I haven’t seen him in fifty years. No idea what he died of. And my sister… she always was a bit frail. I think she had… the consumption? Something with her lungs. But no one ever talked about… the colon. No, no family history of… that. Just… normal deaths, as far as I know. Are we finished yet, Doctor? My gin rummy partners are likely plottin’ my downfall as we speak.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known family history of colon cancer or other digestive problems. Thank you, Mr. Rowbottom, that’s very helpful. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if you don't mind. I'll listen to your abdomen, check your pulse, and we'll do a brief rectal exam. This will help me get a better understanding of what might be going on. It's a standard procedure, and it won't take long. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: A… rectal exam? Honestly, doctor. At my age? Really? I’ve lived a long life, and I assure you, everything’s workin’ as it should. But… I suppose if it’s standard procedure… I haven't got a lot of choice, have I? Just… be quick about it, alright? And gentle. Very gentle. Gin rummy is at stake here, you know. And frankly, I find the whole thing… undignified. But alright, go ahead. Get it over with. But warn me before you… you know. I’m an old man, not a piece of machinery.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Rowbottom. I understand your concerns, and I assure you I will be as quick and gentle as possible. I will explain everything beforehand, and you are free to stop me at any time. First, I'm going to listen to your abdomen with my stethoscope. Normal bowel sounds. No abnormalities detected. Now, I will need to perform a brief rectal exam. I'm going to ask you to bend over the examination table, if you're able. I will be using lubricant and a gloved finger to gently check for any abnormalities. It may be slightly uncomfortable, but it shouldn’t be painful. Please let me know if you experience any discomfort. I detected some mild tenderness upon palpation, but no obvious masses or bleeding. Your prostate feels normal in size and consistency. There was a small amount of stool present, with some dark red streaking noted. This correlates with what you’ve described.
PATIENT: Mild tenderness, you say? Well, that’s hardly a surprise. I’m eighty-eight years old! Everything’s tender! And stool… of course there was stool. What did you expect? I just told you I had blood in it! This whole thing is… invasive and frankly, rather unpleasant. So, what does it all mean, doctor? Is it serious? Am I… dyin’? You can tell me straight. I’ve lived a long life, I'm not afraid of a little bad news. Just don’t beat around the bush. And can I go play gin rummy now? My partners are likely pilfering all my money as we speak.
DOCTOR: Mr. Rowbottom, I understand your anxiety, and I want to assure you that I will be as straightforward as possible. Based on your history and the examination, the blood in your stool, while concerning, doesn't necessarily mean you're dying. It can be caused by a number of things, including hemorrhoids, anal fissures, diverticulosis, or even certain medications. However, it’s also important to rule out more serious possibilities, such as polyps or colon cancer. Given your age, it’s better to be cautious. Therefore, I recommend a colonoscopy. This is a procedure where a thin, flexible tube with a camera is inserted into your rectum to visualize the entire colon. It will allow us to identify the source of the bleeding and take biopsies if necessary. I know it’s not a pleasant thought, but it’s the most accurate way to determine what’s going on. In the meantime, I recommend increasing your fiber intake and staying well-hydrated. I can also prescribe a stool softener if you're experiencing any constipation. What are your thoughts on proceeding with a colonoscopy?
PATIENT: A… colonoscopy? Are you serious? A camera… inside me? That sounds… barbaric! I’ve lived eighty-eight years without anyone stickin’ a camera anywhere near my… well, you know. No, no, absolutely not. I will not be subjected to such indignity. I’d rather just… live out my days. I’m an old man. What’s the point? And you want me to increase my fiber? Hydrate? I’ve been eatin’ and drinkin’ for eighty-eight years! I think I know how to take care of myself. No, doctor. No colonoscopy. No cameras. No poking and prodding. I’m not interested. I think I’ll just… go home. And if I happen to… expire, well, that’s just the way it goes. Gin rummy is callin', and frankly, I’m startin’ to feel a bit faint. I think I’ll just… take my chances. Thank you for your time, doctor. But I think I’ve had enough examinations for one day. And for one lifetime, frankly.
DOCTOR: Mr. Rowbottom, I understand your reluctance, and I respect your decision. However, I strongly advise against dismissing this symptom without further investigation. While it may not be anything serious, it’s better to be safe than sorry. Given your concerns about a colonoscopy, perhaps we could consider a fecal immunochemical test as a less invasive alternative. This involves a simple stool sample that can detect the presence of blood. If the test comes back positive, we would then discuss further options. I also want to emphasize that early detection of colon cancer significantly improves treatment outcomes. If you’re still unwilling to proceed with any further testing, I will document your decision in your chart. However, I urge you to contact me immediately if you experience any new or worsening symptoms, such as abdominal pain, rectal bleeding, or changes in your bowel habits. I can provide you with a referral to a gastroenterologist if you’d like a second opinion. Is there anything else I can do for you today?
PATIENT: A FIT test… well, I suppose a stool sample is slightly less… offensive than a camera. Alright, alright, I’ll do the stool sample. But that’s it. No cameras, no prodding, no poking. Just a simple stool sample. And then, I want to be left alone. And frankly, doctor, I don’t need a referral to a gastroenterologist. I’ve lived eighty-eight years, and I think I know my own body pretty well. No, I think that’s all. Just… the stool sample. And then, I want to go home and play gin rummy. And if I happen to expire, well, that’s just the way it goes. Thank you for your time, doctor. But I think I’ve had enough of this… medical nonsense for one day. .
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Rowbottom. I have a nurse prepare the FIT test kit for you. Please follow the instructions carefully, and return the sample to the clinic as soon as possible. We'll contact you with the results as soon as they're available. In the meantime, please don’t hesitate to contact us if you have any questions or concerns. I wish you all the best, Mr. Rowbottom, and I hope you enjoy your gin rummy game. .
