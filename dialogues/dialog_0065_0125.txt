DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Belan. I'm Dr. Duplichan. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Right, well, I just… wanted to get tested for, you know, that thing. HIV. Just being sensible, really. My wife and I… we just like to be on top of these things. It’s better safe than sorry, isn’t it? Though, honestly, I doubt I have it. I’m a pretty careful person.
DOCTOR: “Sensible” is always a good approach, Mr. Belan. Though I appreciate your… confidence, routine testing is the most responsible course of action. Just to be clear, you're requesting an HIV test today?
PATIENT: Yes, exactly. An HIV test. Look, I work in compliance, alright? I deal with risk assessment all day. This is just… another assessment. And frankly, some of the things I see people doing… makes me think I'm probably the safest person in this town. So, yeah. Just the test, please. I’ve got a lot on, you know?
DOCTOR: Right. Well, while I respect your… professional diligence, Mr. Belan, a simple test request without any context isn’t really sufficient. It's not simply a matter of ticking a box. To ensure I can interpret the results accurately and provide appropriate follow-up, I need a little more information. Have you had any behaviors that might put you at risk?
PATIENT: Behaviors? What kind of question is that? Look, I'm married. Been married for… eight years now. Very happily married. Does that count as a behavior? I mean, we… you know. But it’s with my wife. Are you implying something? It’s just… a standard check-up, isn’t it? I’m starting to think I should have just gone somewhere else. This feels… intrusive.
DOCTOR: Mr. Belan, I assure you, I am not implying anything. However, HIV transmission isn't solely limited to risky behaviors with non-marital partners. While your marital status is relevant, a comprehensive assessment requires understanding all potential exposures. Have you ever had any blood transfusions?
PATIENT: Blood transfusions? No! Absolutely not. I haven’t been sick enough to need a blood transfusion in my entire life. I eat well, I exercise, I’m very careful. Honestly, the questions are a bit… ridiculous. I work with regulations! I know about safe practices! This feels like you’re treating me like some sort of… irresponsible person. And for what? A sensible precaution? I’m starting to regret even coming in. Is this a standard procedure, Doctor? Because it feels… a bit much.
DOCTOR: Mr. Belan, with all due respect, knowing your profession doesn't negate the need for a proper medical history. We are discussing a potentially life-altering infection, and it is my responsibility to gather all relevant information. Have you ever shared needles for any reason?
PATIENT: Needles? Are you serious? Do I look like someone who shares needles? I work in an office! I deal with paperwork, not… whatever it is you’re implying. This is completely unnecessary and frankly, a little offensive. I think I've answered enough questions. If you’re not going to just do the test, I’m leaving. I have a meeting in an hour, and this is wasting my time. I came here for a straightforward test, not an interrogation. Honestly, the audacity.
DOCTOR: Mr. Belan, I understand your frustration. However, I am obligated to ensure I gather enough information to provide appropriate care. Given your… resistance to providing a complete medical history, and your insistence on a test without a proper assessment, I am unable to proceed with your request at this time. I can, however, provide you with a list of local testing facilities. Perhaps they will be more amenable to your… preferences. Would you like that?
PATIENT: Fine. Yes, give me the list. I'm clearly wasting my time here. You know what? Forget it. I'll just find somewhere else. Somewhere that understands a sensible request when they see one. Honestly, the level of… judgment is astounding. I’m leaving now.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Belan. Have a good day. .
