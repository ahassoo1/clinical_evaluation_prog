DOCTOR: Alright, Janeth Micucci, 60 years old. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, it’s not really bringing me in, you see. It’s more…a formality, really. My daughter, bless her heart, she thinks I need…encouragement. A little card from the doctor, she said. A “Get Well” card. I’m perfectly fine, you understand. Not sick at all. Just…she worries.
DOCTOR: A card, right. So, no specific complaints?
PATIENT: Complaints? Heavens, no! What would I complain about? I’ve lived a good life, you know. Worked hard, raised a family. A little ache here and there is just…being alive. It's not something you need a doctor for. It's just…she insisted. My daughter. She always has to have things official if you understand what I mean.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, even with a “good life” things can change. Just to be thorough – and to appease your daughter, naturally – let’s just go through a few things. Have you noticed any changes in your energy levels recently?
PATIENT: Energy levels? Well, I’m sixty! Of course my energy levels aren’t what they used to be. That’s just common sense, isn’t it? I don't bounce around like a teenager anymore. But I still get everything done, thank you very much. I still cook, I still clean, I still…manage. Are you suggesting I’m…frail?
DOCTOR: No, absolutely not. I’m simply trying to gather information. It’s standard procedure. Have you had any difficulty with walking, or balance, perhaps?
PATIENT: Walking? Balance? I walk every day! To the market, to visit my neighbors… I haven't fallen or anything dramatic like that, if that's what you’re implying. Honestly, I find this rather…patronizing. My daughter sends me here for a card, and you're asking me if I can walk?
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. Let's move on then. Any changes in your appetite?
PATIENT: Appetite? It comes and goes, doesn’t it? Sometimes I’m hungrier than others. It depends. Depends on the weather, depends on what my daughter makes when she visits…depends if I’m feeling a bit…off, you know? Nothing alarming, certainly. I eat plenty.
DOCTOR: Okay. And have you noticed any unintentional weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Weight loss? Are you implying I'm thin? I've always been slender! It's my build! This is ridiculous. My daughter worries too much, and you're…you're feeding into it. I came for a card, not a medical examination.
DOCTOR: Alright, Janeth. Look. I understand you’re frustrated. But even if you feel perfectly fine, a quick check-up can sometimes identify things you wouldn’t notice yourself. It’s not about suggesting you’re ill, it’s about preventative care. And frankly, at 60, it’s responsible. I'll ask one more thing. Have you experienced any changes in your bowel habits recently?
PATIENT: Bowel habits?! That is enough! I came here for a simple card, to satisfy my daughter’s anxieties, and you're asking me about…about that?! This is deeply inappropriate. I think I’ve wasted enough of my time, and yours. You know what? Forget the card. I’ll tell my daughter I saw the doctor and she can imagine what she likes. .
