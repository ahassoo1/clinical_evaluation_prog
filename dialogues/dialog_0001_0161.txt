DOCTOR: Alright, Mrs. Trefren, so what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, well, Dr. Pehrson, it's a bit awkward to talk about, honestly. But, um, a friend suggested I look into something… something about staying safe. She said it's called PrEP, and that I should come talk to someone about it. I’m Helaina, by the way. Just wanted to get some information, really.
DOCTOR: PrEP, huh?
PATIENT: Yeah. She explained a little, but I mostly just nodded and wrote down the name. She said it could… well, protect you from things. I’m not really clear on how, or if it’s even right for me, you know? I’m single, haven’t been with anyone long-term in… a long time. But I'd rather be safe than sorry, I guess.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, it's a medication… preventative, as the name suggests. It's… for HIV prevention. Look, I’m not going to pry into your personal life, Mrs. Trefren, but it’s typically prescribed for individuals at higher risk. Do you have any… regular partners?
PATIENT: Oh, no, not really. I mean, I date sometimes, but it’s not… consistent. Just a few dates here and there. Nothing serious at all. Mostly just coffee, a movie, that sort of thing. I haven't… well, I haven't had a regular partner in decades, honestly. Is that… is that enough to even consider it? I don’t want to waste your time if it's only for people who are, you know, actively… involved.
DOCTOR: Okay. Well, it doesn’t hurt to discuss it, even if it turns out not to be necessary. It's just… a lot of people don’t understand the implications, the side effects. It's not a perfect solution, and it requires regular monitoring. Have you ever been tested for HIV?
PATIENT: Yes, I have. Um… let me think. I had a test maybe… five years ago? It was negative. I had it done at the community clinic, just part of a general check-up. I remember because the nurse was lovely, and she explained everything so clearly. I think it was… in the fall of 2020. Does that help? I have a pretty good memory for dates, actually.
DOCTOR: Okay. 2020… let me pull up your records here. Alright, yes, I see the negative test from November 12th, 2020. So, you're up to date on testing. Now, aside from sexual activity, do you have any other risk factors?
PATIENT: Risk factors? Um… what do you mean by that? I don’t do… drugs, if that’s what you’re asking. And I haven’t ever had a blood transfusion, or anything like that. I’m a pretty healthy person, generally. I walk a lot, try to eat well, although I do love my sweets. Is there something specific I should be thinking about? I just don't want to miss anything important.
DOCTOR: Right, right. Okay. Well, we just want to cover all bases. Sometimes, certain medical procedures can increase risk, though it sounds like you're already quite careful. Tell me, do you have any family history of… autoimmune diseases?
PATIENT: Autoimmune diseases? Hmm… let me think. My mother had rheumatoid arthritis, I think it was. And my aunt, on my father’s side, had lupus. Not sure if that counts, though? They were both quite old when they got sick, and I always thought it was just… old age, you know? But now that you mention it… yes, those two. Is that something that matters for this PrEP thing?
DOCTOR: Okay. So, rheumatoid arthritis and lupus in the family. That's… relevant. Look, Mrs. Trefren, while you've had a negative HIV test and don’t have obvious risk factors, these autoimmune conditions could affect how you respond to PrEP. It requires regular blood work to monitor kidney function and other things. Honestly, it might be… more trouble than it’s worth for you, given your… lifestyle. What are your thoughts?
PATIENT: Oh. Well, that’s… disappointing. I was hoping it would just be a simple thing, you know? Something I could do to be extra safe. But if it’s going to involve a lot of tests and… worry, and it’s probably not even necessary… I don’t want to put you through all that work for nothing. I guess I just wanted to explore all my options. So… is it a definite no? Or is there anything else I could consider? I just really appreciate you being honest with me. I don’t want to waste your time.
DOCTOR: Look, let's be frank. It's a medication with potential side effects, requires diligent follow-up, and your risk profile doesn't scream “necessity.” We could do the baseline testing, just to be thorough, but I’m not convinced it’s the right course of action for you. Safer sex practices—condoms, limiting partners—are often sufficient. I’m willing to do the tests if you insist, but I want you to understand it's likely not going to be a beneficial treatment. And it will take up my time, and the lab's resources. Do you want to proceed?
PATIENT: No. You're right. It does sound like a lot of hassle for something I probably don’t even need. I don't want to take up your time, or the lab's resources, for nothing. I think… I think I was just being overly cautious. Safer sex practices are good enough. I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly, Dr. Pehrson. You've been very helpful. I think I'll just… go back to being careful, and not worry so much. Thank you.
DOCTOR: Alright. Good. That's probably best. If anything changes—new partners, increased risk—don't hesitate to schedule another appointment. And, uh… stay safe. You’re all set.
