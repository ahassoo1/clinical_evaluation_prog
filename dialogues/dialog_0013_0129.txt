DOCTOR: Hi Dawnetta, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Morenomartinez. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello. Well, frankly, I haven’t got all day. It’s my… well, it’s my stool. It’s black. And I take those pain pills, you know, the ones for my arthritis. Been taking them for years. I figured it might be that, but my daughter insisted I come see someone. Honestly, doctors these days… always wanting to poke and prod.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand you’re concerned about the black stool and you're already thinking it might be related to your arthritis medication, which is good. And I completely respect that you’re short on time – we’ll try to be efficient. It’s always best to check these things out, though, just to be sure. Your daughter sounds like a good advocate for your health. To start, can you tell me a bit more about when you first noticed the black stool?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s been a few days, I suppose. Three, maybe four? It’s hard to say, I don't sit around analyzing everything that goes down the toilet, you know? It just… was black. And it's not like it's every time, just sometimes. Honestly, I just hope it's nothing serious. I've got things to do.
DOCTOR: Right, three or four days, not every time. That’s helpful. And I appreciate you telling me that – we definitely don't expect anyone to be scrutinizing everything. Okay. Has there been any change in the amount of stool you’re passing?
PATIENT: No, not really. Same as always, I suppose. Look, are we going to get to the point of this or what? I haven’t got all day to discuss my… bodily functions. It’s black, I take pills, can we just figure out if it’s something I need to worry about or not? My time is valuable, you know.
DOCTOR: You’re right to ask. I do want to be mindful of your time. We’re getting there. Black stool can be caused by a number of things, and given your medication, that’s a reasonable place to start thinking. Just to be thorough, I need to ask a few more quick questions to rule out other possibilities. Have you noticed any abdominal pain, weakness, or fatigue along with this?
PATIENT: Abdominal pain? Not particularly. A little bit of discomfort sometimes, but I’m 73! Everything aches. Weakness, no. And fatigue? Honestly, I’m always a little tired. It’s called getting old, dear. Look, is this medication causing this or not? That’s what I need to know. I don’t need a whole life story asked about.
DOCTOR: Okay, I hear you. It’s very good that you haven’t had any significant pain or weakness. And yes, the pain pills can absolutely cause black stool. They can irritate the stomach lining or cause small bleeding, which turns the stool dark. However, just to be completely safe, and since you mentioned taking them for years, I’d like to quickly review your medical history, just to see if there's anything else that could be contributing. I have access to your records here. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, for goodness sake. You've got my records? What else do you have? Fine, look at them, I suppose. Just get on with it. My daughter will have a fit if I'm here all day. I told her I'd be quick, and frankly, I'm starting to regret letting her talk me into this. Just tell me if it's something I need to worry about. And if it is the pills, can we just adjust the dosage or something? I need these pills!
DOCTOR: Okay, I see you have a history of osteoarthritis, hypertension managed with [medication name], and a previous cholecystectomy… gallbladder removal. No history of ulcers or GI bleeding, which is good. Given everything – the pills you’re taking, the lack of other concerning symptoms, and your medical history – it’s likely this is related to the pain medication. However, even though it's likely, we should still rule out other possibilities. To do that, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, just to listen to your abdomen and check for any tenderness. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Oh, honestly. Physical exam? Really? Must you poke and prod everything? Fine, whatever. But make it quick. And be gentle! I bruise easily. My daughter will be furious if I come home with marks all over me. Just get it over with. But I'm telling you, it's the pills. I just know it.
DOCTOR: Alright, Dawnetta, I'll be as gentle as possible, I promise. We'll just listen to your abdomen with the stethoscope, and I'll lightly palpate it to check for any tenderness. It shouldn't take more than a minute or two. Okay. Your abdomen is soft, and I’m not hearing any unusual sounds. There’s no significant tenderness to the touch, which is reassuring. Your bowel sounds are normal. I'm going to order a stool test to check for hidden blood. It's a quick, non-invasive test you can do at home. It will just help confirm if the discoloration is from the medication or something else. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Hidden blood? More tests! Oh, honestly… Fine, whatever you think is necessary. Just tell me where I need to go to do this test, and I’ll get it over with. I’m starting to think I should have just ignored my daughter. A little black stool isn’t worth all this fuss. Just make it quick, and I want the results as soon as possible. I’ve got things to do. Things!
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Dawnetta, and I do appreciate your patience. The stool test is very simple. You’ll get a kit from the lab – it comes with instructions and a collection container. You'll just collect a small sample at home and drop it off at the lab. It usually takes a few days to get the results. In the meantime, to be cautious, I’m going to recommend we temporarily reduce your dosage of the pain medication by [reduced dosage amount] and see if that makes a difference in the stool color. If the color doesn't improve or if it gets worse, we’ll revisit the dosage or explore other pain management options. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Reduce the dosage… hmm. Well, I do need these pills, you know. My arthritis is killing me. But alright, fine. Reduce it, if that's what you think is best. But if the pain gets worse, I’m coming right back. And I expect you to remember that! Look, I’ve got to go. Where do I get this kit and drop off the sample? Just tell me quickly, and let me get out of here. I’m sure my daughter is wondering what’s keeping me. Honestly, doctors… always making a mountain out of a molehill.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. Here's the requisition for the stool test. The lab is just down the hall, room 203. You can pick up the kit there, and they’ll tell you where to drop off the sample once you’ve collected it. And yes, please do come back if the pain worsens. We’ll figure out a way to manage it. I've also documented everything we discussed today, including the temporary dosage reduction, so it's all in your chart. Here’s my card with the clinic number if you have any questions or concerns. I hope you feel better soon, Dawnetta. And please try not to worry too much. .
PATIENT: Hmph. Alright, fine. Thank you. I suppose. Honestly… Making a fuss over nothing... all these tests... I just want my pills.
