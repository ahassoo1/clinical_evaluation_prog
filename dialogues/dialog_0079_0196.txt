DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Licano. I am Dr. GonzalezPerez. It says here you're 52 years of age. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Yes, that's right, 52. Um… it's this tiredness. Just… always tired. It's been going on for… a while now, I guess. Honestly, it's hard to say how long. Everything feels a bit fuzzy these days.
DOCTOR: “A while now,” is… not particularly helpful for a medical history, I’m afraid. Can you try to be more specific?
PATIENT: Oh, I know, I know. Sorry. It's just… everything blends together. Let me think… maybe… six months? Or was it longer? Before the… before my husband… oh dear. It definitely got worse after then, but I was feeling run down even before that, I think. I really can't pinpoint it exactly. It's frustrating, even for me.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let’s proceed with ‘approximately six months’ then. And you mentioned it worsened after your husband’s passing. I offer my condolences, by the way. Now, aside from the tiredness, are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. That's… kind. Other symptoms… hmm. Let me see. I feel a bit achy, you know, like after a really hard day of gardening, but I haven’t been gardening. And… sometimes I just can’t seem to focus. My memory’s not what it used to be, if you haven’t noticed. It’s little things mostly. Like forgetting what I went into a room for.
DOCTOR: Achiness and difficulty concentrating… and memory lapses. Are these memory lapses consistent, or do they come and go?
PATIENT: Oh, they definitely come and go. Some days are better than others. But lately… it's been more often. It’s like… a fog. Not all the time, but enough to be worrying. I worry I’ll forget important things, you know? Doctor's appointments… paying bills… things like that.
DOCTOR: I understand. And has this tiredness—this… fog—affected your daily activities?
PATIENT: Oh, terribly. I used to be… I was very active. Always cleaning, cooking, visiting friends. Now… I mostly just sit. I don't have the energy for much else. Even simple things, like making a meal, feel like a huge effort. I’ve been letting things slide, to be honest. The house isn't as clean, I eat… simpler things. I don't see my friends as much. It’s just… easier to stay put.
DOCTOR: Right. Now, Ms. Licano, I see here your height is listed as 187 centimeters and your weight as 108 kilograms. Are those figures accurate?
PATIENT: Oh! Yes, Doctor, I believe so. Though… honestly, I haven't weighed myself recently. I used to, but… it just felt like another thing I didn't have the energy for. My husband always did the measuring, you see. He kept track of everything.
DOCTOR: I see. And are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Um… just the usual. For my blood pressure, I think. A little white pill. And… something for my cholesterol, maybe? I really don’t keep track anymore. My husband handled all that, too. He had a whole chart of everything. I'm sorry, I'm just… not very helpful, am I?
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Ms. Licano. We’ll get through this. Do you recall the names of these medications, or perhaps the dosages?
PATIENT: Oh dear… no, I truly don't. I can tell you they’re both small pills. One's white, like I said, and the other… maybe a pale yellow? I take them every morning, with my breakfast. That's all I really know. I wish I could be more precise, Doctor. It’s just… after my husband… everything got a bit muddled.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, have you experienced any other symptoms—anything at all—that we haven’t discussed?
PATIENT: Hmm… Let me think. No, not that I can recall. Maybe… a little bit of trouble sleeping sometimes. I wake up in the middle of the night and can’t get back to sleep. But that’s probably just from worrying. Or… maybe the tiredness. It’s hard to tell what’s causing what these days.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Licano. I think it’s time we conduct a brief physical examination. I’d like to check your vital signs, listen to your heart and lungs, and perform a neurological assessment. Is that acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Oh… yes, yes, that's fine, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I just want to… feel better. If this will help, then yes, please. I suppose I should get on with it then.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you'll just follow me over here. First, let's take your blood pressure. 140 over 90. Slightly elevated, but not alarming. Now, your pulse is 72 and regular. Heart sounds are normal. No murmurs or irregularities detected. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Reflexes are… somewhat diminished. Coordination is a little unsteady. This is not immediately concerning given your reported fatigue, but it is something we'll need to monitor. Now, I’m going to check your thyroid. Thyroid feels… slightly enlarged, but no obvious nodules are present. One moment. Could you please repeat these three words for me?
PATIENT: Three words…? Oh dear. Alright, um… "apple", "table", "pencil". Now, to repeat… "apple", "pencil", "table". Is that right? I think I got them in the wrong order. It’s just… everything feels so jumbled today.
DOCTOR: That's alright. Now, can you tell me what year it is?
PATIENT: Oh… Oh dear. Let me see. Um… is it… 2024? No, wait… 2025? Yes, 2025. I think. It feels like all the years are blurring together lately. I really should pay more attention.
DOCTOR: Right. Now, Ms. Licano, given your reported fatigue, memory lapses, slightly enlarged thyroid, and diminished reflexes, I’d like to order some blood work. Specifically, I want a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, a thyroid-stimulating hormone level, and a vitamin D level. We’ll also do a urinalysis. And I think it would be prudent to schedule a brain MRI to rule out any structural abnormalities.
PATIENT: Oh… That sounds… like a lot of tests, Doctor. Is it… is it serious? I’m a bit worried now. All this talk of MRIs and blood work… It’s just… I just want to know why I feel so awful.
DOCTOR: It's understandable to be concerned, Ms. Licano. We are ordering these tests not to immediately assume the worst, but to gather information. The symptoms you are describing—fatigue, memory lapses—can have a variety of causes. The MRI is a precautionary measure to rule out more serious possibilities. The blood work will help us assess your overall health and identify any deficiencies or imbalances. I want to be thorough and ensure we arrive at an accurate diagnosis. We'll discuss the results as soon as they are available. In the meantime, I recommend you try to get as much rest as possible and maintain a balanced diet. I’m also going to write you a prescription for a low-dose vitamin D supplement, as your levels may be low. Now, do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Oh… I… alright. Yes, rest, I can try. It’s just hard, you know? Worrying keeps me awake. And… a vitamin, yes. Okay. Um… questions? No, I don’t think so. Just… when will I get the results? And will someone explain them to me? I don’t really understand all the medical terms.
DOCTOR: The lab results should be available within five to seven business days. The radiology department will contact you to schedule the MRI. Once we have all the results, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them in detail. And yes, absolutely, I will personally explain everything to you in plain language. I will make sure you understand what’s going on and what our next steps are. Do you have any other concerns at this time, Ms. Licano?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think… that's everything. I just… I’m very grateful for your time and attention. It’s a relief to finally be doing something about this. I just hope it’s not… anything too serious.
DOCTOR: You are welcome, Ms. Licano. We will do everything we can to determine the cause of your symptoms and develop an appropriate treatment plan. Please don’t hesitate to contact the office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have another patient waiting. I wish you well. .
