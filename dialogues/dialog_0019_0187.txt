DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Sobkowicz. Welcome. It's nice to meet you. I'm Dr. Renzi. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hmph. Good morning. Chest… feel funny. And heart… thump thump. Blood pressure, they say too high. Old man problems, you know? Just want quick fix, okay? Don’t have all day.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. “Funny” how, exactly?
PATIENT: Like… fluttering. Like bird in chest. Sometimes feel tight. Not always. And… dizzy little bit. Mostly when… when I get upset. Wife… she worry too much, make it worse! You understand? It's stress, mostly. Old man stress.
DOCTOR: I do understand. Stress can definitely cause those kinds of feelings. Okay, so fluttering, tightness, and dizziness… and it seems to be worse when you're upset. Do you feel this fluttering constantly, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Come and go! Not all day, thank goodness. Maybe… few times a week? When wife yell, or… or bills come. Things like that. Not… not a steady thing. I still work, you know! Emergency Management. Need to be strong. Not like… sick old man.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear you’re still working. It’s important to stay active. A few times a week… alright. And the dizziness - is that a spinning sensation, or more like you're lightheaded?
PATIENT: Lightheaded! Not spinning. Like… brain not get enough blood. Quick… goes away quick. But… annoying. Makes me angry, and then wife yell more. It's a circle, you see? Bad circle. Just… fix it. I don’t want to be weak.
DOCTOR: I do see. Okay, so lightheadedness, not spinning. And it sounds like stress is a big factor. Now, have you been having any other symptoms, Mr. Sobkowicz?
PATIENT: Other… hmmm. Sometimes… little bit of shortness of breath. When walk up stairs. Not bad, but… I get tired. And… feet swell a little at end of day. Wife say so. I don't pay attention to feet. Mostly just want to sit. You understand? Old man things.
DOCTOR: I understand. Okay, shortness of breath with stairs and some swelling in your feet. And you mentioned your wife pointed that out. Have you noticed any pain in your chest with the shortness of breath?
PATIENT: No pain. Just… hard to breathe. Like… lungs not fill up all the way. Not sharp pain, not like… heart attack pain. Just… tired lungs. That’s how I explain it to wife. She watch too much TV, you know? All those medical dramas. Makes her worry.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, and I appreciate you explaining it so well. Alright. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your past medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any conditions, like diabetes or high cholesterol?
PATIENT: Hmmm. Cholesterol… doctor say little high long time ago. Take pill for it. Still take it. Diabetes… no. Never told I have diabetes. Just… old man things. High blood pressure now, they say. That’s new. And… that’s all I remember. Wife keep all the papers. She the doctor, really.
DOCTOR: Alright, so high cholesterol in the past, currently on medication for that, and recently diagnosed with high blood pressure. That's helpful. Any surgeries or hospital stays you can recall?
PATIENT: Hmmm… appendix when I young. Long, long time ago. And… broken arm when I was boy. Fell from tree. Chasing girl. Stupid thing. Nothing else! I strong man. Don’t need hospital.
DOCTOR: Alright, appendix as a child and a broken arm. Good to know. Now, do any family members have any medical conditions, like heart disease or stroke?
PATIENT: Mother… heart trouble. Long time ago, she sick. Died when I young. Father… strong man. Never sick. But… her sister, auntie… she have… something with brain. Stroke, maybe? Wife say. I don’t remember all the details. Old family history, you know? Not important.
DOCTOR: Okay, mother with heart trouble, and an aunt with possible stroke. That's helpful to know. Now, a few quick questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Smoke? Never! Stupid habit. Alcohol… little bit sometimes. With dinner. One glass of wine. Maybe two. Doctor say okay. Small amount. Not like… big drinker. I need to be strong for job, you understand? Emergency Management. Can't be drunk.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. One or two glasses of wine with dinner is fine. And lastly, are you currently taking any medications other than the cholesterol medication?
PATIENT: Just the pill for cholesterol. Little white pill. Take it every morning. That’s it! I don’t like taking pills. Makes me feel weak. That’s why I want quick fix, okay? Don't need many pills.
DOCTOR: Alright, just the cholesterol medication. Okay, Mr. Sobkowicz, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs now, and then I’ll check your blood pressure and pulse. After that, I’d like to do a quick exam of your legs and feet. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Do quick. I have meeting this afternoon. Important meeting. Emergency Management, you know? Can’t be gone all day. Hurry, please.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Sobkowicz. I’ll be as quick as possible. Let’s start with your heart. Please take a deep breath for me… Okay… I hear a regular rhythm, but there's a slight murmur. It’s not alarming, but something we should keep an eye on. Now, let’s listen to your lungs. Your lungs sound a little congested, mostly at the bases. And I'll check your blood pressure and pulse now… Blood pressure is 160/90 – a little elevated, as you mentioned. Pulse is 78 and regular. Now, I'll just quickly examine your legs and feet… Okay, some mild swelling in your ankles, as your wife mentioned. Everything else looks okay.
PATIENT: Hmph. See? Told you. High blood pressure. Everything else… just old man things. So… what now? Give me pill? Make it quick. Meeting soon, remember? Emergency Management. Important.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Sobkowicz. It sounds like we’re dealing with a few things: your high blood pressure, some congestion in your lungs, and the swelling in your ankles. It’s good you’re proactive about your health, and it is good to address these issues. While a medication for your blood pressure is likely necessary, I also want to rule out a few other possibilities causing the congestion and swelling. It could be related to your heart, or it could be something else. I'd like to order a few tests to get a better picture. A chest X-ray to look at your lungs, an EKG to check your heart rhythm, and some blood work to check your kidney function and rule out other causes for the swelling. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Tests? More tests? Hmph. Fine. But quick, okay? And… can I still go to meeting? Emergency Management… can’t miss important meeting. Just… make it fast. I don't like hospitals. And I really don't like tests.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Sobkowicz. The tests are relatively quick and straightforward. The chest X-ray and EKG will only take a few minutes each, and the blood work will be done right here in the clinic. We can get the blood work done quickly. The results should be back within a couple of days, and then we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, I do recommend limiting your salt intake and avoiding strenuous activity until we have a better understanding of what's going on. As for your meeting… yes, you can still attend your meeting. However, if you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath, or dizziness, please stop what you're doing and seek immediate medical attention. Okay?
PATIENT: Hmph. Fine. Salt… okay, I try. No strenuous… okay. But important meeting! Can’t just… not go. Tests… quickly. Quickly! And then… tell me what to do. No more tests after that, okay? Just… fix it. I’m a busy man, you see. Emergency Management. .
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Sobkowicz. We'll get these tests done quickly, and I promise to keep things as efficient as possible. I’ll make a note to discuss the results with you and come up with a plan as quickly as possible. I'll have the nurse come in to draw your blood and schedule the chest X-ray and EKG. In the meantime, if you experience any changes in your symptoms, please don't hesitate to call us. Thank you for coming in today. And thank you for your service in Emergency Management. We'll get this sorted out. .
