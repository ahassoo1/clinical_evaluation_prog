DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Snerling. I am Dr. Yackey. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s a bit difficult to explain. I’ve been feeling rather unsteady on my feet lately. Like I might fall. It’s been… happening for a little while now, I think. I don't quite remember when it started, truthfully.
DOCTOR: Unsteady… right. And you say this has been going on for “a little while.” Can you be more specific?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Specific… That is hard. I work out in the oil fields, you see, as a rotary drill operator. It’s… demanding work. Perhaps it started around… spring, maybe? Or was it summer? It all feels a bit hazy, honestly. It wasn’t sudden, that much I recall. Just… gradually worse. I haven’t fallen yet, but I’ve had a few close calls. It's worrying, naturally.
DOCTOR: Oil fields… demanding work, yes. And a gradual onset of instability. Right. Are you experiencing this unsteadiness constantly, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It comes and goes, I believe. It’s… worse when I’m tired, definitely. A long shift, or if I haven't slept well. But even when I’m rested, it… flares up sometimes. Just walking around, or even standing still. It's difficult to describe. It’s not a spinning sensation, if that makes sense. More like… my feet aren't quite connected to the ground. Does that… clarify anything?
DOCTOR: "Feet not connected…" Right. And aside from this unsteadiness, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… hmm. That’s a good question. Let me think. I've been… more tired than usual, certainly. But that could be the job, couldn’t it? I suppose my vision gets a bit blurry sometimes, but I wear glasses, and they aren't new. And… oh! I’ve had a few headaches. Not terrible, just… dull aches. It's all rather muddled, I'm afraid. My apologies. I wish I could be more precise.
DOCTOR: Blurry vision, headaches… and increased fatigue. Do you have any ringing in your ears, any difficulty hearing, or any numbness or weakness in your limbs?
PATIENT: Ringing in my ears… no, I don’t think so. My hearing is… well, it’s not what it used to be, working around all the machinery, but no ringing. And no numbness or weakness. Everything feels normal, aside from feeling… off-balance. It's just this strange sensation in my feet, and… the tiredness, of course. I haven’t noticed anything else. Is that… helpful? I’m trying my best to recall everything. It's just… difficult.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Medications… Oh, goodness. Let me see. I was prescribed something for my blood pressure a few months ago, but I stopped taking it. It made me feel… unwell. I don’t recall the name, I'm afraid. And… that’s all. I generally avoid medications if I can. I prefer to tough things out, if you understand. It’s… a habit. A bad habit, perhaps.
DOCTOR: Discontinued antihypertensive… Alright. And do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… no, not that I’m aware of. I’ve always been quite fortunate in that regard. I can eat anything, and I’ve never had a reaction to any medications. At least, not that I recall. I’ve never needed to worry about it before. Is this… standard procedure, Doctor? I apologize for being so vague. It’s just… everything feels a bit distant.
DOCTOR: Standard procedure, yes. Now, Ms. Snerling, I'm going to need to perform a brief physical examination. I’ll need you to stand and walk a few steps for me, if you’re able. This will help me assess your balance and coordination.
PATIENT: Yes, of course. I can do that. I… I’m a little nervous, if I’m honest. But I’ll try my best. Just let me know if I… if I stumble.
DOCTOR: Please. Walk a few steps forward, then turn around and walk back. I’ll be observing your gait and balance. Don't rush. Okay… a slightly wide-based gait. Mild unsteadiness, especially with the turn. No obvious signs of weakness. Romberg test… Now, please close your eyes and stand as still as you can. Let me know if you feel unsteady.
PATIENT: Oh… oh dear. I… I do feel unsteady. Yes, definitely unsteady. I… I wouldn't want to fall. Perhaps I should sit down?
DOCTOR: Yes, please, sit down. Alright. That's helpful. And now, a quick neurological exam. I'm going to check your reflexes and coordination. Please relax.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. Just… please let me know if I need to stop. I… I’ve never had anything like this happen before, and I’m rather worried, if I’m honest.
DOCTOR: Okay… reflexes are normal. Now, can you follow my finger with your eyes without moving your head?
PATIENT: Yes, I can, Doctor. Like this? It’s… a little difficult to concentrate, but I’m trying my best.
DOCTOR: Alright. And now, can you touch your finger to your nose with your eyes open, and then close your eyes and do the same?
PATIENT: Yes, I can… It’s… a little harder with my eyes closed, Doctor. I’m afraid my coordination isn’t what it used to be. Perhaps it’s just the fatigue?
DOCTOR: Alright. Based on this brief examination, it appears you're experiencing some balance and coordination issues, potentially exacerbated by fatigue. However, the presentation isn’t definitive. To rule out other possibilities, I'm going to order some blood work, including a complete blood count and a vitamin B12 level. I'm also going to order an MRI of the brain to assess for any structural abnormalities. Do you understand?
PATIENT: An MRI… and blood work? Yes, I understand, Doctor. But… what could be causing this? Is it something… serious? I apologize, I… I’m rather anxious. The thought of an MRI is… unsettling. Perhaps you could explain what you're looking for? And… how long will it take to get the results?
DOCTOR: Ms. Snerling, it’s important not to jump to conclusions. There are a number of potential causes for these symptoms – vitamin deficiencies, inner ear problems, even certain medications. The blood work and MRI are simply to rule out more serious possibilities. The MRI will help us visualize your brain and identify any structural abnormalities. It’s a non-invasive procedure, though I understand your anxiety. The results typically take 24 to 48 hours to come back. I will also provide you with a referral to a neurologist for a more comprehensive evaluation. They are the specialists in these types of conditions. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: A neurologist… yes, that sounds… prudent. If you think it’s best. And 24 to 48 hours for the results… alright. That… that’s manageable. And in the meantime… is there anything I should do? Avoid driving? Rest more? I work out in the oil fields, Doctor. It’s… difficult to simply stop working. Perhaps reducing my hours? Is that advisable?
DOCTOR: Reducing your hours is certainly advisable, Ms. Snerling. And yes, I would strongly recommend avoiding driving until we have the results of the MRI and a proper diagnosis. Given your work environment, the risk of falling or causing an accident is too high. Do not operate heavy machinery. Rest is also crucial. It sounds like you've been pushing yourself. I will also prescribe you a course of vitamin B12 supplements, just as a precautionary measure. It's unlikely to cause harm, and it may provide some symptomatic relief. Do you have any allergies to vitamins?
PATIENT: No allergies to vitamins, Doctor. No driving… no heavy machinery… reduced hours… It’s… a lot to take in. And the B12 supplements… how long should I take those for? And what should I do if my symptoms worsen while I’m waiting for the results? Is there a number I can call, if I feel particularly unsteady? Or… should I go to the emergency room? I… I apologize for all the questions. I’m just… anxious, as you can imagine.
DOCTOR: The B12 supplements are a high dose, take one tablet daily for one month. If your symptoms worsen significantly – sudden weakness, severe dizziness, difficulty speaking – go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Otherwise, you can contact my office directly, and we will schedule an urgent appointment. Here is the number. I understand your anxiety, Ms. Snerling. We're taking this seriously and will work to get a diagnosis as quickly as possible. I'll also send the referral to the neurologist to your insurance company. Do you have any further questions at this time?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all for now, Doctor. Thank you. Thank you for… being patient with me. I apologize again for being so vague. I wish I could be more helpful. I suppose I’ll… schedule the MRI as soon as possible. Thank you, Doctor Yackey. .
DOCTOR: You're welcome, Ms. Snerling. Get the MRI scheduled promptly, and please do not hesitate to contact the office if you experience any concerning changes. Have a good day. .
