DOCTOR: Hi Criston, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Maskal. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hello Doctor. Good to meet you too. I… how you say… my pee is orange. It started a few days ago. Not normal color, very bright orange.
DOCTOR: Okay, orange urine. That's definitely worth checking out. And it started a few days ago, you said?
PATIENT: Yes, maybe three, four days. I drink water, normal amount. Not much change. My wife, she say I should come see doctor. She worry.
DOCTOR: That’s good of her to encourage you to come in. It's always best to get things checked out. To help me understand what might be going on, can you tell me a little more about the color?
PATIENT: It's… like orange juice, but darker. Not like, pale orange. More… strong orange. I don't know how to explain good. I never see this color before.
DOCTOR: Okay, a strong, dark orange – that's helpful. And you haven't noticed any pain or burning when you urinate, or any changes in how often you're going?
PATIENT: No pain. No burning. Same amount, I think. Maybe a little less, now that I think about it. But not much. I drink coffee, every morning. Maybe that?
DOCTOR: Okay, a slight decrease in amount and you drink coffee regularly. Coffee can sometimes contribute to dehydration, which can affect urine color, but strong orange is less common with just that. Do you have any other symptoms – like fatigue, nausea, changes in your stool color, or any pain in your abdomen or back?
PATIENT: No nausea. I feel… normal, I think. Maybe a little tired, but I work long hours. Stool is normal color. No pain anywhere. My job is… building things. Lots of walking, lots of sun. Could be that? I forget to drink enough water when I busy.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you work in construction, long hours, lots of sun exposure, and you sometimes forget to drink enough water. That's good information. Let’s talk about your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions – like diabetes, liver problems, or kidney issues?
PATIENT: No, never. I am healthy man. I go to work, I eat good food, I sleep okay. No problems. My wife, she always checks I am okay. She is very careful. I had… a small fever, last year, but it go away quick. Nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. And have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No surgeries. Never been in hospital. Just… the fever. Small fever, like a cold. I take medicine, I rest, I get better. I am lucky, I think. No big problems. My wife, she always says I am strong like a camel.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful. And what about your family?
PATIENT: My family… my father, he had problems with his heart, when he was old. My mother, she was healthy. My brother, he has… how you say… high blood pressure. But me, I am okay. My wife's family, they are all healthy too, I think. She knows more about that than me.
DOCTOR: Okay, so some family history of heart problems and high blood pressure. And you're currently taking any medications at all, even over-the-counter ones like vitamins or pain relievers?
PATIENT: No medicine. Nothing. I take… sometimes, for my back, when it hurts from work, I take a cream. Rub it on. But no pills, no vitamins. Just the cream for my back. And coffee, every morning. That is it.
DOCTOR: Okay, just the back cream and coffee. Do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies. Never had a problem with anything. I eat all kinds of food. My wife makes good food. She puts lots of spices. I never feel sick from food. No problems with anything, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's all very helpful. Now, let’s do a quick physical exam. I’ll just listen to your heart and lungs, feel your abdomen, and check your reflexes. Then I’ll take a quick look at a urine sample. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that is okay. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. I trust you. My wife said this doctor is very good. I just want to know why my pee is orange. It makes me worry a little.
DOCTOR: I understand. We’ll figure it out. Okay, everything sounds and feels good so far. Now, let's get a urine sample. I'll have you step behind the screen when you're ready. I'll also check your blood pressure and temperature while you're back there.
PATIENT: Okay. I will go now. Just tell me what to do. I am ready. I hope it is nothing bad.
DOCTOR: Just use the provided cup and collect a sample. Don't worry about being perfect, just try to get a few ounces. I'll be right here when you’re done. And try not to worry, we'll get some answers.
PATIENT: Here you go, Doctor. I tried to get enough. It was… a little hard. I was nervous. Now what?
DOCTOR: Okay, Criston, the dipstick test shows some elevated levels of bilirubin in your urine. Bilirubin is a substance produced when the body breaks down red blood cells. Elevated levels can cause that orange color. It can be caused by a few things, including dehydration, certain medications, or liver problems. It's not necessarily serious, but we need to investigate a little further. I'm going to order some blood tests to check your liver function and kidney function, as well as a complete blood count. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Blood tests? Okay. If you think it is best, then yes. I trust you, Doctor. I just want to know what is wrong. My wife will be happy to hear we are finding out. What do I need to do for the blood tests? Where do I go?
DOCTOR: Good. I’m glad you’re willing to proceed. The lab is just down the hall, second door on the left. You don’t need an appointment. Just tell them Dr. Maskal sent you for a liver function panel, a complete blood count, and a basic metabolic panel. They’ll draw some blood. It’ll probably take about 15-20 minutes. After the lab, you can go home and we’ll call you with the results in a couple of days. Once we have those results, we can discuss the next steps. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Okay. Down the hall, second door. Liver function, complete blood count, basic… what was it? Never mind, I will remember. A couple of days. Yes, that sounds okay. Thank you, Doctor. I hope it is nothing serious. I will go do that now.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Criston. I understand your concern, and we’ll get to the bottom of this. Don't hesitate to call the clinic if you experience any new symptoms – like abdominal pain, nausea, or jaundice before we get the results. Otherwise, we'll talk soon. Have a good day, and try not to worry too much. I'll be in touch.
PATIENT: Okay. I will remember. No pain, no yellow… I will call if anything happens. Thank you again, Doctor. You are very kind. Good day to you too.
