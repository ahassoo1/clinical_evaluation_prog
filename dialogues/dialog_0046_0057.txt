DOCTOR: Good morning, Chellsea. My name is Dr. Glowka. It's nice to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. Could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s… nice to meet you as well. Well, it’s about the cancer. I… I was told to come see someone. I don’t really know much about what’s going on, to be honest.
DOCTOR: I understand. It can be very overwhelming to receive news like that and then be told to come see a specialist. That’s perfectly alright. We’ll take things slowly and I’ll do my best to explain everything clearly. First, could you tell me who told you about the cancer and, if you know, what type of cancer they mentioned?
PATIENT: Um… it was Doctor Ramirez, at the hospital. He… he said it’s in my… my lung. He said the word… adenocarcinoma. Is that right? I think that’s how he said it. It’s a mouthful. I don’t… I don't know what that means, exactly.
DOCTOR: Yes, adenocarcinoma is the type of lung cancer Doctor Ramirez likely referred to. It’s a common type, and it originates in the mucus-producing cells in the lungs. It is a mouthful! To get a better understanding of your situation, and to plan the best course of action, I'm going to ask you a series of questions. It’s alright if you don’t know the answers to everything, we’ll get through this together. First, can you tell me when you first noticed any symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms… hmm. It’s hard to say. I was… pretty tired a lot, I guess. But I work a lot, and I just thought it was from that. Maybe… six months ago? I started coughing more, too. A dry cough. It didn't go away. That’s when I went to Doctor Ramirez. He did the… the scans, and then told me.
DOCTOR: Okay, so fatigue and a dry cough for approximately six months. Has the cough changed at all since it started?
PATIENT: It… it's gotten worse, I think. At first, it was just… annoying. Now, it hurts when I cough sometimes. And it’s… it’s harder to breathe when I’m doing things. Like, walking up the stairs. Or carrying things. Things I used to do without thinking.
DOCTOR: I see. So the cough is now painful and you're experiencing shortness of breath with activity. Have you noticed any other symptoms at all?
PATIENT: Um… well, I’ve lost some weight, I think. My clothes feel… looser. I haven't really been eating much, either. Not because I don’t want to, just… I don’t have much of an appetite. And… sometimes I have a little bit of… chest pain. Not a sharp pain, more of a… dull ache. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. Weight loss, decreased appetite, and a dull chest ache are all important things to note. Now, I'm going to ask a few questions about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any other medical conditions?
PATIENT: Not really. I… I had pneumonia when I was a kid, but that’s it. Oh, and I have… high blood pressure. But it’s controlled with medication. I take a pill every day. That’s all. I’ve always been pretty healthy, up until recently.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of pneumonia as a child and currently managed hypertension. Can you tell me what medication you take for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Let me think… It’s a little white pill. I… I can't remember the name. My husband always took care of refilling it. He… he passed away a few months ago, so I haven’t really been paying attention to things like that. I just… take it every morning. I can bring the bottle in next time, if that helps?
DOCTOR: Absolutely. Bringing the bottle in next time is perfect. We can also have the nurse help you get that information if you prefer. Now, have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, never. I’ve never had to have surgery. Just… the regular check-ups. And… the scans, of course. But no surgeries. I always thought I was too healthy for any of that.
DOCTOR: Okay, no prior surgeries. Now, thinking about your family, do you know of anyone who has had cancer?
PATIENT: Hmm… my grandmother, on my mother’s side, had… something. She passed away when I was young. I think it was… breast cancer. But I don’t really remember much about it. My mother didn’t talk about it much. And… no one else that I know of. Not that I’m aware of.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of breast cancer in your maternal grandmother. Now, I’m going to ask about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: No. Never. My husband smoked for a while, but I always made him smoke outside. I hated it. I always told him it was bad for his health. I… I wish he had stopped.
DOCTOR: Okay. And how about alcohol?
PATIENT: I… I have a glass of wine sometimes. With dinner. Maybe… three or four times a week? It helps me relax. I don’t drink a lot. Just one glass. Is that… bad?
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly fine, Chellsea. One glass of wine a few times a week isn't something to be concerned about. Now, are there any allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything. I eat everything. I used to love trying new foods, but… I haven’t really been hungry lately.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, I'd like to perform a physical exam if that's alright with you. This will help me get a better understanding of your overall health and assess your condition. It will involve listening to your heart and lungs, checking your lymph nodes, and feeling your abdomen. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s… alright. Whatever you need to do. I… I just want to know what’s going on. And what we can do about it.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I’m going to start by listening to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath in… and out… Okay, I’m hearing some… diminished breath sounds on the… lower left side of your chest. There's also some… mild wheezing. It’s subtle, but present. Now, I'm going to palpate your lymph nodes. This means I’ll be gently feeling for any swelling in your neck, armpits, and groin. I’m feeling some slight… enlargement of the lymph nodes in your left armpit. Again, it’s mild, but something we need to investigate further. Finally, I'll palpate your abdomen. Your abdomen is soft, but slightly tender in the upper right quadrant. Okay, that completes the physical exam. Thank you for your cooperation. Based on your history and the exam findings, I want to order some additional tests. We'll need a CT scan of your chest, abdomen, and pelvis to get a more detailed look at the cancer and see if it has spread. We'll also do some blood work to assess your overall health and look for any markers that can help us understand the type of cancer. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: That… sounds like a lot. But… yes. If that’s what you think is best, then yes. I just… I want to get this figured out. And hopefully… hopefully, there’s something we can do. How long will it take to get the results?
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety, Chellsea. It is a lot, and it's perfectly normal to feel overwhelmed. We’ll get through this together. The CT scans and blood work should take approximately 24 to 48 hours to be completed and the results sent to me. Once I have them, I will review them thoroughly and contact you immediately to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the findings and develop a treatment plan. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms – such as increased shortness of breath, chest pain, or fever – please contact the office immediately or go to the nearest emergency room. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No… I don’t think so. Not right now. I… I’ll probably think of some later. Thank you, Doctor. For explaining everything. And for… being so kind. I guess I’ll just… wait for the results. .
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Chellsea. Please don’t hesitate to contact the office if anything comes up, or if you simply want to talk. My team and I are here to support you every step of the way. I will have the nurse come in to review some written instructions with you and answer any questions you might have regarding the upcoming tests. Take care, and I’ll be in touch soon.
