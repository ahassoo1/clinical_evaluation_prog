DOCTOR: Good morning, Marialena. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Glowka. It's nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Glowka. It’s very nice to meet you as well. I’m here because I’ve been having some…well, pressure on my bladder. It’s been bothering me for a little while now.
DOCTOR: Okay, bladder pressure. I understand. And when you say “a little while,” could you give me a more specific timeframe?
PATIENT: Hmm…let me think. It started, I believe, around the beginning of June. So, about two months now, give or take a week. It’s not constant, but it’s frequent enough that it’s becoming a bit of a worry.
DOCTOR: Alright, about two months. And you mentioned it's not constant, which is good to know. Can you describe the pressure for me?
PATIENT: Well, it’s not painful, exactly. It's more like…a fullness, even when I haven’t just had something to drink. Like I need to go to the bathroom, but when I do go, it doesn’t always feel like I completely empty my bladder. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. A feeling of fullness and incomplete emptying. Have you noticed any other symptoms alongside this pressure?
PATIENT: Yes, actually. Now that you mention it, I have been going to the bathroom more often, especially at night. It’s disruptive to my sleep, which isn’t ideal. And sometimes, I experience a slight burning sensation when I urinate, though it’s not with every instance. It’s…intermittent.
DOCTOR: Okay, increased frequency, nocturia – that's the nighttime urination – and intermittent burning with urination. Have you noticed any changes in your urine itself – color, odor, or anything unusual?
PATIENT: Yes, a couple of times, I’ve noticed it’s been…cloudier than usual. And perhaps a slightly stronger odor, though I suppose that could be my imagination. I haven't seen any blood, thankfully. It’s just a subtle change in clarity and smell, really. It's not drastic.
DOCTOR: Alright, cloudiness and a slight odor change. Thank you for being so thorough. Now, let's go over some general medical history. Have you had any significant medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Not really. I had chickenpox as a child, of course, and a bout of the flu a few years ago, but nothing major. I've always been quite healthy, thankfully. My doctor always said I had a strong constitution. I do have seasonal allergies, but I manage those with over-the-counter medication.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. And have you ever had any surgeries or hospitalizations?
PATIENT: No, never. I’ve been very lucky in that regard. I haven’t required any surgeries or hospital stays, thankfully. I've always been able to avoid those sorts of things.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Now, can you tell me about your family medical history?
PATIENT: Well, my mother has type 2 diabetes, and she’s been managing it for about ten years now. My father had high blood pressure, but it was well-controlled with medication. On my maternal grandmother’s side, there’s a history of arthritis, but other than that, nothing major that I’m aware of. I don’t have any siblings, so there’s not much more to report, really.
DOCTOR: Thank you. And what about your social history?
PATIENT: Certainly. I’m married, as you know. I work as a graphic designer, so I spend a good amount of time sitting at a computer. I don’t smoke, and I rarely drink alcohol – maybe a glass of wine with dinner occasionally. I try to eat a balanced diet, though with work being busy sometimes it’s harder than others. And I do my best to get regular exercise, walking mostly, when I can.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. And finally, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, I don’t. I haven't ever had a reaction to any medication or food that I’m aware of. I’ve always been able to take most things without issue. Nothing comes to mind, at least.
DOCTOR: Okay, excellent. Now, let's proceed with a physical exam. I'd like to check your abdomen, and I'll also need to do a quick neurological exam and a pelvic exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s perfectly alright. I understand. Please, proceed as needed. I trust your judgment, Doctor. I'm a little nervous about the pelvic exam, naturally, but I know it’s important. Just…please be gentle.
DOCTOR: Of course. I will be as gentle and thorough as possible. Let’s start with your abdomen. Please lie down on your back, and I’ll gently palpate your abdomen. I'm checking for any tenderness or masses. Do you feel any discomfort in any particular areas as I press?
PATIENT: It’s…a little tender, actually, right here. Not painful, but noticeable. Like a dull ache when you press. And…maybe a little bit to the left side as well, though less so. It's not sharp, thankfully. Just…uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Okay, tenderness in the lower abdomen, primarily center and slightly to the left. I'm also listening to your abdomen with the stethoscope. Do you notice any changes in your breathing or any discomfort when I do this?
PATIENT: No, that’s alright. I don't feel any particular discomfort or changes in my breathing. It feels…normal, I suppose. Just listening. It doesn’t bother me.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, I'm going to check your neurological reflexes. Just relax your legs for me. Reflexes are normal. Now, for the pelvic exam. I will explain each step as I go, and please let me know if you feel any discomfort at any time. I'll be using a speculum and taking a sample for a urine analysis and a possible culture, to rule out any infection. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds alright. Thank you for explaining everything. I appreciate that. I’m a little anxious, but I understand it’s necessary. Please, proceed as you feel is best. I trust you. Just…try to be as quick and gentle as possible, if you wouldn’t mind. And let me know before you do anything, if possible.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I will be as gentle and efficient as possible, and I will explain each step before I perform it. I'm going to gently insert the speculum now. You might feel some pressure, but it shouldn't be painful. I'm examining the external genitalia now, looking for any signs of irritation or infection. Everything appears normal externally. I'm now taking a sample of cervical mucus. This will feel like a slight pinch. Okay, that's done. I’m now checking the position and size of your uterus. This involves gently palpating your uterus with my fingers. You may feel some pressure. Everything feels normal so far. The uterus is in the correct position and doesn't seem enlarged. And finally, I'm checking your pelvic muscles for any weakness or tenderness. Okay, that's all done. I'll remove the speculum now. Okay, that’s everything. The exam is complete. It's important to note that the external and internal examination appeared normal, although you did report some tenderness during palpation. I'll send the urine sample to the lab for analysis and culture. This will help us determine if there's an infection present. Do you have any immediate questions or concerns before we discuss next steps?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. That was…well, not pleasant, but I appreciate your gentleness and explanations. I was very nervous, so thank you for making me feel as comfortable as possible. I suppose my question is…what do you think it could be, if the exam didn’t reveal anything obvious? And what does the urine test actually tell you? I understand it rules out infection, but what else? I’m just…anxious to know what’s going on. I’m worried it’s something serious.
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety, and it's completely valid to be concerned. While the physical exam didn't reveal any immediate abnormalities, that doesn't necessarily rule out a cause for your symptoms. It's good that we have the urine sample for testing. The urine analysis will look for a few key things. Primarily, it will confirm or rule out a urinary tract infection – checking for bacteria and white blood cells. But it can also reveal blood in the urine, which we didn't see on the exam, but sometimes isn't visible to the naked eye. It can also test for glucose and protein levels, which could indicate underlying conditions like diabetes. And finally, we're checking for nitrites, which can also be a sign of infection. Given your reported tenderness and the frequency, nocturia, and the feeling of incomplete emptying, several possibilities exist. It could be a mild, low-grade infection that isn’t immediately apparent. It could also be an issue with your bladder itself – like overactive bladder or interstitial cystitis, which is a chronic bladder inflammation. Less commonly, it could be related to pelvic floor dysfunction. To further investigate, I recommend a complete blood count to assess for overall inflammation, and a post-void residual urine test. This involves measuring the amount of urine left in your bladder after you urinate, which can help us determine if you’re emptying your bladder completely. Depending on those results, we might consider a referral to a urologist for further evaluation. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds very reasonable, Doctor. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly. The blood tests and the post-void residual test make sense. I appreciate you not dismissing my concerns, and for taking the time to explore all possibilities. So, when can I expect to have those tests done? And how long will it typically take to get the results back? I’m just trying to manage my expectations and avoid unnecessary worry.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome. I'm glad I could provide some clarity and reassurance. We can order those tests today. The lab is located just down the hall, and you can go anytime before 4:30 PM. They’ll likely require a brief wait while they process the samples. Typically, the complete blood count results are available within 24-48 hours. The post-void residual urine test usually takes a bit longer, about 3-5 business days, as it requires a more specialized analysis. Once the results are back, we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them in detail and determine the best course of action. In the meantime, if you experience any worsening symptoms – such as fever, severe pain, blood in your urine, or inability to urinate – please contact the clinic immediately. I’ll also have the nurse provide you with a copy of the lab orders and some information about the conditions we discussed. Do you have any further questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. You’ve been incredibly thorough, Doctor, and I feel much more informed and less anxious. Thank you again for your patience and kindness. I will head down to the lab now. And I’ll be sure to contact the clinic if anything changes. Have a good day.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Marialena. I'm glad I could help. Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns. You have a good day as well.
