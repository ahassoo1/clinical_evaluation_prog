DOCTOR: Right. Mr. Schneer, is it?
PATIENT: Betty SCHNEER: Aye, that's me. Though most folks just call me Betty. It's been a while since anyone bothered with the 'Mr.' bit, truth be told.
DOCTOR: Very well, Betty. And what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Betty SCHNEER: Oh, well now… it’s me ears, I think. They ain’t what they used to be, that's for sure. People mumble a lot these days, or maybe it’s just me. I dunno. It’s hard to hear the television, and my daughter, bless her heart, she has to shout sometimes. It's just… quieter, everything.
DOCTOR: "Quieter," you say. Has this been a gradual change, or more sudden?
PATIENT: Betty SCHNEER: Oh, gradual, I reckon. Not like a bang, you know? More like… the volume knob got turned down little by little. I can't rightly say when it started, though. Years, maybe? It’s just… harder and harder to catch everything. Especially when there's a bit of noise around.
DOCTOR: Hmm. And are you experiencing any pain, ringing, or dizziness along with the hearing loss?
PATIENT: Betty SCHNEER: Pain? No, not a bit. Dizziness… sometimes, maybe. But I get a bit dizzy now and then anyway, even when I ain’t hearin' poorly. Old age, I suppose. Ringing… now, there was a bit of that a while back, but it’s gone now. Or maybe I just got used to it. It's hard to remember these things, you see.
DOCTOR: Right. And do you have any family history of hearing loss?
PATIENT: Betty SCHNEER: Family… Oh dear. Now that's a question. My brother, God rest his soul, he worked in the mills with me. Loud place, that. He always said his ears rang something awful towards the end, but I don't know if that was… well, just from the noise, or something else. Mom and Dad… I don’t recall them complainin' about their hearin'. Honestly, I couldn't rightly say. It was a long time ago, and nobody talked much about these things back then.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's have a quick look in your ears, shall we?
PATIENT: Betty SCHNEER: Oh, alright. Sounds sensible. Just be gentle, would you? My ears are a bit sensitive, you know. Old age again, likely.
DOCTOR: Hmm. There’s a bit of cerumen—wax buildup—in both ears. Nothing dramatic, but it could be contributing to the difficulty hearing. The tympanic membranes themselves look…normal. No obvious signs of infection or fluid. I'll need to perform a quick hearing test to get a better idea of the extent of the loss.
PATIENT: Betty SCHNEER: Cerumen, you say? Is that… ear wax? Well, I suppose that's not surprising. I never was one for stickin' things in me ears, you see. Always worried I'd do more harm than good. A hearing test, you say? Alright then. Whatever you think is best, dear. Just tell me what I need to do.
DOCTOR: Yes, cerumen is ear wax. It's quite common. The test is very simple. I’ll have you put these headphones on, and you’ll indicate when you hear tones in each ear. It won't take long. Just raise your hand when you hear something, even if it’s very faint. We'll start with your right ear.
PATIENT: Betty SCHNEER: Right ear, you say? Alright then. Now, just let me know if I need to shout if I don't hear anything. Sometimes I think I'm just getting old and daft, you know? Ready when you are, dear.
DOCTOR: Alright, that's enough for now. The test indicates you have a mild to moderate high-frequency hearing loss in both ears. This means you're likely missing out on some of the higher-pitched sounds, which can make it difficult to understand speech, especially in noisy environments. The wax buildup is also contributing.
PATIENT: Betty SCHNEER: Mild to moderate… high-frequency… Now, that sounds… complicated. So, I’m missin' the high sounds? Like… birds chirpin’ and whatnot? And the wax is makin’ it worse, you say? Well, that makes sense, I suppose. So, what does that mean? What can be done about it?
DOCTOR: It means you may have trouble hearing certain words, particularly those with ‘s’ ‘f’ and ‘th’ sounds. As for what can be done… we can remove the wax buildup—that’s a relatively simple procedure. And I would recommend a hearing aid evaluation. A hearing aid could significantly improve your ability to hear and understand speech. I can write a referral to an audiologist, who will perform a more comprehensive assessment and discuss the best options for you. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Betty SCHNEER: A… hearing aid? Oh dear. I always thought those were for folks who were completely deaf. I dunno… It sounds like a big step. Wax removal, aye, that sounds sensible. But a hearing aid… Would it… would it be very noticeable? And… would it be difficult to use? I don't have the best with newfangled gadgets, you see.
DOCTOR: They've come a long way, Betty. Modern hearing aids are very small and discreet – most people won't even notice them. And they're surprisingly easy to use. The audiologist will program it specifically for your hearing loss and show you how to insert, adjust the volume, and change the batteries. It's not like the old days. I can write the referral, and they can answer all of your questions and let you try different models. It's worth considering, even if just to see if it would help. I’ll also give you instructions on how to clean your ears properly going forward to prevent wax buildup. Do you have any other questions for me right now?
PATIENT: Betty SCHNEER: Well… if they’re really that small and easy to use… Alright then, aye. A referral would be grand. And thank you for explainin’ it all so patiently, dear. It's a bit overwhelming, you see. Old age, I suppose. I think that’s all the questions I have for now. I just need to… process it all a bit. And maybe convince my daughter I don’t need a whole new wardrobe to match the hearing aid.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Betty. I'll print out the referral and the ear cleaning instructions. Please don't hesitate to call the clinic if you have any further questions. And don’t worry about your daughter – I’m sure she just wants what’s best for you. Have a good day, Betty.
