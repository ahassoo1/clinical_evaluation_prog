DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Raghunathan. I am Dr. Paraskevopoulos. It says here you're with Medicare, and our location is in the city. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Yes, that’s all correct. I’ve been noticing a… well, a lump in my lower abdomen. It's been bothering me for a little while now, so I thought I should get it checked out.
DOCTOR: A lump in the lower abdomen, you say. And how long exactly has it been bothering you?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think… probably about three or four weeks now. At first, I didn't really pay it much mind, just thought it was something I ate, maybe. But it hasn't gone away, and it doesn't feel like something I ate, if that makes sense. It’s…firm.
DOCTOR: Three to four weeks. And you describe it as firm. Has the size of the lump changed at all during that time?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. I think… yes, it has gotten a little bigger, maybe? It’s hard to say for sure, it’s not like I’m measuring it every day. But when I first noticed it, it felt smaller, and now… well, I can feel it more easily, if that helps. It's not a huge change, though.
DOCTOR: I see. And is there any pain associated with it?
PATIENT: Not really pain, Doctor. More… discomfort. Like a dull ache, sometimes. It's not sharp or anything, and it doesn't happen all the time. Mostly when I'm… active, I suppose. Like if I'm doing a lot of moving around with my choreography. It’s not debilitating, but it's definitely noticeable.
DOCTOR: Choreography, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I’m a choreographer. It keeps me quite busy, as you can imagine. I work with a small dance company downtown. And, truthfully, I was starting to worry it might be affecting my work, if it kept growing. That's why I decided to come in.
DOCTOR: I see. And aside from the discomfort, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Let me think… no, not really. No fever, no weight loss, no changes in my… bowel habits, if you don’t mind me saying. I haven’t noticed anything else unusual. Just the lump and the occasional discomfort. I'm a pretty healthy person, generally.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any past medical problems that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No, not really. I had chickenpox as a child, and I broke my arm once when I was younger, but nothing serious. No surgeries, no chronic illnesses, nothing like that. My wife handles most of our medical appointments, honestly, so I don’t always remember the details. But I’ve always been quite healthy.
DOCTOR: Very well. And what about your family?
PATIENT: Hmm. My father had high blood pressure, I believe. And my mother… she had some problems with her stomach, years ago, but I don't recall exactly what. It was a long time ago, and we didn’t talk about it much. Nothing else that I’m aware of. Is that helpful, Doctor?
DOCTOR: It is… adequate. Now, are you currently taking any medications, or do you have any allergies I should note?
PATIENT: No medications at all, Doctor. And no allergies that I know of. I’ve always been lucky in that regard. I can eat anything, thankfully. My wife is the one with a slight sensitivity to shellfish, but that’s it.
DOCTOR: Very good. Now, Mr. Raghunathan, I'm going to need to examine you to get a better understanding of what's going on. If you'll please lie down on the examination table, we can begin. I’ll need you to disrobe from the waist down, and a gown is available if you prefer.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. That sounds fine. Yes, a gown would be preferable, thank you. Is there a changing room I can use?
DOCTOR: Yes, the changing room is just through there. Take your time, and call out when you're ready. I'll be right back.
PATIENT: Alright, thank you. I'll be just a moment.
DOCTOR: Now, if you could lie on your back, please, and relax. I'm going to palpate your abdomen to assess the lump. I'll start gently, and let me know if anything is painful. It’s located in the lower left quadrant. Approximately two centimeters in diameter. Firm, non-tender to superficial palpation. Mobile. No rebound tenderness. No guarding. No organomegaly detected. Bowel sounds are normoactive in all four quadrants.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. That doesn’t feel… too bad. Just a little… pressure. Yes, that's right, that’s the spot. It doesn't hurt, exactly, but it's… noticeable. And yes, that's in the lower left. I'm trying to relax… It's a little strange having someone poke around like this, if you don't mind my saying so. But if you need me to tell you anything, just ask.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s necessary to assess the characteristics of the mass. The location, size, and consistency are all important factors. Now, could you take a deep breath for me, and tighten your abdominal muscles?
PATIENT: Like this, Doctor? It feels… tighter now. Still no pain, but it’s definitely more prominent when I do that. Is that what you were looking for? It's a bit uncomfortable, but I can hold it for a moment.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s helpful. The mass remains firm and mobile, does not significantly increase in size with contraction. No evidence of hernias. Alright, Mr. Raghunathan, you can get dressed now. I'll be right back with my initial thoughts.
PATIENT: Alright, thank you, Doctor. I'll be ready in a moment. I appreciate you taking your time with me. It’s… reassuring to know you’re being thorough.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Raghunathan. Based on my examination, the mass is likely benign, however, further investigation is warranted to rule out other possibilities. I recommend an abdominal ultrasound to visualize the structure and assess its characteristics more accurately. I'll order that for you now, and we can schedule it for early next week.
PATIENT: An ultrasound, you said? Yes, that sounds… sensible. Early next week is fine. Is that… a long process, Doctor? And will it be painful? I'm a bit nervous, honestly. It’s just… never having anything like this before.
DOCTOR: An ultrasound is a non-invasive imaging procedure, Mr. Raghunathan. It does not involve radiation, and it is generally painless. A gel will be applied to your abdomen, and a transducer will be moved across your skin to create an image of the underlying structures. It takes approximately 20 to 30 minutes. I'll provide you with detailed instructions on how to prepare for the ultrasound. In the meantime, if you experience any significant changes – increased pain, fever, nausea – please contact the office immediately. Do you have any further questions at this time?
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds… much better. No pain, you said? That’s good. No, I don't think so, Doctor. Just…thank you for explaining everything so clearly. I feel a little less anxious now. I’ll be sure to call if anything changes. And I'll wait for the instructions about the ultrasound. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You are welcome. I will have the nurse provide you with those instructions before you leave. We will schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results of the ultrasound once they are available. For now, I recommend continuing your normal activities, but avoid any strenuous exertion that may exacerbate discomfort. Do you have any other concerns before we conclude?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think that covers everything. Thank you for your time and your thoroughness. I appreciate it very much. I'll see you next week, then.
DOCTOR: Very well. The nurse will escort you to the scheduling desk. Have a good day, Mr. Raghunathan.
