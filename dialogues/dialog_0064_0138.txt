DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Tofani. Welcome. It's nice to meet you. I'm Dr. Smetak. Now, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Smetak, is it? Well, it’s… it's a bit hard to explain, really. My daughter, bless her heart, she made the appointment. Something about… weakness? And headaches. There’s been a bit of that in the family, you see. My sister… oh, dear, what was it now… she had terrible headaches, and then… well, it’s all a bit fuzzy. I just want to make sure everything’s alright.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Tofani. It’s perfectly alright if it's hard to explain. We’ll take our time. Weakness and headaches… yes. Can you tell me a bit more about the headaches?
PATIENT: Oh, well… they’re not always there, you know? It’s not like a constant thing. But when they come… they’re a bit of a throb, mostly on this side… And sometimes, I feel a little… off balance, maybe? It’s hard to say. It’s not like falling down off balance, just… unsteady. And my daughter says I’ve been a bit… slow, sometimes? I don’t really notice it myself, but she worries so. She’s a good girl.
DOCTOR: Alright, unsteady and slow… and the headaches are mostly on the right side. When did you first start noticing these headaches and the unsteadiness, Ms. Tofani?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s a tricky one. It’s been… a few months, I think? Maybe longer? It’s all blurring together, you see. I’m 83 years old, Doctor! Things just… fade. It definitely wasn’t this bad in the spring, though. I remember a nice picnic in May… no trouble at all then. But since the summer heat… it’s been a little more noticeable, I suppose. And my daughter says it's been getting worse. She has a good memory, that girl. Much better than mine.
DOCTOR: Alright, so it sounds like it’s been gradually worsening, particularly over the summer. And no problems around May. Now, can you describe the weakness for me?
PATIENT: Weakness… It’s not like I can’t do things, you understand. I still cook, I still do a little gardening… but sometimes… my right arm feels… heavy? Like it’s harder to lift, you know? And sometimes my right leg feels a bit… clumsy. I haven’t fallen or anything, but it doesn’t feel quite right. It’s… intermittent. Comes and goes. It's not constant, like I said. Mostly when I'm tired, I think. Or after I've been on my feet for a while. Is that making any sense, Doctor? I'm afraid I'm not very good at explaining these things.
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Tofani, that makes perfect sense. Right-sided weakness, coming and going, worse with activity. That’s very helpful. Now, let's talk about other things you might be experiencing. Have you noticed any changes in your vision?
PATIENT: Vision… oh dear. Now that you mention it… sometimes things seem a little… blurry? Not all the time, mind you. Mostly when I'm looking to the side, I think. Or after I've been reading for a while. I wear glasses, you see, and I get them checked regularly. But it's not like a sudden change, or anything. Just a little… fuzziness, maybe? I thought it was just my old eyes getting older. Everything gets a little fuzzy when you get to be my age, you know.
DOCTOR: Alright, a little fuzziness, especially on the sides. Thank you. Have you had any difficulties with speaking or understanding what people say?
PATIENT: Oh, no, not really. I can still have a good conversation, can't I? I haven't had any trouble ordering my coffee this morning, thankfully! No, my hearing isn’t what it used to be, but that’s just old age, I think. Everyone mumbles these days. But my words… they all come out alright, I believe. My daughter would tell me if they didn’t, wouldn’t she? She's very observant.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear, Ms. Tofani. And yes, a daughter's observation is always valuable. Now, let me ask about any fever, chills, or night sweats you may have experienced.
PATIENT: Fever, chills… oh, no, not that I recall. I might have felt a little warm a couple of times, but nothing I paid much attention to. It's been so hot lately, you know? Hard to tell if it was a fever or just the heat. And no, no night sweats or anything like that. I sleep quite soundly, actually, all things considered. A bit of a creaky back gets me up once in a while, but that’s just old age again, I suppose. I’m not much help, am I? Everything just seems… normal, mostly. Just a little tired and a bit clumsy now and then.
DOCTOR: No, Ms. Tofani, you’re being very helpful. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Do you have any chronic medical conditions, like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Let me see… my doctor, Dr. Peterson, he’s retired now… he always checked my blood pressure, I remember that. He said it was a little high sometimes, but nothing to worry about too much. He put me on a little pill for it, years ago. I still take it. And… I had a bit of trouble with my heart a long time ago, maybe 20 years ago? I had some tests, and they said it was okay, but I don't really remember all the details. I think they said it was just a little flutter. And… oh, and arthritis. Yes, definitely arthritis. It's in my hands and knees, mostly. That’s why I'm a bit creaky, I suppose. Is that everything? It's all a bit of a blur, you see. My daughter keeps track of all these things, mostly. She’s very organized.
DOCTOR: Alright, so hypertension on medication, possible arrhythmia in the past, and arthritis. Thank you. Let me just access your chart here for a moment. Ah, yes. I see here you’ve been on Lisinopril for hypertension for several years, and there was an episode of atrial fibrillation approximately 10 years ago, treated with rate control medication at the time. And you do have a diagnosis of osteoarthritis. Good. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Allergies… hmm. I don't think so. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything, as far as I know. My daughter always tells the doctors if I'm allergic to something, so I trust her on that. I used to get hives when I was a little girl, but that was ages ago. I don't get them anymore. No, I don’t think I have any allergies. But I’m not entirely sure. She’s the one who remembers these things!
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. Good. And are you currently taking any other medications besides the Lisinopril?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see… I take a little white pill for my arthritis, it's… oh dear, what is it called? It's for the pain, you see. And sometimes, when my arthritis is really bad, I take… a little orange one. It helps me sleep. But that's only when I need it, you understand. And… Oh, and a vitamin D. The doctor said I wasn't getting enough sunshine. Is that everything? It's hard to keep track of everything, you know. She keeps a list, but I don't have it with me. She said not to change anything without talking to her, so I haven't.
DOCTOR: Alright. That’s very helpful. Let me just take a quick look at your chart here… Ah, yes. I see here you are on Ibuprofen as needed for arthritis pain, Trazodone for sleep, and Vitamin D 2000 IU daily. And you’ve been on Lisinopril 10mg daily for hypertension for several years. Now, let’s do a quick physical exam, just to get a better sense of things. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. Whatever you need, Doctor. You’re the doctor, after all. I trust your judgment. Just… be gentle, alright? These old bones aren’t what they used to be.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Tofani. I will be very gentle. First, let's check your blood pressure and pulse. Blood pressure is 140/85, pulse is 72 and regular. A little elevated, but not concerning given your history. Now, I'm just going to listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs noted. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Now, I'll just take a look in your ears and throat. Ears are clear. Throat is clear. Now, let's check your neurological function. I'm going to ask you a few simple questions. Can you tell me your name and today's date?
PATIENT: Oh, certainly. My name is Alayne Tofani. And today is… hmm. August… the second, I believe? Yes, August the second. 2025, isn’t it? Is that right? My memory isn't always what it used to be, you know. It's a bit fuzzy.
DOCTOR: That’s correct, Ms. Tofani. August 2nd, 2025. Good. Now, can you squeeze my hands?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. Is this alright? I don't want to squeeze too hard. I don’t want to hurt you, dear. Is that enough? It feels a little weak, doesn’t it? I haven’t been doing much gardening lately. My arthritis, you see. It makes it hard to grip things sometimes.
DOCTOR: That’s perfect, Ms. Tofani. Symmetrical and within normal limits, given your arthritis. Now, I’m going to ask you to stand up and walk a few steps for me, if you’re able. Just to assess your balance and gait. Do you need any assistance?
PATIENT: Oh, um… Well, I… I think so. Just a little. I’m a little unsteady, you see. My daughter says I shuffle a bit when I walk. It’s just… getting older, I suppose. But a little help would be nice, if you don't mind.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Tofani, that’s good. A little unsteady, as you mentioned, and a slightly wider gait. No significant asymmetry noted. Now, let’s have you sit back down. Alright. I’ve completed the physical exam. Overall, you appear generally well. Your vital signs are stable. I noted slightly reduced grip strength, a slightly wider gait, and a slight hesitation in your responses, but nothing acutely concerning at this time. Now, based on what you’ve told me and the exam findings, I'm considering a few possibilities, but I'd like to order some blood work and a CT scan of your head to get a clearer picture of what's going on. Does that sound alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, a CT scan? Is that… serious? Is something really wrong, Doctor? I’m not good with all these tests, you see. My daughter usually handles these things. She said something about… a stroke, maybe? She worries so much. But if you think it’s necessary… then I suppose so. As long as it doesn’t take too long. And… will it hurt? I get nervous easily, you see. But if you think it’s the best way to find out what’s going on… then yes, alright. Do what you think is best, Doctor.
DOCTOR: It's understandable to be anxious, Ms. Tofani. A CT scan is a very common test, and it doesn't usually cause any pain. It's like a more detailed X-ray. Your daughter is right to be cautious, and we want to rule out any serious causes for your symptoms, like a stroke, or other neurological conditions. It will take about 30-45 minutes, and we’ll have the results back within a few hours. We'll also do some blood work to check your overall health and rule out any infections or vitamin deficiencies. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Thirty to forty-five minutes… and blood work. That doesn't sound too bad, I suppose. As long as it’s quick. And… will I need someone to drive me home? My daughter usually takes me to these appointments, but she’s at work today. I don't like being alone, you see. Especially if I’m feeling a little… unsteady.
DOCTOR: That’s a very good question, Ms. Tofani. Given your slight unsteadiness, I would recommend having someone drive you home after the tests, yes. It’s best to be safe. If your daughter is unable to come, perhaps a friend or family member could assist?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Well, let me see… My nephew, Michael, he lives nearby. He might be able to help. He’s a good boy, Michael. He always offers to help with things. I’ll have to call him. Yes, I think he can. He’s off work on Wednesdays. Yes, alright. I’ll call him. That’s good. That’s very good. Now, what do I need to do next? Where do I go for the tests? And… will it be expensive? My daughter worries about the cost of things, you see.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I’m glad you have someone who can help. The tests will be done here at the clinic. The technician will come to get you shortly. We'll draw the blood first, and then you’ll go for the CT scan. As for the cost, we accept your insurance, and we’ll submit the claim for you. There may be a co-pay, depending on your plan, but we have financial counselors available if you have any concerns. I will have the nurse give you some written instructions and contact information for the counselors before you leave. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, that sounds very good. Written instructions… and financial counselors. That’s good. My daughter will be happy to hear that. She always takes care of these things, but it's good to know there's help available. So, the technician will come get me shortly? And I don't need to do anything special beforehand? I get nervous easily, you see. It's good to know what to expect. And… thank you, Doctor. For being so patient with me.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Tofani. No, you don’t need to do anything special beforehand. Just relax. The technician will explain everything to you. They will likely ask you to remove any jewelry or metal objects before the CT scan. That's all. I'm happy to help. Now, let me just have the nurse come in and give you those written instructions and the contact information. Nurse, could you please come in here for a moment?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Thank you, Doctor. Yes, alright. I'll just wait here then.
DOCTOR: We’ll get to the bottom of this, Ms. Tofani. Just try to relax while we wait. The nurse will be here shortly.
