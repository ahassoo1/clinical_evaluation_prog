DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Ruocco. My name is Dr. Paraskevopoulos. It is a pleasure to meet you. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Um… well, it’s this pain. When I take a deep breath, it hurts. It’s… hard to explain. It’s just… there. Not all the time, just when I… breathe deep. I don’t really remember when it started, to be honest. Things aren’t so clear these days.
DOCTOR: I understand. Pain with deep breathing. It’s helpful you’ve noticed it’s specifically when you take a deeper breath, that narrows things down somewhat. You mentioned it's not all the time. Could you describe the pain itself?
PATIENT: Describe it… hmm. It’s not a sharp pain, not like when I fell off the roof helping with the shingles years ago. It’s more of a… ache, I guess. A dull ache, right here… <points vaguely to his chest> It doesn’t go through to my back or anything. Just… in the chest when I try to fill my lungs. Is that making sense? I'm not good at explaining these things.
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Mr. Ruocco. You’re doing just fine. A dull ache localized to the chest, brought on by deep inspiration. And it does not radiate to your back. We will get to the bottom of this. Now, have you noticed anything that makes the pain worse besides deep breathing?
PATIENT: Worse… let me think. <pauses, looking up at the ceiling> Not really. Maybe… when I'm walking uphill? It feels a bit tighter then, the ache. But even then, it’s not bad. Just… more noticeable. I mostly try not to think about it, to be honest. It’s just… annoying. This whole thing is annoying. I got things to do.
DOCTOR: I see. Exacerbated by exertion, specifically walking uphill. And it’s primarily an annoyance. Alright. Now, to get a more complete picture, let’s briefly go through some general health questions. Have you had any significant illnesses in the past, Mr. Ruocco?
PATIENT: Significant illnesses… oh boy. That was a long time ago. I had the flu a few times, when the kids were little. And… I broke my arm once, falling off a ladder again! But big illnesses? Not that I remember. I used to be pretty healthy, always working, building things. I don't really go to doctors much. Never have. Is this going to take long?
DOCTOR: I understand you haven’t been a frequent visitor to the doctor, Mr. Ruocco. That's fine. But to properly assess your current complaint, it is important to have a complete medical history. Were you ever hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Hospitalized… hmm. Let me see. <taps his chin thoughtfully> I think… when I was a young man, maybe? Back in… Laos? I don’t remember exactly. Something with my leg, I think. A bad cut. It was a long time ago, a different life almost. They fixed it up, though. I don’t even remember the hospital name. It was… a hospital. Does that help? I'm sorry, I just don't recall details very well these days.
DOCTOR: A hospitalization in Laos for a leg injury. Vague recollection, unfortunately. Now, let’s move on to surgery. Have you ever had any operations or surgical procedures performed?
PATIENT: Operations… <shakes his head slowly> I don’t think so. No, I’m pretty sure I haven't. Not that I remember, anyway. Just the leg cut, and they stitched it up. That wasn’t an operation, right? Just… stitches. I did a lot of work with my hands, building things. Never needed much fixing myself, if you know what I mean. I'm a practical man. This is all getting a bit… tiring, if I'm honest.
DOCTOR: Very well. We will proceed. Now, Mr. Ruocco, could you tell me about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history… <pauses, looking distant> Oh, that’s a tough one. My wife… she passed a long time ago. We had children, of course. Good children. They all moved away. I don’t… I don’t really keep track of their medical things. They’re healthy, I think. As far as I know. My parents… they were farmers. Back in the mountains. They both… they both got old and… well, you know. Things happen. I don’t remember any special illnesses on either side. Mostly just… old age. I'm not very good with names and dates, Doctor. It all gets mixed up. Is this important?
DOCTOR: It is helpful to have some family history, Mr. Ruocco, but we will proceed without extensive details. Now, let’s talk about your current medications. Are you currently taking any prescription or over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications… <shakes his head firmly> No, no medications. Never really been one for taking pills. I prefer a good strong tea, if I'm feeling a bit under the weather. No vitamins, no supplements. Just… tea. And maybe some ginger when my stomach feels bad. I try to eat healthy, mostly. But I’m an old man. Things don’t always work the way they used to. I really need to get back to work, Doctor. I got a fence to finish building. It’s due next week. .
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, Mr. Ruocco, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or environmental factors?
