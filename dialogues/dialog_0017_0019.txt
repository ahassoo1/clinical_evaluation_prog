DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Carlotta. I am Dr. Blim. Now, let's get straight to it. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Um… my wife… she want… baby. We old, you know? She think maybe… need help? I forget things easy, so… she make me come. She say… plan. For baby.
DOCTOR: A baby, you say?
PATIENT: Yes. She very much want. But… I am… how you say… seventy years. Is okay? I not sure. She do all the talking, usually. I just… come with her.
DOCTOR: Mr. Carlotta, with all due respect, attempting conception at your age… presents a number of, shall we say, complexities. Before we proceed any further, let's establish some clarity. You mentioned your wife wants to pursue this. Is she with you today?
PATIENT: Ah… no. She at market. Get good mangoes, she say. Very important mangoes. She tell me ask… all the questions. She worry… about… everything, you know? I… think she want to know… is safe? For baby… and for her.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let’s begin with a review of your medical history. I need to understand your overall health status before we can even discuss the feasibility – and frankly, the wisdom – of such a plan. Do you have any pre-existing medical conditions?
PATIENT: Medical… conditions? Hmmm. Let me think. I get… little tired, sometimes. Old man tired. And my knees… they not so good. But I walk, I work with metal, you know? Make little things. She sell them. I think… no big problems? Doctor look at me, yes? He tell me.
DOCTOR: Please, have a seat on the table. A physical examination is necessary. "Little tired" and "knees not so good" are not sufficient medical history, Mr. Carlotta. We need specifics. But first, let's get a baseline. Remove your shoes and shirt, please.
PATIENT: Oh… take clothes off? Now? But… she say questions first! I… I not like take clothes off now. Is very cold in here. Maybe… just tell me… is okay for old man… to have baby? She very sad if… not possible.
DOCTOR: Mr. Carlotta, I assure you, I am perfectly aware that you are not eager to disrobe. However, a thorough examination is essential. It is not simply a matter of answering your wife's anxieties with a simple “yes” or “no.” We need to assess your cardiovascular health, respiratory function, and overall physical condition. Frankly, attempting a pregnancy at your age carries significant risks for both you and your wife—and potentially the child. Now, please, let’s proceed with the examination. It will be quick. And then, and only then, can we discuss the possibilities—or, more likely, the impracticalities—of this situation. Do you have any allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmmm. No. I think not. Maybe… dust, sometimes. When I work with metal. Make me sneeze. But not… bad allergy. I never take medicine for it. Wait… she say… something about… mangoes? She allergic to bad mangoes! Is very important, she say. Only good mangoes.
DOCTOR: Mr. Carlotta, with all due respect, your wife's preference for mangoes is not relevant to your medical evaluation. We are focusing on your health. Now, have you ever been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Hospital… oh. Years ago. Very long time ago. I fall off roof. Make little things, you know? On roof. But not so bad. Just… broken arm. They fix it. Long time ago. I forget how old I was. Maybe… forty? Fifty? It fix good, though. Still work with metal.
DOCTOR: And did you require any surgery during that hospitalization?
PATIENT: Surgery… yes. For arm. They put… metal inside? I feel it sometimes. Little bit of pain when cold. But doctor say is okay. He say… make arm strong. I work hard, so… maybe need strong arm.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Carlotta. Let’s move on. Have you ever had any serious illnesses, such as heart problems, diabetes, high blood pressure, or cancer?
PATIENT: Heart… no. Never. Strong heart, I think. Run around with kids when I young. Diabetes… no. I eat… sometimes too much sweet things, maybe. High… what you say? Pressure? No. I feel okay. Cancer… no. Never. She worry about cancer. She read things on the internet. Make her scared.
DOCTOR: Mr. Carlotta, I understand your wife’s concerns, but relying on information from the internet is rarely a reliable source of medical advice. Now, are you currently taking any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, or supplements?
PATIENT: No. No medicine. Just… tea. Sometimes. For tired. And… little bit of something for knees. She buy it. From the market. Old woman sell it. Good tea, good knees. No doctor medicine.
DOCTOR: Right. And finally, do you smoke, or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Smoke? No. Never smoke. Bad for lungs. My father… he smoke. Very bad cough. Alcohol… sometimes. With wife. Special occasion. Little bit of wine. Maybe… once a month? Just little bit.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Carlotta. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I need to perform a brief physical examination. Please lie back on the examination table, and we will proceed. It is important to note that given your age and medical history, attempting a pregnancy carries significant risks, and, frankly, is not generally advisable. But let's gather some data first. Please remove your shirt.
PATIENT: No… I still no like take clothes off. She say questions first! I want know… is safe? For baby… and for her? I want know… what you think. Before… before anything. Just tell me… is good idea? For old man… and old woman… to have baby? Please.
DOCTOR: Mr. Carlotta, I understand your apprehension, but I cannot offer a definitive answer without a proper evaluation. However, I will be frank. The likelihood of a successful, healthy pregnancy at your age is exceedingly low. The risks of complications—for both your wife and any potential child—are substantial. These include, but are not limited to, gestational diabetes, preeclampsia, chromosomal abnormalities, and stillbirth. Furthermore, the physical and emotional toll on both of you would be considerable. I strongly advise against pursuing this course of action. However, if you are determined to proceed, I will conduct a thorough examination to assess your overall health. But please understand, my assessment is not a guarantee of success. Now, are you prepared to proceed with the examination, or would you prefer I refer you to a specialist in reproductive medicine for a second opinion?
PATIENT: Second… opinion? What is that? Is another doctor? Maybe… yes. Another doctor… tell us same thing? Tell us no? Maybe… we just go home. Eat good mangoes. And… forget baby. She be sad… but… maybe is best. Is cold in here. I just want… to hold her hand. She very good woman.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Carlotta. If that is your decision, I respect it. I will document our discussion. Perhaps focusing on your wife’s well-being and enjoying your time together is the most prudent course of action. I wish you both good health.
