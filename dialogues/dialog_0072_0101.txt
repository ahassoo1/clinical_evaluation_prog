DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Popova. I'm Dr. Hembrey. It says here you’re 87 years young. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. Eighty-seven, yes, that’s right! Feels more like sixty most days, ha! Well, it’s this headache I’ve been getting. Right at the back of my head, you know? It’s been botherin’ me for a little while now.
DOCTOR: A little while… could you be more specific, Mr. Popova?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think… maybe about three weeks now? Started kinda slow, just a little ache. I thought it was just from bendin’ over doin’ nails all day, you know? But it hasn’t really gone away, and now it’s a bit more… insistent, if you get what I mean. It’s not the worst pain, but it’s there. Constantly.
DOCTOR: Three weeks, constant… and you do nails as a profession, correct?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. Manicures and pedicures. Been doin’ it for… oh goodness, nearly sixty years now! It keeps me busy, keeps me out of trouble, ha! But I do a lot of bendin' and lookin' close, so I suppose it could be somethin' to do with that. Do you think so, Doctor?
DOCTOR: It's certainly possible that repetitive strain is a contributing factor, Mr. Popova. However, a headache lasting three weeks requires further investigation. Are there any other symptoms accompanying the headache?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… hmm. Let me see. Not really. No fever, no blurry vision. I haven’t felt sick to my stomach or anything like that. Sometimes, when I’m really concentratin’ on a delicate design, I feel a bit… lightheaded, but that's happened for years. Just part of the job, I figured. It doesn’t happen with the headache, though. The headache is just… there. Dull ache, mostly.
DOCTOR: Lightheadedness… and you’ve experienced that for quite some time. Very well. Now, have you noticed any stiffness in your neck, or any pain radiating down your arms?
PATIENT: No stiffness in my neck, no. And no pain down my arms, thankfully. I need my hands for my work, you know! I’d be lost without ‘em. I can move ‘em just fine, do everything I need to. It’s just… this headache. It’s not a sharp pain, more like a weight on the back of my head. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It does, Mr. Popova. However, a persistent headache requires us to rule out other possibilities. Now, I’m going to need to ask you a few questions about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with high blood pressure or diabetes?
PATIENT: High blood pressure… no, not that I know of. Never been told. I go to the doctor for checkups every now and then, but they never said anything about that. Diabetes neither, thankfully. My mother had it, but I seem to have missed that one. I try to eat pretty healthy, you know? Lots of fish and vegetables. And I walk whenever I can. Keeps the old bones movin’.
DOCTOR: Very good. And are you currently taking any medications, prescription or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: No, not really. Just a little ibuprofen now and then for aches and pains, but that’s it. Doesn't really touch this headache though, to be honest. Not like it used to. I try not to take too much of anything, if I can help it. Never liked pills much. Bad taste in my mouth, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, I'm going to perform a brief physical exam, Mr. Popova. I'll need you to lie down on the examination table. We'll check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and assess your neurological function. Please let me know if anything feels uncomfortable during the exam.
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds sensible. Alright, let me just… …there we go. Neurological function… is that something to do with my brain, Doctor? I'm a bit worried now, to be honest. But I trust you, of course. Let's get it over with.
DOCTOR: It's a standard part of the evaluation, Mr. Popova. Just a routine check. If you’ll lie back, we'll begin. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs first. Please take deep breaths. Heart sounds are regular, but slightly rapid. Lungs are clear. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes. Reflexes are a little diminished, but within acceptable range for your age. Finally, I'm going to assess your cranial nerves. Eye movements are normal. Facial sensation is intact. Speech is clear.
PATIENT: Well, that wasn't so bad. A lot of pokin' and proddin', but not painful. What did you find, Doctor? Is it somethin' serious? You looked a bit… thoughtful while you were doin' all that. I do have a wedding anniversary comin' up, you know. Wouldn't want to miss that!
DOCTOR: Mr. Popova, your vital signs are generally stable, but your blood pressure is slightly elevated, and your reflexes are a little diminished, which can be common at your age. The neurological examination was largely normal, however, given the persistence of your headache and your slightly elevated blood pressure, I believe further investigation is warranted. I’m going to order a CT scan of your head to rule out any structural abnormalities. And I'd like you to have some blood work done to check your complete blood count, electrolytes, and thyroid function. While it’s unlikely to be anything serious, it’s best to be thorough, particularly given your age and the duration of your symptoms.
PATIENT: A CT scan… that sounds… serious, Doctor. Is it gonna hurt? And blood work… I don’t like needles. Will it show somethin’ bad? Is there anythin’ I should be preparin’ for? You’re makin’ me very nervous now. I just wanted somethin’ for the headache, not all this… Perhaps it is just bendin’ over too much, like I said…
DOCTOR: Mr. Popova, please try to remain calm. A CT scan is a non-invasive imaging procedure. You will simply lie on a table while the machine takes pictures of your head. It’s painless, although you may feel slightly claustrophobic. The blood work will require a small sample of blood, which is a minor discomfort. I understand your concerns, but these tests are necessary to determine the cause of your headache and ensure you receive the appropriate treatment. I'm not dismissing the possibility that it's related to your occupation, but we need to rule out other potential causes first. I’ll provide you with a referral to a radiology center for the CT scan and a lab requisition for the blood work. We can discuss the results at a follow-up appointment in one week. In the meantime, you can continue to take over-the-counter ibuprofen for pain relief, but please do not exceed the recommended dosage. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: A week… that seems a long time to wait when I have this constant ache. Okay, ibuprofen… I can manage that. And a week for the appointment. Alright. Do I need to do anything to prepare for the CT scan? Anythin’ special I should eat or drink? And… will they tell me the results right away, or do I have to come back again? I just… I don’t like bein’ poked and prodded and waitin’ for bad news. It makes my stomach churn.
DOCTOR: Mr. Popova, you don't need to do anything special to prepare for the CT scan. No special diet or fasting is required. The radiology center will review the images and send the report to my office. I will contact you to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results as soon as I receive them, likely within a few days. I understand your anxiety, but it's important to remember that most headaches are not caused by serious underlying conditions. The purpose of these tests is to provide us with more information, and allow us to make an informed decision about your treatment. Here are the referral slip and lab requisition. The radiology center is located at [provides address]. The lab is located at [provides address]. Please let the receptionist know you are here for a CT scan and blood work, respectively. Do you have any further questions at this time?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all for now. Addresses… right. I’ll need to ask my daughter to drive me, I suppose. It’s a bit of a trek. And I’ll try not to worry too much. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you takin’ the time to listen, even if it means a lot of pokin’ and proddin’ and waitin’. I’ll see you next week, hopefully with some good news.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Popova. Please do not hesitate to contact my office if you experience any new or worsening symptoms before your appointment. Goodbye.
