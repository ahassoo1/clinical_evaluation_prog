DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Sugino. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor Pehrson. Well, it’s… it’s a little hard to explain, maybe. I've been thinking about trying mindfulness, or meditation, actually. I hear good things, and… well, life gets a bit much sometimes, you know? I just don’t really know where to start, or even if it would help me.
DOCTOR: Mindfulness?
PATIENT: Yes, exactly. I think I’ve heard it called ‘being present’ too. People say it helps with stress, and just… calming things down inside your head. I work out on the tracks, fixing signals and switches – it can be a bit… tense, honestly. Lots of responsibility, making sure everything is safe. And I find myself worrying about things even when I’m not at work. It’s silly, I suppose. But I thought maybe this could help. Have you… heard much about it? Or do you have patients who try it?
DOCTOR: Look, Ms. Sugino, with all due respect, you’re in a doctor’s office. We deal with actual medical issues. Not… feelings. I mean, stress is…common. Everyone gets stressed. But coming to me for advice on meditation?
PATIENT: Oh. Right. I… I see. I hadn’t really thought about it that way. I suppose I just… well, I thought maybe you’d have some resources, or know someone who does. I’m sorry to bother you with something…unimportant. I just don’t know where else to turn, and you’re a trusted professional. I thought perhaps it was connected to… everything, you know? Being so worried all the time. It feels like a real thing to me. But you're right, it's probably not a doctor thing.
DOCTOR: Well, look. I can check your vitals, make sure there isn’t some underlying physical cause for your…anxiety. But realistically, this sounds like a…personal issue. Perhaps a therapist would be a better resource. I have a list of referrals I can give you. Now, let’s get down to business. Any actual medical complaints?
PATIENT: Yes, a list of referrals would be wonderful, thank you. I hadn’t even considered a therapist, to be honest. And no, nothing… physical, really. Just the worrying. Sometimes my sleep isn’t great, but I figured that was from the stress. It’s not like I’m sick, or in pain. Just…tired. And a bit overwhelmed, I suppose. The referrals would be really helpful, thank you.
DOCTOR: Here. Take a look. Mostly psychologists, a couple of counselors. Call around, see who takes your insurance. Now, just to cover the basics…any allergies?
PATIENT: Thank you so much, Doctor. I appreciate it. Allergies… hmm. Not really. I have a bit of a sensitivity to pollen in the spring, makes my eyes itchy, but that’s it. No medication allergies, thankfully. I’m pretty healthy, all things considered. Just… a bit worn down, maybe. From the tracks, I suppose. And the worrying.
DOCTOR: Any medications you’re currently taking?
PATIENT: No, nothing at all. I don’t like taking pills if I can avoid it, honestly. I try to stay active, eat well… mostly. I mean, it’s hard when you’re working long hours, but I do try. No prescriptions, no over-the-counter stuff regularly. Just… the occasional ibuprofen for a headache, if it gets really bad. But not often. Maybe once a month, if that.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let me just pull up your record here… you’re 47, height 161 centimeters, weight 136 kilograms, Medicare… Okay. Now, have you had any major surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Yes, you’re very thorough, Doctor. I had my appendix removed when I was about 18, a long time ago. Everything went fine, no complications. And… that’s it, really. I’ve been lucky. Just a few bumps and bruises from work over the years, nothing serious enough to require surgery. It's mostly just being careful, you know? And a good pair of boots. It sounds silly, talking about boots, but they really help.
DOCTOR: Okay. Family history?
PATIENT: Family history… hmm. My mother had high blood pressure, later in life. And my grandfather, on my father’s side, had… something with his heart, I think. It was a long time ago, and nobody talked about it much. But that’s about it, really. No major illnesses, no cancers or anything like that that I know of. My family tends to live a long time, thankfully. Although, maybe not always healthy lives, if you know what I mean. Lots of stubbornness and hard work, if that counts for anything.
DOCTOR: Alright. So… you’re here because you’re… stressed. No allergies, no medications, family history of… blood pressure and a vague heart condition. And you’re experiencing… difficulty sleeping. Is there anything else?
PATIENT: Yes, you've got it all correct. It sounds a bit… pathetic when you list it all out like that, doesn't it? Hmm… well, sometimes I feel a bit… disconnected. Like I'm going through the motions, but not really feeling anything. It’s hard to explain. Like a fog over everything. And I’ve been… less interested in things I used to enjoy. Meeting friends, reading, even working on my little garden. It’s not that I’m sad, exactly. Just… empty, I suppose. It's probably all the stress, isn't it? But it feels… different. I don't know. Sorry, I'm rambling. It's probably nothing.
DOCTOR: Look, Ms. Sugino, I’m going to be blunt. You’re describing symptoms that could indicate… several things. Including, and I’m just saying this because I have to, depression. Now, I'm not diagnosing you with anything. But these feelings, the disconnect, the loss of interest… these aren't simply “stress”. It's a bit more complicated than that. Now, I'm going to order some basic blood work to rule out any physical causes. But realistically, I think you need to seriously consider talking to a mental health professional. I gave you the list already. It's the best advice I can give you right now. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, I understand. Depression… I hadn’t really thought of it that way. It sounds…serious. But, yes, I suppose it makes sense. It’s just… I’ve always been a strong person. I fix things, I do things. I don’t… feel like someone who would be depressed. But if that’s what it is, then… okay. The blood work sounds sensible, of course. And I will… I will look at the list again. Thank you for being honest with me, Doctor. It’s… a little frightening, to be honest. But I appreciate you taking the time to explain things. So, blood work. And then… the list. Is there anything else I need to know right now?
DOCTOR: Okay. The blood work will just check your thyroid, vitamin levels, and basic metabolic function. It's standard procedure. I'll send the order to the lab, and they'll contact you to schedule an appointment. After you have the results, schedule a follow-up with me, and we'll discuss them. In the meantime, focus on getting some rest, and seriously consider making an appointment with one of those mental health professionals. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. You’ve explained everything very clearly, Doctor. Blood work, follow-up, the list… I will do those things. Thank you, again. For your time, and for being… straightforward. It’s not always easy to hear, but I appreciate it. I suppose I’ll… I’ll go and schedule the blood work now. Thank you, Doctor Pehrson. I will see you after the results come back. .
DOCTOR: Alright. Have a good day. .
