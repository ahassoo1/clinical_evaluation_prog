DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Trendler. My name is Dr. Octavis AX. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning to you too. Look, I don’t have all day, so let’s get on with it. It's about... well, lookin' at myself in the mirror, alright? Not happy with what I see. Things are droopin' and saggin' where they shouldn't be. You fix these things, yes?
DOCTOR: I understand. You’re concerned about some changes you’ve noticed in your appearance. We can certainly discuss that. To help me understand what's going on, could you tell me a little more specifically where you’re noticing these changes?
PATIENT: Specifically? You want specifically? Goodness me. Well, it’s the neck, mostly. All loose skin and wobbly. And then... the tummy, of course. Used to be flat, you know? Now it’s… well, it’s not flat. And maybe a little bit of the arms, too. Not much, but noticeable. You understand what I mean, yes? I don't want to be lookin' like an old bag, alright?
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand perfectly, Mr. Trendler. You’re concerned about skin laxity in your neck, abdomen, and arms. It’s common to experience changes in skin elasticity as we age. To get a better understanding of what might be going on, and to discuss potential options, let's go through a few questions. First, have you noticed any recent weight loss?
PATIENT: Weight loss? Not really. Maybe a pound or two over the last year, but nothing drastic. I eat regular, you know? Not a big eater, but I don’t starve myself. Always been a sensible man with his food. This ain't about weight, doctor. It's about… gravity, I think. That’s what’s doin’ it. Pullin' everything down.
DOCTOR: Okay, no significant weight loss. That's good to know. And you feel your eating habits haven't changed. Now, have you noticed any changes in your energy levels lately?
PATIENT: Energy levels? Hmmm… well, I ain't runnin' no marathon, if that’s what you mean. But I get by. I still do a little work, you know? Pile drivin' ain't easy, even if I ain't doin' it like I used to. I get tired, of course. Who doesn’t get tired at my age? But it ain’t a major thing, alright? I just… slow down a bit. That’s all.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you're still active with some work, but you’ve noticed a general slowing down. That’s helpful. Now, let's talk a little bit about your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions, such as diabetes, heart problems, or thyroid issues?
PATIENT: Thyroid? Heavens, no. Diabetes, not me either. Heart… well, the doctor told me a few years back my blood pressure was a little high, but I take a little pill for it. Keeps it under control, you know? And I had a bad knee once, years ago, but that’s fixed now. That’s it, really. Nothing major. I’m a strong man, alright? Always been healthy. Up until… this.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you have a history of high blood pressure, which is well-controlled with medication, and a previous knee injury that’s been addressed. That’s good to know. And just to be thorough, are you currently taking any other medications, vitamins, or supplements besides the blood pressure pill?
PATIENT: Let me think... Well, sometimes I take something for my arthritis, when it flares up. Just a little something the pharmacist recommends, you know? Nothing the doctor gave me. And… oh, yes! I take a multivitamin, every morning. For health, you understand. That’s it. Really. I don’t fill myself with all sorts of pills. Sensible man, remember?
DOCTOR: Okay, so a multivitamin daily and an over-the-counter medication for arthritis as needed. Good. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No, not really. Bit of a sniffle sometimes with dust, but that's all. Never been one for fancy foods, so haven’t had much chance to be allergic to anything. I stick to what I know, alright? Sensible.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Trendler. Thank you for that information. Now, to get a better sense of what’s going on with your skin, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. I’ll just take a look at your neck, abdomen, and arms. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Finally! Alright, alright, get on with it then. The sooner you tell me what can be done about all this saggin', the better. Just be quick, alright? I haven't got all day.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Trendler. I’ll be as efficient as possible. First, let’s take a look at your neck. Please relax your neck muscles for me. Okay, I’m noticing some degree of skin laxity, as you’ve described. There doesn’t appear to be any significant swelling or masses. Now, I’m going to listen to your thyroid. Thyroid sounds normal. Now, let’s move to your abdomen. Please lie back on the examination table. I’m noting some degree of skin laxity here as well. No tenderness to palpation. And finally, let's take a look at your arms. Please extend your arms out to the sides. Similar findings here - some degree of skin laxity. Okay, Mr. Trendler, that’s all I need for now.
PATIENT: Alright, alright. So, what does all that mean? Is it fixable, or am I just stuck lookin’ like this? Don't tell me it's just age, alright? I want solutions, not excuses. And try and keep it simple, I don't understand all that doctor talk.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Trendler. As you’ve noticed, there is some degree of skin laxity in your neck, abdomen, and arms. This is a common change that happens as we age, as the skin loses some of its elasticity and the underlying muscles lose some of their tone. Your previous knee injury and stable blood pressure are not contributing factors. It’s not simply “age,” but a natural process. Now, as for solutions, there are options, but it depends on what you’re hoping to achieve. Less invasive options include radiofrequency skin tightening and ultrasound treatments. These can help stimulate collagen production and improve skin tone, but results are often subtle and require multiple sessions. More invasive options include surgical procedures like a neck lift, tummy tuck, or arm lift. These procedures can provide more dramatic results, but they also come with risks and require a longer recovery period. Given your age and overall health, we would need to carefully consider the risks and benefits of each option. I would recommend a consultation with a board-certified plastic surgeon to discuss these options in more detail. I can provide you with some referrals if you’re interested. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: Plastic surgeon? Oh, heavens no. Surgery? Absolutely not! I ain’t stickin’ needles in myself, either. Is there anything… simpler? Anything that doesn't involve cuttin' or pokin'? I just want to tighten things up a bit, you know? Not lookin' for a whole new face. I'm a sensible man, alright?
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Trendler. You’re looking for something non-invasive and relatively simple. In that case, while the results won’t be as dramatic, we can explore some options to potentially improve skin tone and elasticity. Regular exercise, particularly strength training, can help build muscle mass and improve the appearance of your skin. A healthy diet rich in protein and collagen-boosting nutrients like vitamin C can also be beneficial. There are also some over-the-counter creams and lotions that contain ingredients like retinoids and peptides, which can help stimulate collagen production. However, their effectiveness varies, and they often require consistent use over several months to see any noticeable results. I would also recommend maintaining good skin hydration by drinking plenty of water and using a moisturizer daily. It's important to have realistic expectations, as these methods are unlikely to provide a significant transformation. But they can be a good starting point to improve the overall health and appearance of your skin. Do you think that’s something you’d be interested in exploring?
PATIENT: Exercise? I do a bit of work, like I said. And I eat alright. Sensible. Moisturizer? Fine. I can manage that. So, you’re sayin’ there’s no quick fix? No magic cream or pill to make everything tight again? Look, doctor, I appreciate you tellin’ me straight. I don’t want to be fooled. So, if those are the only options, I guess I’ll try them. But don’t expect miracles, alright? I’m a sensible man, remember? And I haven’t got time for wasting money on things that don’t work.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly understandable, Mr. Trendler. You’re right, there isn’t a quick fix. Maintaining a healthy lifestyle with regular exercise, a balanced diet, and good skincare is the best approach. I can provide you with some resources on strength training exercises and skincare products if you’d like. And I encourage you to be patient, as it often takes several months to see any noticeable results. We can schedule a follow-up appointment in three months to assess your progress and discuss any concerns you may have. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Three months, alright. Yes, that sounds… sensible. Don't bother with the fancy exercises, though. I’ll stick to what I know. Just give me the information on the creams, if you have it. And then… I guess I'm done here. Look, doctor, I appreciate your time. You’ve been… straightforward, which is more than I can say for some.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Trendler. It was my pleasure. I’m glad I could provide you with some clarity. Here’s a handout with information on skincare creams containing retinoids and peptides. Remember to start with a low concentration and gradually increase it as tolerated, and always wear sunscreen. If you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment, please don't hesitate to call the office. Take care, Mr. Trendler. And thank you for choosing me as your doctor. .
