DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Rowbottom. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Reisig. It’s a pleasure to meet you. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hmph. Well, it’s about my… business. Down there. I saw some red in the bowl this morning. Not a good sign, not a good sign at all. A man my age, you see, things start to… fall apart. Don’t need to hear about your fancy medical opinions, just want to know what’s going on.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Rowbottom. Seeing blood can certainly be alarming. We’ll get to the bottom of this together. To help me understand what’s happening, could you describe the blood you saw?
PATIENT: Describe it? What do you want me to do, paint a picture? It was red, Doctor. Like… well, like blood! Not a little drip, mind you, but a streak. A proper streak. And it wasn’t mixed with anything, if that’s what you’re getting at. Straight red. I haven’t been eating beets, if that’s what you’re thinking. A man knows his own body, you see.
DOCTOR: You're right to clarify, Mr. Rowbottom, and I appreciate you telling me that it was straight red and you haven’t been consuming anything that might cause that color. That’s helpful information. When you say a “streak,” could you estimate how much blood you saw?
PATIENT: Estimate? Honestly, Doctor, I don’t carry measuring cups in my… facilities. It wasn’t a Niagara Falls, if that's what you're asking. But it wasn't just a spot, either. Enough to make a man take notice, let's put it that way. A good teaspoonful, maybe? Though I haven’t exactly been… quantifying my bowel movements lately. It’s not a hobby, you know.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Rowbottom. A teaspoonful is a good estimate, thank you. And you're right, it's not a typical hobby. Has this happened before, or is this the first time you've noticed blood in your stool?
PATIENT: First time. Absolutely the first time. I’ve had… troubles, over the years, naturally. A man my age… but never this. Never red. Usually just… things not moving properly, if you catch my drift. But this is different. It’s unsettling. Makes a man wonder what’s falling apart now.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Rowbottom. It’s good that this is a new symptom for you. To get a better understanding of what might be going on, could you tell me if you’ve experienced any other symptoms alongside this, such as abdominal pain, changes in your bowel habits – like diarrhea or constipation – or any fatigue or weight loss?
PATIENT: Well, my stomach’s been a bit… rumbly, lately. Not painful, exactly, just… unsettled. And I haven't been sleeping as well. But that's just old age, isn't it? As for changes… I've always been… regular, let’s say. This hasn't changed that. And weight loss? I’m losing weight because I'm not eating as much! A man loses his appetite when he's worried about things falling apart! It's common sense, Doctor.
DOCTOR: You're right, those symptoms could be related to a number of things, and it's good you’re able to articulate them so clearly. The unsettled stomach and difficulty sleeping are certainly worth noting. Now, I'd like to ask about your medical history, if you don't mind. Do you have any existing medical conditions that you’re aware of, such as high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Hmph. Medical history. Doctors always want to know about medical history. Let's see… I had a bit of trouble with my heart years ago, back when I was flying the big jets. Nothing serious, they said. Just a bit of… irregularity. Fixed it with some pills, then stopped taking them. Been alright ever since. And no, no sugar sickness or anything like that. Always been a healthy man, despite everything. Always been able to handle myself.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Mr. Rowbottom. So, you had some heart irregularity in the past that was treated and resolved. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything other than that heart issue?
PATIENT: No surgeries. Never liked the idea of someone poking around inside me. Too risky. I broke my arm once, when I was a boy. Fell out of a tree. But that's it. Just a simple break. Healed up fine. And no, no hospital stays. I've always been too stubborn to be stuck in a hospital bed. A man needs his freedom, you see.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Rowbottom. It sounds like you’ve lived a very independent life. Now, could you tell me about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history? What good will that do? My father was a fisherman. Strong man. Lived to be eighty. Mother… she was alright. Died of old age, I suppose. No fancy diseases or anything. My brother… he had trouble with his stomach, years ago. Something about ulcers, I think. But he was a drinker. Always was. Probably that’s what it was. Can’t trust a man who drinks too much.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Rowbottom. That’s helpful information. So, your father lived to eighty, your mother died of old age, and your brother had stomach issues potentially related to alcohol consumption. Now, I’d like to ask about your social habits. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any other substances?
PATIENT: Smoke? Heavens, no. Never touched a cigarette in my life. Flying around all that jet fuel was enough smoke for one lifetime. As for drinking… a glass of wine with dinner, sometimes. Nothing more. And no, no other… substances. A man needs a clear head, especially a man my age. Keeps things… organized.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Rowbottom. That’s good to know. Finally, do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. Never had any allergies. I can eat anything. A man needs his strength, you see. Though I don’t eat as much these days… Still, no allergies. Never had any trouble with that.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Rowbottom. That gives me a good understanding of your overall health. Now, I'd like to perform a quick physical exam, if you don't mind. This will involve listening to your heart and lungs, and I'll also need to gently examine your abdomen and, with your permission, perform a rectal exam to check for any abnormalities. This is the most direct way to investigate the source of the bleeding. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: A rectal exam? Now hold on just a minute! You want to… poke around down there? Absolutely not! I haven't spent eighty-eight years keeping myself in order just to have someone… investigate things. I came here for answers, not… intrusions! What good would poking around do anyway? It’s just… undignified. I think I’ve told you enough. I want a diagnosis, Doctor, not a… a proctological examination.
DOCTOR: I completely understand your hesitation, Mr. Rowbottom, and I apologize if I’ve made you uncomfortable. You are absolutely right to express your concerns, and I would never proceed with anything you’re not comfortable with. A rectal exam is often the most effective way to determine the cause of rectal bleeding, but it is certainly not the only option. Given your reluctance, we can proceed with other tests, such as a stool test to check for blood and further investigate the source of the bleeding. However, please understand that without a physical examination, it may be more difficult to reach a definitive diagnosis. Ultimately, the decision is yours. Would you like to proceed with the stool test, or would you be open to discussing the benefits of a brief physical examination with a colleague present?
PATIENT: A stool test… that sounds… less intrusive. Yes, let’s start with that. A stool test. Get it analyzed. See what it says. No poking and prodding. That’s what I want. And no, I don't want to discuss it with a colleague. I've already told you everything. Just get the test done. Quickly, if you please. I haven't got all day.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Rowbottom. We can absolutely proceed with a stool test. I’ll have the nurse bring in the necessary collection materials. It's a fairly simple process, and the instructions will be clearly outlined. Once we have the results, we can discuss them and determine the next steps. It will take a few days to process the sample, so we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to review the findings. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: A few days… alright. Just make sure it’s done quickly. I don't want to be waiting around. And no unnecessary delays. Just get it done. And tell the nurse to be… discreet. A man has his dignity, you know.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Rowbottom. I will personally ensure that everything is handled with the utmost discretion and efficiency. I’ll have the nurse come in right away with the collection materials and instructions. In the meantime, is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No. That’s all. Just get the test done. And thank you… I suppose. Though I still think this whole thing is… unnecessary.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Mr. Rowbottom. We'll proceed at your pace and with your comfort in mind. I’ll have the nurse bring in the materials now. Please don’t hesitate to let me or the nurse know if you have any questions or concerns. Nurse, could you please come in with a stool collection kit for Mr. Rowbottom?
