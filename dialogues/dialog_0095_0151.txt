DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Uzarski. I'm Dr. Vanochten. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. It's nice to meet you too. Well, it's this tingling, you see. In my hands and feet, mostly. It's been going on for…oh, I don't even know how long now. A few weeks, maybe? It's just annoying, really. I need to get back to my route, if you don’t mind.
DOCTOR: A few weeks, okay. Annoying tingling in your hands and feet… I understand you’d like to be quick about this, and I'll do my best. To get a better idea of what's going on, can you describe the tingling a bit more?
PATIENT: Well, it’s not painful, exactly. More like… pins and needles, you know? Like when your foot falls asleep. But it doesn’t go away completely. It comes and goes, mostly when I’m walking. Or sometimes just sitting. It’s hard to explain. Is this something serious, Doctor? I really need to deliver these letters.
DOCTOR: Okay, pins and needles, like a foot falling asleep, that comes and goes with walking or sitting. And you're concerned about needing to finish your route. I understand. Does it happen in both hands and feet, or just one?
PATIENT: Both, mostly. My feet are worse, though. And sometimes it creeps up my legs a little bit. It’s funny… well, not funny ha-ha, but it’s worse at the end of the day, after I've been on my feet all day. Does that make sense? I walk a lot.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes sense. Worse at the end of the day, after a lot of walking… Okay. Do you notice anything that makes it better?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Sitting down helps, I guess. And when I first wake up, it’s usually not so bad. But as soon as I start moving… there it is again. I try to ignore it, honestly. I've got bills to pay, you know? Is it… something with my shoes? I wear the same boots every day. They’re comfortable, I thought.
DOCTOR: Okay, sitting helps, better in the morning, and worse with activity. And you're wondering about your boots. That’s good to consider. Before we jump to shoes, let’s get a little more information. Have you noticed any weakness in your hands or feet?
PATIENT: Weakness? Hmm… not really. I drop things sometimes, but I always figured that was just me being clumsy. I haven't noticed it getting harder to do things, if that makes sense. I still carry a heavy bag full of mail all day. It’s a lot of walking, but I'm used to it. I've been doing this job for… oh, a long time now. Is this… something old people get? I'm not that old, am I?
DOCTOR: No, you’re not that old. And many things can cause tingling, so let's not jump to conclusions. No noticeable weakness, just occasional clumsiness. Okay. Have you noticed any changes in your skin on your hands or feet – any redness, dryness, or sores?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. My hands get a little dry in the winter, but I use lotion. My feet… well, they sweat a bit in the summer, but that's about it. I try to keep them clean. I wear socks every day, of course. Is this something I should be worried about, Doctor? I just want to get back to work. People are counting on me.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern and wanting to get back to your route. We’ll figure this out. Let me do a quick exam, if that's alright. I'll check your reflexes, strength, and sensation in your hands and feet. That'll help me get a better idea of what's going on. It won't take long. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Oh… an exam. Alright. If it won't take too long. I really do have a lot of mail to deliver. And I don't want to keep other patients waiting. Just… be gentle, okay? My feet get tired easily.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I’ll be as quick and gentle as possible. Please lie down on the examination table. First, let’s check your reflexes. Please relax your legs. I'm going to tap on your knees with this little hammer. It might feel a little strange. Okay. And now your ankles. Good. Now, I’m going to check your strength. Can you squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: Okay, I’m trying to relax. My legs aren't what they used to be. Alright, squeezing… like this? I don't want to break your hand, Doctor! I have a pretty strong grip, even if I do drop things sometimes.
DOCTOR: No, that's fine. You're not breaking my hand! Good strength. Now, can you lift your feet up against my resistance, like you're trying to pull them up?
PATIENT: Okay, lifting… like this? Oh, it’s a little harder than it looks! My legs are tired from walking all day, I tell you. It’s a lot of miles.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s helpful to know. Okay, last thing. I’m going to lightly touch different parts of your feet with this little brush. Just tell me when you feel it. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Alright, touching… yes, that’s alright. Just be quick about it, okay? I'm a little ticklish, you know.
DOCTOR: Okay. I'm noticing some decreased sensation in your feet, particularly on the outer edges. It’s not drastically reduced, but it’s noticeable. Reflexes are a little diminished as well. Strength is good, but sensation is definitely affected. Based on what you've told me and the exam, it sounds like you may have peripheral neuropathy, which is damage to the nerves outside the brain and spinal cord. It can cause tingling, numbness, and weakness in the hands and feet. It’s often related to things like diabetes, but can also be caused by other factors. Do you have any history of diabetes?
PATIENT: Diabetes? Oh, no. Not that I know of. My doctor checks me every year, and he never said anything about that. I eat okay, I guess. I like my pierogi, but who doesn't? I don't drink much, and I don't smoke. Is it… something serious? Will I have to stop delivering mail? I need to deliver mail.
DOCTOR: Okay, no history of diabetes. That’s good to know. Peripheral neuropathy can have many causes, so it’s important to try and find the underlying reason. It's not necessarily serious, but it can be progressive if left untreated, and can affect your ability to do things. We need to rule out some other possibilities. I’d like to order some blood tests to check your blood sugar, vitamin levels, and kidney function. We may also want to consider a nerve conduction study, which is a test that measures how quickly signals travel through your nerves. Would you be open to that?
PATIENT: Blood tests… and a nerve what-now? Oh dear. I don't like needles, Doctor. But… if it helps me keep my job, I guess I can do it. What exactly is a nerve conduction study? Does it hurt? I really don't want anything that will keep me from delivering mail. People are counting on me, you know. And the bills… they don’t pay themselves.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns. The blood tests are routine – just a small sample of blood taken from your arm. It’s quick, and the discomfort is minimal. The nerve conduction study is a little more involved. It involves placing small electrodes on your skin to measure the electrical activity of your nerves. It might feel a little uncomfortable – a mild tingling sensation – but it shouldn't be painful. It's a non-invasive test. It'll help us pinpoint whether it's a problem with the nerves themselves. Let’s start with the blood tests. I’ll also give you a referral to a neurologist - a nerve specialist - for the nerve conduction study. It's best to get a specialist's opinion. In the meantime, I suggest trying to avoid prolonged standing or walking if possible, and wearing comfortable, supportive shoes. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: Okay, blood tests and a… neurologist. Supportive shoes, I can do. I've been wearing the same boots for years, maybe it is time for new ones. Will the blood tests tell me right away what's wrong? And... will I still be able to deliver mail while I'm getting these tests done? I can't afford to lose my job. My husband… well, he’s gone now, and I have to take care of everything.
DOCTOR: The blood tests will give us a good starting point, but it usually takes a few days to get the results back. We’ll contact you as soon as we have them. As for delivering mail, yes, you should be able to continue your work while you’re getting these tests done, as long as you're not experiencing any significant pain or weakness. But if you start to notice any worsening symptoms, please stop and let me know immediately. I'm writing you a referral to Dr. Anya Petrova, a neurologist at City General Hospital. Her number is 555-123-4567. You can call her office to schedule an appointment. Do you have any other questions or concerns I can address before you go?
PATIENT: Okay, Dr. Petrova, 555-123-4567. I wrote that down. I think that’s all for now. I just… I hope it’s not something serious. I really do need to deliver that mail. Thank you, Doctor. You've been very helpful.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Uzarski. I understand your concerns, and we’ll do everything we can to get to the bottom of this. Please don’t hesitate to call my office if you have any questions or if your symptoms worsen. Here’s a copy of the referral and some information about peripheral neuropathy. Get well soon, and please try not to worry too much.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. I will. Bye bye.
