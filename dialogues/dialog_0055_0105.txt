DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kochubey. I am Dr. Eaddy. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, can you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Um, it’s nice to meet you too. Right… well, I’m here about getting surgery, I think? For my weight. It's… something my wife and I have been talking about for a while now. Honestly, I don’t remember all the details, but it’s to help me lose weight.
DOCTOR: Surgery, you say. Hmm. Very well. It’s… commendable you are taking steps to address your health. Though, to be perfectly frank, simply wanting surgery isn’t a sufficient indication. We need to understand why you believe surgery is the best course of action, and if you’ve explored other avenues first. Perhaps you could elaborate on what your wife and you have discussed?
PATIENT: Yeah, that makes sense. I… it’s hard to remember exactly when we started talking about it. I think it was when my knees started really bothering me, and I couldn’t keep up with my son. He’s… eight, I think? We like to play soccer, but I was just… slowing him down. My wife, she did a lot of the research, to be honest. I mostly just… listened. She said something about… bariatric surgery? Is that right? She said it could really help, but I don’t… I don’t really know how.
DOCTOR: Bariatric surgery. Yes, a… rather drastic measure, often considered when other methods have failed. It’s not a decision to be taken lightly. Your wife's research is… helpful, I suppose, but ultimately, you must understand the implications. Before we proceed, let’s establish a baseline. Do you have any current medical conditions?
PATIENT: Medical conditions… hmm. Let me think. I get… tired easily, but everyone does, right? And my back hurts sometimes, especially after I’ve been on my feet all day at work. I sell things at the mall… shoes, mostly. I don’t think those are conditions, though. I haven’t been to a doctor in… a long time. Maybe five years? More? I just… try to tough it out. My wife keeps telling me I should go, but… I don't like doctors.
DOCTOR: “Toughing it out” is… a common sentiment, I find. Unfortunately, it often leads to more significant problems down the line. Fatigue and back pain can be indicative of a number of things, and ignoring them is… unwise. Five years since your last check-up… alright. Do you take any medications currently?
PATIENT: No, no medications. Never really been a pill person. Just… coffee, if that counts. Lots of coffee to get through the day. And sometimes, if my back really hurts, my wife gives me some ibuprofen. But that’s… it. I don’t take anything regularly. Honestly, I’m pretty healthy, I think… besides the weight, of course. And the knees. And the back.
DOCTOR: “Pretty healthy,” despite several complaints… I see. Well. Let’s move on to allergies. Do you have any known allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… let me see. Not that I know of. I eat pretty much everything. My wife always asks if I'm sure, but I've never had a reaction to anything. No hives, no trouble breathing… nothing. I think I'm good there. I do get bitten by mosquitoes a lot, but that’s not really an allergy, is it?
DOCTOR: No, mosquito bites are… not a medical allergy, Mr. Kochubey. Very well. Now, let’s discuss your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family history… that's… tough. My dad, he… he had problems with his heart, I think. He passed away when I was pretty young, so I don’t remember a lot of details. My mom… she’s still alive, but she doesn’t really talk about health stuff. She's more into gardening. I know my uncle, on her side, he has diabetes, but that’s about it. I don't really know much beyond that, sorry. It wasn't something we talked about much growing up.
DOCTOR: I understand. Family history can be… fragmented. Alright. Now, let’s discuss your social history. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: No, never smoked a day in my life. My wife hates it. And honestly, I don’t think I’d like it. It just seems… unhealthy. She’s very health-conscious, my wife. Always reminding me to eat my vegetables.
DOCTOR: Good. And alcohol consumption?
PATIENT: Uh… I have a beer sometimes. Maybe one or two on the weekends. Nothing crazy. Mostly with dinner. My wife will have a glass of wine. We don't really drink much during the week. It's more of a… relaxing thing on Saturdays. Definitely not a problem, I promise.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, let’s get some physical measurements. I’d like to check your height, weight, and blood pressure. And perhaps a brief examination of your knees, given your complaints. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds good. Whatever you need. Height, weight, knees… go ahead. I’m ready. I just hope it doesn’t take too long, I have to get back to the mall later. My manager’s been on my back about the schedule.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Please step onto the scale. And after that, I’ll need to take your blood pressure. Alright, your height is 155 centimeters and your weight is 139 kilograms. Blood pressure is 140/90. Now, let's take a look at your knees. Please lie down on the examination table. There is some tenderness upon palpation of both knees, particularly the medial joint line. Range of motion is… limited, and there’s a slight crepitus noted with flexion and extension. I suspect some degree of osteoarthritis, but further imaging would be required for confirmation. Alright, Mr. Kochubey. That completes the physical examination for now.
PATIENT: Okay… that sounds… not great. Osteo-what-now? Is that serious? And what does that mean for the surgery? Is it even possible with that? My wife said something about needing to be healthy enough for it.
DOCTOR: Osteoarthritis is a degenerative joint disease. Essentially, the cartilage in your knees is wearing down, causing pain and limited mobility. It’s… common, particularly with weight gain. It’s not immediately life-threatening, but it will progress without intervention. As for the surgery… bariatric surgery places significant stress on the body. It requires a certain degree of cardiovascular and respiratory fitness, and existing joint issues can complicate the recovery process. We need to determine the extent of the osteoarthritis before we can assess your candidacy. I recommend an X-ray of both knees to evaluate the cartilage damage. We may also consider a referral to an orthopedist for a more thorough evaluation. Do you understand?
PATIENT: X-rays… okay. Ortho… what was that again? And… does that mean I might not even be able to get the surgery? My wife… she’s really been looking forward to this. I just… I don’t want to disappoint her. I… I think I understand, but it's a lot. So, the knees… they could be a problem? Is there anything I can do now to help them, before we even think about the surgery? Like… exercises or something?
DOCTOR: An orthopedist is a specialist in musculoskeletal conditions—doctors who specialize in bones, joints, and muscles. They can provide a more detailed assessment of your knee condition and recommend appropriate treatment options. As for whether you’ll be a candidate for surgery… it’s too early to say definitively. We need the results of the X-rays and the orthopedist’s evaluation. In the meantime, yes, there are things you can do. Weight loss is paramount. Reducing the stress on your knees will alleviate some of the pain and slow the progression of the osteoarthritis. I recommend a low-impact exercise program, such as swimming or walking. Physical therapy could also be beneficial. However, it’s crucial to understand that exercise alone will not resolve the underlying issue. And frankly, based on your current weight, exercise will be… challenging. We need to address the weight first. I will write you a referral for X-rays and an orthopedist consultation. We will schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results and formulate a comprehensive treatment plan. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Okay… referrals. I’ll get those. And… weight loss. Right. My wife is always telling me that too. Um… I guess I just… what if it turns out I can’t have the surgery? What are my other options then? I mean, I’m already tired all the time, my back hurts, and I can barely keep up with my son. I just… I want to feel better. Is there… anything else I can do besides losing weight and seeing specialists? Some kind of… medication maybe? Or… a special diet?
DOCTOR: Let’s be realistic, Mr. Kochubey. Medication can offer some symptomatic relief, but it won’t address the root cause of your problems. Pain relievers can mask the discomfort, but they come with their own set of risks and side effects. And while a specialized diet may assist with weight loss, it requires discipline and commitment. If you are not a candidate for surgery, the focus will shift to managing your symptoms and improving your quality of life. This may involve physical therapy, lifestyle modifications, and, yes, potentially medication to control pain and inflammation. However, frankly, the most effective approach is weight loss. Reducing your weight will alleviate the stress on your joints, improve your cardiovascular health, and reduce your risk of developing other complications. I understand your desire for a quick fix, but there is no magic bullet. It requires effort, commitment, and a willingness to make significant lifestyle changes. I will provide you with information on local weight loss programs and resources. And I strongly recommend discussing your concerns with a registered dietitian. Do you have any other questions at this time?
PATIENT: Okay… I get it. No magic bullet. Just… hard work. I… I don’t think so. Not right now. I just… I need to think about everything you’ve said. And talk to my wife. She’s better at this stuff than I am. Thank you, Doctor. For everything. I guess I'll see you later, then. After the X-rays and… the orthopedist.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Kochubey. You may proceed to the radiology department to schedule your X-rays. And I will have my nurse provide you with the referral for the orthopedist. I expect to see you again soon.
