DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Cassimatis. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Alzoubi. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, my skin has been so itchy lately. It's driving me a little crazy, to be honest. Just…itchy all over. I haven’t changed anything – no new soaps, nothing like that.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Itchy skin can be very bothersome. And you said it’s all over, not just in one specific spot?
PATIENT: That’s right. Not just one spot, no. It's my arms, my legs, my back…even my scalp feels a little itchy. It's not a rash, exactly, just…constant itching. It’s been going on for a couple of weeks, I think. Maybe a little longer. Time gets away from me these days!
DOCTOR: Okay, a couple of weeks or so of generalized itching. And no visible rash?
PATIENT: No, no rash. Just…redness sometimes, if I scratch a lot, you know? But it doesn't look like anything, really. It just feels awful. Is this something serious, Doctor? I get a little worried sometimes.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern. It's good you're getting it checked out. Let's go through some questions to help figure out what might be going on. First, have you noticed anything that makes it worse or better?
PATIENT: Hmm…that’s a good question. Let me think. Well, it seems a little worse at night, maybe? When I'm trying to sleep. And hot showers don’t help. They feel good for a minute, but then it gets even itchier. Cold cloths…those feel a little better, for a bit. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s helpful. Worse at night and relieved temporarily by cold cloths. Okay. And have you had any other symptoms along with the itching?
PATIENT: Other symptoms…let me see. No fever, no weight loss…I haven’t been feeling tired any more than usual. Oh! Actually, now that you mention it, my appetite hasn’t been great lately. But I just figured that was because of the heat. It makes me not want to eat much, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, so no fever, no weight loss, appetite has been a little lower. Let's talk about your medical history, if you don’t mind. Do you have any medical conditions that we should be aware of?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Well, I had high blood pressure for a while, but it’s been pretty well controlled with medication for years now. And I had a hysterectomy a long time ago – maybe thirty years ago? Other than that, not much. I try to stay healthy. I used to walk a lot, but it’s been hard with the heat.
DOCTOR: Okay, well-controlled high blood pressure and a hysterectomy thirty years ago. And you take medication for the blood pressure, correct?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. I take a little pill every morning. Lisinopril, I think it’s called. I’ve been on it for…oh, I don’t even remember how long! A long time, definitely. And I take a vitamin D supplement too, the doctor told me I was low on that last year.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril and Vitamin D. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything. My mother always said I had a strong stomach! I eat just about anything, and I’ve never had trouble with any pills. That’s good, right?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s good to know. Now, just to complete the picture, can you tell me a little about your family history?
PATIENT: Oh, family history… Let me see. My mother had diabetes, but she lived to be 85, so it didn’t bother her too much, I think. My father had heart trouble. And my sister, she has arthritis. Nothing else really jumps to mind. It wasn't a family that talked much about health, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, diabetes in your mother, heart trouble in your father, arthritis in your sister. And lastly, do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, no, no, no. Never smoked a day in my life. My husband used to smoke, but he quit years ago. I have a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, maybe a couple of times a week. And definitely no recreational drugs! I'm a good, old-fashioned Puerto Rican woman.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's very helpful, Ms. Cassimatis. Thank you for sharing all of that information. Now, if you don't mind, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a better look at your skin and check for any other clues. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. Just let me know if it's going to be uncomfortable. I’m ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Cassimatis. I’m just going to listen to your heart and lungs, and then take a look at your skin. I'll start with your arms. Your skin is warm and dry. No obvious rash or lesions. Legs are the same – warm, dry skin. I do see some very faint scratch marks, consistent with itching. Back is clear as well. No rash or lesions noted. I'm going to palpate your lymph nodes now. Your lymph nodes feel normal - no swelling or tenderness. Everything seems normal on the initial examination, Ms. Cassimatis.
PATIENT: Well, that’s good to hear, Doctor. It’s just…so frustrating to be itchy all the time. Do you have any idea what it could be? Is it something serious? I really appreciate you checking me over so thoroughly.
DOCTOR: It’s good that the exam didn’t reveal anything obvious. It’s unlikely to be something serious, but persistent itching can have several causes. Given your history, and the lack of rash, we need to consider a few possibilities. It could be dry skin, even though your skin feels normal to the touch. It could be a mild allergic reaction to something you're not aware of. Or, sometimes, itching can be a side effect of medication. The Lisinopril is one possibility we should explore. I’m going to review your medication list and check for potential side effects. While I'm doing that, I'm also going to order some basic blood tests – a complete blood count and a comprehensive metabolic panel – to rule out any underlying medical conditions. We’ll also check your thyroid function, as that can sometimes cause itching. How does that sound?
PATIENT: That sounds…very thorough, Doctor. I appreciate you thinking of everything. Blood tests are okay, I guess. I don't love needles, but if it helps figure out what's going on, I’m willing. And checking the medication…that makes sense. I haven’t changed anything, but maybe something is still causing a problem. So, what do I do in the meantime? Is there anything I can do to stop the itching? It’s driving me crazy!
DOCTOR: Okay. To help with the itching in the meantime, I recommend keeping your skin well-moisturized with a fragrance-free lotion, especially after bathing. Avoid hot showers and baths, and use lukewarm water instead. Wear loose-fitting, cotton clothing. And try to avoid scratching as much as possible – I know that's easier said than done, but scratching can worsen the itching and lead to infection. I'm also going to prescribe an over-the-counter antihistamine – a non-drowsy type – to help relieve the itching. You can take that as needed. Here’s a prescription for cetirizine. And I'll have the lab results sent to me as soon as they're available, usually within a few days. We'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results and decide on the best course of treatment. Does that all make sense?
PATIENT: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Doctor. Moisturizer, cool showers, loose clothes, and the antihistamine. I can definitely do all of those things. Thank you so much for taking the time to listen to me and figure out a plan. It's a relief to know we're looking into it. When should I schedule the follow-up? And where is the lab?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Cassimatis. I’m glad I could help. Let’s schedule the follow-up for about a week from today, so we have time to get the lab results back. How does August 9th sound?
PATIENT: August 9th sounds perfect, Doctor. Thank you. And the lab…is it far from here? I don’t drive anymore, so I usually take the bus. I just want to make sure I can get there easily.
DOCTOR: The lab is just a few blocks from here, on Elm Street. It’s about a 10-minute walk, or you can take the number 22 bus – it stops right around the corner. I'll have the receptionist give you a printed map and the bus schedule before you leave. And here’s a copy of your lab order. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything, Doctor. You’ve been very helpful and thorough. I really appreciate your kindness. Thank you again. I guess I’ll go get the lab tests done and see what they say. Have a good day.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Cassimatis. I'm glad I could help. Please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. We'll get to the bottom of this. You have a good day as well. And remember, try to stay cool and avoid scratching! The receptionist will help you with the map and bus schedule.
