DOCTOR: Good morning, Lilyanna. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. VODZAK. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… pleasant to meet you as well. Um, well, it’s a bit difficult to explain, truthfully. I’ve been feeling… unsteady. Like I might fall over. It’s been happening for a little while now, and… honestly, I don't quite recall when it started, exactly. It’s frustrating.
DOCTOR: I understand. It is frustrating when things aren’t clear, and feeling unsteady is certainly concerning. Don’t worry, we'll try to get to the bottom of it. "A little while now"... can you give me a rough estimate?
PATIENT: Oh dear… a rough estimate… Let me think. It feels like… perhaps a few months? Maybe three or four? It’s hard to say. Things… don’t stick in my mind as well as they used to. It wasn't sudden, it just… gradually got worse, I think. I do remember noticing it more when I was at work, with all the… the drilling. Though, truthfully, everything at work is a bit of a blur these days.
DOCTOR: Okay, three or four months, gradual onset… and you mentioned noticing it more at work, with drilling. That’s helpful. Is the unsteadiness constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It… comes and goes, I believe. Some days are better than others. When I’m just sitting, or walking slowly, it’s not so bad. But if I’m trying to move quickly, or… when I have to concentrate really hard, like operating the drill, it gets much worse. It’s like my balance just… disappears. And sometimes, even when I am sitting still, everything just feels… wobbly, you know? It's a strange sensation.
DOCTOR: Yes, "wobbly" is a good way to describe it. And it seems to be exacerbated by activity and concentration. Do you experience any other symptoms alongside the unsteadiness?
PATIENT: Oh… other symptoms. Let me see. Hmm… Sometimes I feel a bit… dizzy, I suppose. Not a spinning dizziness, exactly, more like… lightheaded. And… occasionally, my vision gets a little blurry, but I always thought that was just from being tired. It's hard to tell what's connected and what isn't, really. I do find I get fatigued very easily these days, much more so than I used to. Is that… relevant?
DOCTOR: Yes, fatigue, lightheadedness, and blurry vision are all relevant. Let's try to build a more complete picture. Are you experiencing any ringing in your ears, any headaches, or any difficulty hearing?
PATIENT: Ringing in my ears… no, I don't think so. Headaches… occasionally, yes, but they’re not very severe. More like a dull ache, and they come and go. And… difficulty hearing… well, working around all that machinery at the oil rig isn't exactly gentle on the ears, so… yes, sometimes I have trouble hearing people if it’s noisy. But I assumed that was just the noise damage, you see? I suppose I haven’t really thought about it being connected to this… unsteadiness.
DOCTOR: That’s understandable. The oil rig environment certainly presents a lot of potential contributing factors. Okay, let's shift gears a bit. Do you have any known medical conditions, such as diabetes, high blood pressure, or thyroid issues?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… My late husband, bless his soul, always handled the medical things. I… I don't recall having any specific conditions. I had a check-up a few years ago, and everything was fine then, I think. But… I can't remember the doctor's name, or exactly when it was. I do take a multivitamin, if that’s helpful. And… I had surgery on my knee, a long time ago, after an accident, but that healed completely. It doesn’t bother me now. Is there… something I should be remembering?
DOCTOR: No, not at all. It’s perfectly alright if you don’t recall specifics. We can look up some records if you'd like. Just a few more questions. Are you currently taking any medications, besides the multivitamin?
PATIENT: Oh, no, nothing else. Just the multivitamin. I… I don’t really like taking pills, if I can avoid it. My husband used to say I was stubborn about those things. He… he used to manage everything, and I just… trusted him. It's foolish, I know, but I never really needed to worry about medications before. I’ve been quite healthy, generally. Until… recently, of course. Is this… a sign of something serious, Doctor? I apologize for being so… vague. It's just… my mind isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: You're not being vague at all, Lilyanna. It's perfectly understandable to feel anxious and unsure when you're experiencing new symptoms. And it’s common to feel a bit overwhelmed when reflecting on medical history. I assure you, we're taking things one step at a time. To try and get a clearer picture, let’s talk about your family medical history. Are there any conditions that run in your family, such as heart disease, stroke, or neurological disorders?
PATIENT: Oh dear… family medical history. That’s… difficult. My mother passed away when I was very young, and I didn’t know my father. My husband’s family… they were quite large, and I wasn't particularly close to them, so I don’t recall… much. He had a sister, I believe, but she lived far away, and we didn’t keep in touch. I don’t remember anyone having heart disease, or stroke, specifically. But… his mother, I think, had something with her… nerves? Something that made her… shaky? But it was a long time ago, and I wasn’t very close to her. I’m terribly sorry, Doctor. I wish I could be more helpful. It feels like… pieces are missing. It's frustrating for both of us, isn't it?
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Lilyanna. We’ll work with what we have. It’s common for family history to be incomplete. Now, let's discuss your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no. I’ve never smoked a day in my life. My husband… he used to enjoy a glass of wine with dinner occasionally, but I never cared for it myself. And… recreational drugs? Absolutely not. I… I lead a very quiet life, mostly. Work, and tending to the house. It's not a very exciting existence, I suppose. But it's peaceful. I used to enjoy gardening, but I haven't had much energy for that lately. Is that… relevant, Doctor? I’m starting to feel a little flustered, if I’m honest. It's all these questions… and my poor memory… it's quite overwhelming.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly alright to feel overwhelmed, Lilyanna. We're just gathering information, and everything you tell me is helpful. And yes, even your lifestyle is relevant. One final question about your background: Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… let me see. No, I don’t think so. I’ve never had a reaction to anything, as far as I know. I can eat anything, and I’ve never had any trouble with medications before. Although, I rarely take them, so I haven’t really had much opportunity to discover any allergies. Honestly, Doctor, I’m terribly sorry for being so unhelpful. It feels like… my mind is a blank slate. It’s frustrating for both of us, isn’t it? Perhaps… perhaps there’s something physically wrong? A vitamin deficiency, or… something else? I’m starting to worry that it’s something serious.
DOCTOR: You are not being unhelpful at all, Lilyanna. You’ve given me a lot of valuable information, and I appreciate you taking the time to answer my questions. It’s common to have difficulty recalling details, and your honesty is what’s important. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical exam. It will involve checking your vital signs – blood pressure, pulse, temperature – and doing a neurological exam, which will assess your balance, coordination, and reflexes. It’s a standard procedure and will help me get a better understanding of what’s going on. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. A physical exam seems like a good idea. I trust your judgment, Doctor. I’m… a little nervous, if I’m honest, but I’m willing to do whatever you think is necessary. I just want to find out what’s wrong, and… hopefully, get it fixed. Please, just… be gentle. My memory is a bit fragile, and I get easily flustered. And if I forget something, please don’t hesitate to remind me. I apologize in advance for any inconvenience.
DOCTOR: Of course, Lilyanna. We’ll take things at your pace, and I'll explain everything as we go. And please, don’t apologize—your comfort is my priority. Let’s start with your vital signs. Could you please sit here for me?
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. I’m ready, I suppose. Though… I do hope it doesn’t take too long. I tend to get… anxious in medical settings. It reminds me too much of… well, never mind. Just… please be gentle. I'm ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Alright, Lilyanna. Your blood pressure is 130 over 80. That's within the normal range. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Just breathe normally. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Now, let's check your reflexes. Your reflexes are a bit diminished, but that’s not necessarily cause for alarm. Now, I’m going to assess your balance. Could you please stand up slowly and try to stand with your feet together and your arms at your sides?
PATIENT: Oh dear… that’s… difficult. I don’t feel very steady, as you can see. Everything feels a little… off-balance. I’m sorry… I’m afraid I need to hold onto the table to avoid falling. It’s… embarrassing, really. I used to be so much steadier. I'm afraid my balance is worse than I thought. Is this… bad, Doctor? It feels rather concerning.
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Lilyanna. There’s no need to apologize, and it’s perfectly okay to hold onto the table. This is precisely why we're doing this exam—to gather information. I see that you do have some difficulty maintaining your balance, and that’s helpful to know. Now, let’s try a simple coordination test. I’m going to ask you to touch your nose with your index finger, then touch my finger with your index finger.
PATIENT: Oh dear… that’s… surprisingly difficult. My hand… it doesn’t seem to want to cooperate. I keep missing. I’m terribly sorry, Doctor. I’m afraid my coordination isn’t very good. It feels like… my hand has a mind of its own. I’m not usually this clumsy, I assure you. Is this… indicative of something serious? I’m starting to get quite worried.
DOCTOR: It's alright, Lilyanna. Don't apologize—this isn't a test of your abilities, it's simply a way for me to assess your neurological function. I do observe some difficulty with coordination, and combined with your reported unsteadiness and diminished reflexes, it raises some concerns. Based on my initial examination, it's too early to make a definitive diagnosis. However, your symptoms and findings warrant further investigation. I recommend a few tests, including an MRI of the brain to rule out any structural abnormalities, and a comprehensive blood workup to check for vitamin deficiencies, thyroid issues, and other potential underlying causes. Would you be comfortable proceeding with these tests?
PATIENT: An MRI… and blood work… Oh dear. That sounds… rather involved. Is it… painful? And expensive, I imagine? I… I have private insurance, thankfully, but I’m still concerned about the cost. And an MRI… is that a long procedure? I don't do well in confined spaces, you see. It sounds… frightening, honestly. But… if it’s necessary to find out what’s wrong, I suppose I have no choice. I just… I'm a little anxious about it all. What are we looking for, exactly? Is it something… serious? Please, be honest with me, Doctor. I’d rather know the truth, even if it’s not good.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Lilyanna. It’s perfectly normal to feel anxious about medical tests, especially when you’re unsure of what to expect. Let’s address your questions one by one. The MRI is not painful. You will lie on a table inside a large magnet, and it will take about 30-45 minutes. You'll need to remain very still during the procedure. We can discuss options for managing any anxiety you may have, such as medication or having a calming soundtrack during the scan. As for cost, your insurance should cover a significant portion of the expenses, but we’ll verify your coverage and provide you with an estimated cost breakdown beforehand. Regarding what we're looking for, the MRI will help us rule out any structural abnormalities in your brain, such as tumors, strokes, or inflammation. The blood workup will check for vitamin deficiencies—specifically B12 and D—thyroid issues, and other potential underlying causes of your symptoms, such as autoimmune disorders. It's too early to say definitively whether it's something serious, but it's important to investigate these possibilities to get an accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment. We're taking a proactive approach, and I want to assure you that we’ll be with you every step of the way. Would you like me to schedule these tests for you, and provide you with more detailed information about the procedures and associated costs?
PATIENT: Yes… yes, please. If you think it’s necessary, please schedule the tests. I suppose I have no choice. The sooner we find out what’s wrong, the better. Though… perhaps we could start with the blood work? I… I'm a little apprehensive about the MRI, to be honest. A confined space… it doesn’t sound pleasant. And could you… could you explain the procedure in more detail? What exactly will happen? And will I be able to… to speak to someone during the scan, in case I get… anxious? I just… I’m a little frightened, Doctor. It’s all a bit overwhelming. And please, send me the cost breakdown beforehand, so I can prepare. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your patience. It’s… comforting to know you’ll be with me every step of the way.
DOCTOR: Of course, Lilyanna. We can absolutely start with the blood work. It's a much simpler procedure, and we can schedule it for as early as tomorrow morning, if that works for you. Regarding the MRI, you will lie on a table that slides into a large, cylindrical machine. The machine makes a loud knocking sound during the scan, but we’ll provide you with earplugs or headphones. You’ll need to remain very still for about 30-45 minutes. A technician will be monitoring you throughout the procedure, and you’ll be able to communicate with them via an intercom. We can also arrange for a friend or family member to be present with you, if that would make you feel more comfortable. I'm now pulling up the lab order for the blood work and the MRI request form. I’ll send you the cost breakdown via email, as well as detailed instructions for each procedure. I’ll also include my direct phone number, so you can reach me if you have any questions or concerns. Is there anything else I can do to help ease your anxiety, Lilyanna?
PATIENT: That… that sounds… slightly less frightening, knowing there’s a technician present, and that I can communicate with them. And knowing my friend could be there… that would be… very comforting. Thank you, Doctor. The email with the cost breakdown and instructions would be… very helpful. And your direct phone number… that’s… reassuring. No, I don’t think so. Just… scheduling the tests, and knowing I’m not alone… that’s enough, for now. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very patient and understanding. I truly appreciate it. I suppose… I’ll see you tomorrow morning for the blood work? Is there anything I need to do to prepare for it? Fasting, or… anything?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Lilyanna. I'm glad I could help ease your anxiety. Yes, we have you scheduled for blood work tomorrow morning at 9:00 AM. Please arrive 15 minutes early to complete some paperwork. For the blood work, you'll need to fast for 8-12 hours beforehand, which means no food or drinks except water. You can continue to take your regular medications, unless otherwise instructed. I’ve emailed you all the necessary information, including the lab order, MRI request form, cost breakdown, and my direct phone number. Please don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions or concerns before tomorrow. And remember, you're not alone in this. We’ll work through this together. I’ll see you tomorrow morning, Lilyanna. Take care, and try to get some rest. .
PATIENT: .
