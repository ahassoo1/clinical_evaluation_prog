DOCTOR: Good morning, Kahrin. I'm Dr. Voytek. Welcome to the clinic. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just here for the results, if we can get right to it? I’ve got a pretty busy day.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I understand. Let me pull up your results here… Just give me one moment. Okay, so these came back yesterday. Before we jump into them, just to confirm, you were here on July 26th for some routine blood work and a check-up, is that correct?
PATIENT: Yep, that’s right. July 26th. Everything was fine then, as far as I remember. Just want to know what these new results say. Is it… bad?
DOCTOR: Well, “bad” is a strong word. There are a few things we need to discuss. Your complete blood count came back mostly normal, but your Vitamin D levels are quite low. Also, your TSH is slightly elevated. Do you know what those things are?
PATIENT: TSH… vaguely? Isn't that something to do with the thyroid? And Vitamin D… I try to get sun when I can, but I work indoors most days. Honestly, I don’t really follow all that stuff. What does it mean? Is it serious?
DOCTOR: You're right, TSH stands for Thyroid Stimulating Hormone. It helps regulate your metabolism. A slightly elevated level can indicate an underactive thyroid – we call that hypothyroidism. And you're right again about the Vitamin D – sunlight helps your body produce it, and working indoors can definitely contribute to a deficiency. It's good that we caught these early. Most likely, it's not serious serious, but it's something we need to address to make sure you're feeling your best. Do you have any symptoms like fatigue, weight gain, feeling cold often, or constipation?
PATIENT: Hmm… fatigue, yeah, always tired. I just figured it was the job. Weight… maybe a little, but I haven't really been tracking. And cold? I run a little cold normally, but nothing crazy. Constipation… sometimes. Look, honestly, those things happen, right? Everyone feels a bit off sometimes. So what’s the plan? Pills? More sun? I really can't spend all day on the beach.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful to know. It sounds like these symptoms could be related to the thyroid and Vitamin D levels. We definitely want to get a clearer picture before jumping to any conclusions. I'd like to order a more comprehensive thyroid panel – that will give us a better understanding of what's going on. And yes, increasing sun exposure would be beneficial if possible, but we can also discuss Vitamin D supplementation. Before we do that, let’s quickly go over your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any other medical conditions?
PATIENT: Nope. Nothing. Just the usual colds and flu. No chronic anything. Never been hospitalized, never had surgery. Pretty healthy, honestly. I eat okay, I try to exercise when I can. I just… feel tired a lot. That's it. This is all a bit much, to be honest. Can we just get a prescription for something and be done with it? I've got deadlines.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Kahrin, and I wish we could just jump to a solution. However, prescribing medication without a full understanding of the cause could be harmful. It's important to rule out other potential issues and ensure we're addressing the right problem. Let me ask a few more questions about your family history. Are there any thyroid issues, autoimmune diseases, or other medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… my grandmother, on my mother’s side, she had something… with her thyroid, I think. She was always tired, and she gained a lot of weight. I remember my mom talking about it when I was little. She took pills for it, I think. That was a long time ago, though. She passed away years ago. Other than that… not really. We don’t really talk about health stuff much in my family. It’s kinda… taboo. Is that helpful? Can we please move things along? I really need to get back to work.
DOCTOR: That is helpful, thank you. Knowing about your grandmother’s thyroid issues is important information. It increases the likelihood that yours could be related. Okay, one last quick thing. Are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Nope. Nothing. I don't like taking pills if I can avoid it. Just… coffee. Lots of coffee. Does that count? Seriously, is this going to take all day? I have a meeting in two hours. I just wanted the results, not a whole life story interrogation.
DOCTOR: Okay, no medications. And coffee doesn't count. I apologize if this feels like an interrogation, Kahrin. I assure you, I’m just trying to gather all the necessary information to provide you with the best possible care. Given your grandmother’s history, your symptoms, and the initial lab results, I do believe it's likely you have hypothyroidism. However, to confirm this, I'm going to order a full thyroid panel, including T4 and T3 levels, as well as thyroid antibodies. We'll also check your Vitamin D level again. In the meantime, I recommend trying to get some more sunlight if possible, and focus on getting adequate rest. We can discuss Vitamin D supplementation options after we get the results back. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Okay, fine. Full panel. Whatever. Just… can we do it quickly? And can I get a copy of the requisition form so I can just go straight there after this? I really don't have time to explain everything again. .
DOCTOR: Absolutely. Here you go. The lab is just down the hall, room 203. They’re used to taking patients from here. It usually takes a few days to get the results back, and my nurse will call you to schedule a follow-up appointment once they are available. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms—such as difficulty breathing, chest pain, or a rapid heartbeat—please seek immediate medical attention. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
