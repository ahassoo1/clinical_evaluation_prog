DOCTOR: Hi Louine, it’s lovely to meet you. I’m Dr. Georgiou. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, it’s about my foot. It’s been…troublesome. A sore, really. A nasty one. I’ve had it for a bit now, and it just won’t go away. And honestly, at my age, I don’t need this.
DOCTOR: Okay, a sore on your foot that’s been lingering. I understand. That is troublesome, especially when you’re trying to stay active. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Active? Hmph. I used to be active. Back when I could walk without feeling like someone was sticking needles in me. Anyway, it’s on the bottom of my foot, near my heel. It started small, like a blister, but it just got bigger and…deeper. And it hurts. A lot. It’s red, and sometimes it weeps. Honestly, it looks dreadful. I try to keep it clean, but it's hard to reach.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it’s on the bottom of your foot near the heel, started small like a blister, and has gotten bigger and deeper, causing you pain. You mentioned redness and sometimes it weeps, and it’s hard to reach to keep it clean. That gives me a good starting point. About how long has it been bothering you?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… It must be… at least three months now. Maybe longer. Time just…blurs, you know? I noticed it after I bought a new pair of slippers, but I don’t suppose that’s the cause. I’ve had slippers before. It just…appeared. And it hasn’t gotten better, that’s for sure. It’s just…stayed. A constant nuisance.
DOCTOR: Three months or longer, and it hasn’t improved, despite trying new slippers. Okay. It sounds like it’s been a persistent problem. And just to get a better picture, would you say the pain is constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Oh, it's not like a sharp, sudden pain. It's more of a dull ache, most of the time. But if I walk too much – and what is “too much” these days? – it really flares up. Then it's a throbbing, burning sensation. Makes me want to just sit and do nothing, which, frankly, I am doing more and more of. It’s a dreadful feeling, not being able to rely on your feet.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it’s mostly a dull ache, but flares up with walking into a throbbing, burning sensation. That’s helpful. Now, have you noticed any other changes in your foot besides the sore?
PATIENT: Well… now that you mention it, my foot has been a bit swollen. Not hugely, but if I compare it to the other one, you can see a difference. And it feels… warmer, I suppose. It’s probably nothing, just old age creeping in, but it’s there. And sometimes, my toes feel a bit… numb. A tingling sensation, you know? It comes and goes. I haven’t thought much of it, honestly. A lot goes wrong when you get to be my age.
DOCTOR: Okay, so swelling, warmth, and some tingling in the toes, all on the same foot as the sore. That's good information to have, thank you. Let's talk about your medical history for a moment, if that’s alright. Do you have any medical conditions, like diabetes or problems with circulation?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Diabetes. Type 2. Been dealing with that for… oh, decades, now. And the doctor always goes on about my blood sugar. I try, I really do, but it's hard to stick to a diet when everything tastes so much better with a little sugar. And I think he mentioned something about circulation once, but honestly, I don’t pay much attention to the details. Doctors use such complicated words. Is that relevant to this foot? Because if it is, I suppose I should have listened more carefully.
DOCTOR: Yes, diabetes is very relevant, Louine. High blood sugar can definitely affect your circulation and make it harder for wounds to heal, and also increase the risk of infection. It's good you told me. Do you take any medications for your diabetes, or for anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me see… I have a little bag full of pills. There's Metformin, for the diabetes, of course. And something for my blood pressure. Lisinopril, I think it's called. And sometimes I take Ibuprofen for aches and pains, but not regularly. It doesn't seem to do much good anymore, frankly. I have trouble remembering exactly when to take everything, though. It's all a bit of a blur, you know? My granddaughter tries to help, but she has a busy life.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you're taking Metformin and Lisinopril regularly, and Ibuprofen occasionally. It's understandable that keeping track of medications can be challenging. And do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm. Allergies… Not that I know of. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything. I used to get stung by bees when I was a little girl, but that was a long time ago. And I've eaten everything, practically. I don't have any food allergies, or anything like that. I'm a pretty sturdy person, really. Don't get sick easily, usually. Although this foot… this foot is a different story.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. That’s good. Now, I’d like to take a look at your foot, if you don't mind. Could you please take off your shoe and sock?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. It’s not a pretty sight, I warn you. There. As you can see, it’s not pleasant. And it’s quite tender, so be careful. I’ve tried to keep it clean, but it doesn’t seem to be helping.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see. Yes, it is inflamed and tender, as you said. I’m noting the location and size of the ulcer. It does appear deeper than a simple blister. I also notice some warmth to the touch. I'm going to gently check the depth of this wound. This might be a little uncomfortable, please let me know if it becomes too painful. It appears to be quite deep, and I'm concerned about possible infection. Okay, I’ve completed the exam. Based on what you've told me and what I see, it appears you have a diabetic foot ulcer. This is common in people with diabetes, especially if their blood sugar isn't well controlled. The ulcer is likely due to a combination of poor circulation and nerve damage, which makes it harder for your foot to heal. The redness, swelling, and warmth suggest there may be an infection present, but we’ll need to confirm that with some testing.
PATIENT: Infection? Oh, dear. That doesn’t sound good at all. I knew I shouldn’t have ignored it for so long. What sort of testing? And what do we do about it? Will I have to go to the hospital? I really don’t want to go to the hospital. It’s so cold there, and the food is dreadful. And frankly, I just want to get this sorted out so I can get back to my… well, back to sitting in my chair, at least. But still. I want my foot to feel better.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Louine. Let's take things one step at a time. The good news is, we can likely manage this without a hospital stay, if we catch any infection early. First, we need to determine if there is an infection present. I’d like to order a wound culture. This involves taking a small sample from the ulcer to see what bacteria are growing. We'll also do a blood test to check for signs of infection in your body. In the meantime, it’s very important to keep weight off your foot as much as possible. I'm going to prescribe a special boot to protect the ulcer and reduce pressure. We’ll also need to start a course of antibiotics, just in case there is an infection. I'm also going to refer you to a podiatrist, a foot specialist. They can help with debriding the wound—removing any dead tissue—and provide ongoing care. Do you have any trouble getting around for appointments?
PATIENT: A boot? Antibiotics? It sounds…serious. I suppose it is serious, isn’t it? I can manage the appointments, I think. My granddaughter can take me, if she’s free. She’s a busy girl, though, as I said. And what about the pain? It’s really quite uncomfortable, especially when I try to walk. Will the antibiotics help with that, or is there something else I can take? I don’t like to complain, but it’s wearing me down. And honestly, I’m worried about losing my foot. Is that a possibility? People lose feet, don’t they, with diabetes?
DOCTOR: It’s good you’re asking these questions, Louine. It is important to take this seriously, and we are going to address it proactively. The antibiotics won’t directly address the pain, but by treating any infection, they will help create a better environment for the wound to heal, which will ultimately reduce your discomfort. We can discuss pain management options as well. I can prescribe a mild pain reliever, and if that’s not enough, we can explore other possibilities. Regarding losing your foot… it’s a possibility, yes, but it’s not inevitable. With proper care—which includes controlling your blood sugar, keeping weight off your foot, regular wound care, and addressing any infection promptly—we can significantly reduce that risk. We will work together to prevent that from happening. I want you to understand that we are doing everything we can to help you. The podiatrist will be essential in this process. They can provide specialized care for the wound and monitor its progress. We'll also need to focus on controlling your blood sugar. Are you working with a doctor to manage your diabetes currently?
PATIENT: Yes, I see Dr. Abernathy for my diabetes. He’s…stern, I suppose you’d say. He always lectures me about my sugar intake. Honestly, it’s easier to just ignore him sometimes. But he does adjust my medication from time to time. I try to follow his instructions, but it’s hard. I have a sweet tooth, you see. And everything tastes so much better with a little sugar. I suppose I need to be more disciplined. I just don’t have the willpower, sometimes. I just want this foot to feel better. And I want to be able to walk without pain. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: No, Louine, that’s not too much to ask at all. And it’s perfectly understandable to struggle with making changes to your diet. It is hard, especially when you enjoy sweets. Dr. Abernathy sounds like he’s trying to help, even if his approach is a little stern. We can work together to find ways to manage your diabetes in a way that’s more sustainable for you. Perhaps we can discuss some resources to help with meal planning or finding healthier alternatives to your favorite treats. It’s about finding a balance, not deprivation. Okay, so we’re going to get you in to see the podiatrist as soon as possible. I'm going to write you a prescription for a wound boot and a mild pain reliever. I'll also send a referral to Dr. Abernathy, letting him know about the foot ulcer and requesting that we work together to optimize your blood sugar control. I also want to give you some written instructions on how to care for the wound, including how to keep it clean and protected. And please, don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns, or if your condition worsens. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. You’ve been very helpful, Doctor. And very patient with an old woman. I’m still worried, of course. But I feel a little bit better knowing that there’s a plan. And I suppose I should listen to Dr. Abernathy more carefully. It’s just…hard. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Louine. And please, don't think of yourself as "just an old woman." You’re a resilient person who’s been dealing with a lot, and I’m here to help you every step of the way. And yes, it is hard. But you’ve already taken the first step by coming in to see me, and that shows strength. Here are the prescriptions and instructions. Please call the office to schedule an appointment with the podiatrist, and don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions. We’ll get this sorted out together. Have a good day, Louine, and please take care. I’ll see you at your follow-up appointment.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too.
