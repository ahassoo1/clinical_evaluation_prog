DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Bahta. It’s a pleasure to meet you. I’m Dr. Petrimoulx. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is a pleasure to meet you as well. My name is Lonell Bahta. I am here today, as I understand it, to see if my mother is able to receive care at home. She is… quite elderly now, and it is becoming difficult to manage everything on my own. I believe you call it “Home Health” or perhaps “Hospice”? I was told to come and speak with you about this possibility.
DOCTOR: Thank you for coming in, Mr. Bahta. It’s completely understandable that you're looking into options to help support your mother. You’re right, we do offer both Home Health and Hospice services, and we can certainly discuss which might be the best fit for her needs. To start, could you tell me a little bit about your mother's current health situation?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Her name is Simone Bahta. She is… ninety-three years of age, as of last March. She has… several things going on, if I may be so blunt. Her heart is weak, and she tires very easily. She also has… what the other doctors call “cognitive decline.” She… forgets things often, and sometimes she is confused about where she is or who I am, which is… upsetting, naturally. And recently, she has been eating very little, and losing weight. It is all… quite a lot to manage, as you can imagine. Is that enough information to begin?
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Bahta, that’s a very helpful start. Thank you for sharing that with me. It sounds like your mother has a number of complex health needs, and it's admirable that you're taking such good care of her. Just to clarify, when you say “cognitive decline,” has she been formally diagnosed with anything specific, such as dementia or Alzheimer’s disease?
PATIENT: That is a good question, Doctor. She has been seen by a specialist… a neurologist, I believe they called him. He… spoke of something along those lines, yes. I recall the word “dementia” being used, but I confess, all the medical terms… they rather blur together. He did not give me a precise diagnosis, only that it was… a progressive condition, and to expect… further decline. I have all her records at home, if that would be helpful. Would you like me to bring them next time?
DOCTOR: That would be very helpful, Mr. Bahta, thank you. Having those records will give me a clearer picture of her condition and previous evaluations. In the meantime, could you tell me a bit about her current level of function?
PATIENT: Certainly. She… requires assistance with almost everything now, Doctor. She cannot dress herself, or bathe, or prepare meals. I assist with all of that. She is… mostly confined to her chair, or her bed. She can still speak, but… sometimes her speech is slurred, or she repeats herself. She is incontinent, I’m afraid. And she… needs constant supervision, as she sometimes tries to get up on her own and… falls. It is… very worrisome. I do my best, but it is becoming increasingly difficult.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Bahta. That sounds incredibly challenging, and you're right to seek support. It’s good that you're being so attentive to her needs. Given what you've described, it sounds like your mother could benefit from a comprehensive assessment to determine the best course of care. Both Home Health and Hospice have different criteria, so let's explore those briefly. Home Health is generally for individuals who need skilled nursing care, physical therapy, or occupational therapy while still actively pursuing treatment. Hospice, on the other hand, is for individuals with a limited life expectancy, focusing on comfort and quality of life. Do you have a sense of what her primary physician’s outlook is regarding her overall prognosis?
PATIENT: That is… a difficult question, Doctor. Her doctor… Dr. Moreau, is his name… he is… not one for direct statements. He speaks in… probabilities, and… avoids making firm predictions. He says her condition is “stable, for the time being,” but… he also says it is… “unlikely to improve.” He has prescribed medication to manage her symptoms, but… he does not seem optimistic about a long-term recovery. I believe he would… agree that her condition is serious, but… he does not want to… give false hope, perhaps. I hope that makes sense. It is… frustrating, to be honest.
DOCTOR: It does make sense, Mr. Bahta, and it sounds like a very typical approach from many physicians. It’s often difficult to give a definitive prognosis, and avoiding false hope is certainly important. The fact that her condition is stable for the time being, but unlikely to improve, does lean towards exploring Hospice as a potential option. However, we shouldn’t rule out Home Health entirely until we have a full assessment. To help me better understand her situation and determine the best path forward, I’d like to ask a few more questions about her medical history. Have you been informed about any specific diagnoses beyond the cognitive decline?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. She has a history of… heart failure, as I mentioned earlier. She had a… a rather significant heart attack… nearly ten years ago now. And she also has… diabetes, although it is… mostly managed with medication. She also… suffered a stroke… about five years ago, which… affected her speech and… some of her mobility. Oh, and… she has arthritis, quite badly. It causes her a great deal of pain, even with the medication. I believe those are… the major conditions. Is there anything specific you would like to know about any of those? I can try to recall the details, though I confess, it was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Bahta, that's very helpful. Knowing about the heart failure, diabetes, stroke, and arthritis gives me a more complete picture. Regarding the heart failure, do you know what her ejection fraction was at any point?
PATIENT: Ejection… fraction? I’m afraid I do not know what that is, Doctor. I apologize. I have all her medical reports at home, as I mentioned, but… I am not a medical professional, and… I do not understand all the terminology. I can bring the reports with me next time, if that would be helpful? Perhaps that information is included in those documents. I honestly do not know. I simply… take her to the doctor, and… administer her medication as prescribed.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Bahta. Don’t apologize at all. It's completely understandable that you wouldn’t know medical terminology. The ejection fraction is a measurement of how well the heart is pumping, and it’s often included in the cardiology reports. Bringing those reports with you would be very helpful. In the meantime, let’s move on. Has your mother had any recent hospitalizations or emergency room visits?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. She was hospitalized… about six months ago, with… pneumonia. It was a very frightening experience. She was… very weak, and… had difficulty breathing. She spent… nearly two weeks in the hospital. And… about three months ago, she had to go to the emergency room because of… a fall. She didn't break any bones, thankfully, but… she was quite bruised, and… became very agitated. They examined her, and… sent her home with… instructions to increase her supervision. Those are… the two most recent incidents, I believe.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Bahta. Knowing about the pneumonia and the fall is important. Falls can be particularly concerning, especially given her age and underlying conditions. Now, could you tell me a bit about her current medications?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Let me see… She takes… a medication for her heart, a small blue pill, twice a day. She takes… another medication for her diabetes, a white pill, once a day. She also takes… a pain reliever for her arthritis, a yellow capsule, three times a day. And… she takes a medication to help her sleep, a small green tablet, before bedtime. And… a medication for her blood pressure, a very small pink pill, once a day. She also takes… a vitamin supplement, a large multi-vitamin, once a day. I write all of the dosages down on a chart, so I can be sure she is taking the correct amount. Would you like me to bring that chart with me as well? It is… quite detailed.
DOCTOR: Yes, please do bring that chart with you, Mr. Bahta. That will be incredibly helpful. Knowing the specific medications and dosages is crucial. Now, just a few more questions about her general situation. Does your mother have any advance directives, such as a living will or durable power of attorney for healthcare?
PATIENT: That is… a difficult question, Doctor. I… believe she did something like that, many years ago. My father… he was the one who handled all those matters. He is… deceased now, and… I confess, I do not know where those documents are. I have never needed to access them. I simply… make decisions based on what I believe she would want. It is… all very complicated. I can… look for them at home, if you think it is important. I confess, I do not even know what a “durable power of attorney” is. I simply try to do what is best for her.
DOCTOR: It’s understandable that you may not know where those documents are, Mr. Bahta. A durable power of attorney is a document that designates someone to make healthcare decisions on your mother’s behalf if she is unable to do so herself. A living will outlines her wishes regarding end-of-life care. It would be helpful if you could try to locate those documents, but it's not essential at this stage. We can discuss that further once we have a better understanding of her current condition. Okay, Mr. Bahta, I think I have a good initial understanding of your mother's situation. Based on what you've told me, she has multiple chronic conditions, significant functional limitations, and a recent history of hospitalizations. To determine the best course of care, I’d like to schedule a visit to her home to assess her needs firsthand. Would that be possible?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that would be… very welcome. I would be… very grateful if you would come to the home to assess her situation. It is… difficult to transport her, and… she is most comfortable in her own environment. I can… arrange a convenient time for you to visit. Would next Tuesday afternoon be suitable? I can clear my schedule to be there.
DOCTOR: Yes, next Tuesday afternoon would work well for me, Mr. Bahta. Please provide me with your address, and a phone number where I can reach you on that day. Also, could you let me know if there are any pets in the home, or any other relevant information I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. My address is 14 Rue des Lilas, Paris, 75020. And my phone number is 01 43 56 78 90. There is… a small cat, named Mimi. She is… quite friendly, but… she tends to rub against people’s legs, so… you might want to be aware of that. And… the stairs are a little steep, so… please be careful. Also, my mother’s bedroom is on the second floor. Other than that… there is nothing else you need to know, I believe. I will… ensure everything is clean and tidy for your visit.
DOCTOR: Excellent, Mr. Bahta. 14 Rue des Lilas, Paris, 75020, and the phone number is 01 43 56 78 90. Noted about Mimi and the stairs—thank you for letting me know. I'll see you next Tuesday afternoon, then. I look forward to meeting your mother and discussing the best options for her care. In the meantime, if you think of any other questions or information you’d like to share, please don’t hesitate to call. Do you have any questions for me before we conclude?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I do not believe I have any further questions at this time. You have… been very thorough, and… I appreciate your patience and understanding. I am… relieved to finally be discussing this with a professional. I will… prepare everything for your visit next Tuesday. Thank you again for your time. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Bahta. I’m glad I could help. Don’t hesitate to call if anything comes up before Tuesday. I look forward to meeting you and your mother then.
