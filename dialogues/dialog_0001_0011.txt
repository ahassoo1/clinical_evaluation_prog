DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Honcoop. Look, I’ve got a pretty full schedule today, so let's get right to it. What brings you in here?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor... Pehrson, is it? Yes. Look, I need a… a permission slip. For somethin’ a fella wants to do. It’s about my face. A little… touch-up. Don't rightly recall all the details, but he says I need you to say it’s alright. Quick as you can, if you please.
DOCTOR: A permission slip?
PATIENT: That’s what he called it. A young man. Smart fella. Does… work with faces. Says you gotta check if I’m… strong enough? To not, uh… fall apart. I don't know. Look, I just want to get this done. I ain't got time for a lot of questions.
DOCTOR: Right. “Strong enough.” Well, Mr. Honcoop, you’re 64 years old and… significantly underweight according to my records. 52 kilograms?
PATIENT: Records, huh? Them things ain't always right. I feel… fine. Been workin’ with towers my whole life. Radio stuff, cellular, all of it. Keeps a man busy. What does my weight got to do with a little… fixin’? Honestly. A waste of my time, this is.
DOCTOR: Look, Mr. Honcoop, any procedure carries risk. And your current physical condition absolutely impacts that risk. Being severely underweight can affect your healing process, your ability to fight off infection… It’s not just about the “fixin’,” as you put it. Tell me, what exactly are you hoping to have done?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s just… a little saggin’. Under my chin. Gets in the way of things. He said somethin' about… liftin’ it. A small cut here and there. He showed me pictures. Real nice pictures. I don’t need a lecture on fightin’ off… germs. I’ve been around. Just tell me if I can do it or not, Doctor. That’s all I need to know. This is gettin’ ridiculous.
DOCTOR: “Liftin’ it.” Right. A submental lift, potentially with liposuction. And you want me to sign off on this with… a vague recollection of pictures and a hope for the best?
PATIENT: Look, I told you, I don’t recall details. I paid the man a deposit! A good deposit. And he said you just needed to check my… strength! My heart! Somethin’ like that. I ain’t a doctor! I fix towers. Now, are you gonna do it or not? I got appointments, you know. Important appointments. This is a complete waste of my time, and frankly, quite rude.
DOCTOR: Mr. Honcoop, I’m seeing… no prior medical history on file. No cardiac workup, no recent physicals. And you are, frankly, significantly malnourished. I’m not comfortable signing off on any elective procedure until we’ve established a baseline of your health. We need blood work, an EKG… at the very least. I’m not risking your wellbeing for a “quick fix” and a deposit you shouldn’t have paid without a proper consultation. I can order these tests for you, but I won't be authorizing anything until we have the results. Do you want me to proceed with the testing?
PATIENT: Testing? Blood work? Doctor, are you listenin’ to yourself? I came here for a permission slip, not a whole medical exam! This is outrageous. Absolutely preposterous. I’ll find another doctor. One who understands a simple request. You’re wasting my time, and I have better things to do. Good day. .
DOCTOR: Fine. Be my guest. But don’t come back here when things… don’t go as planned. And for the record, Mr. Honcoop, I am protecting your wellbeing, whether you appreciate it or not. .
