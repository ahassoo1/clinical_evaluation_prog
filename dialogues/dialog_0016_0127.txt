DOCTOR: Hi Gedalya, welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Maskal. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Well, it’s… it’s a bit difficult to explain. I’ve been feeling weaker, generally. And my eyelids… they feel heavy, and they’re drooping a little. It's been getting worse over the past few months, and I thought it best to get it checked out.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Weakness and drooping eyelids… that's definitely worth looking into. "Getting worse over the past few months" is helpful to know. Can you tell me a little more about the weakness?
PATIENT: Certainly. It started, I think, in my legs. Just feeling a bit more tired after walking, you know? Now, it's… well, lifting things is harder. Even climbing the stairs. It's not painful, exactly, just… takes more effort. And it seems to be spreading, if that makes sense. My arms feel it a bit now too. It's quite frustrating, to be honest.
DOCTOR: It does make sense, and it’s good you’re recognizing it’s spreading. “Takes more effort” is a good way to describe it. And no pain is also useful information. Just to get a clearer picture, when you say it’s getting worse, can you give me a rough idea of how much worse?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. It's hard to quantify… hmm. A few months ago, I could easily walk a couple of kilometers without much thought. Now, even a short walk to the shops leaves me feeling quite drained. And lifting groceries… I used to carry two bags, no problem. Now I have to make multiple trips, and I’m careful not to overdo it. It's a gradual thing, so it’s not like one day it was fine and the next it wasn’t, but… it's noticeable. I find myself thinking about it more and more, you know?
DOCTOR: I do understand – that sounds really frustrating. It’s good you’re paying attention to it. Okay, so gradual onset, impacting your daily activities… Let's talk about other things going on. Have you noticed any changes in your vision, besides the drooping eyelids?
PATIENT: Yes, actually. Now that you mention it… my vision is sometimes a bit blurry, especially at the end of the day. I put it down to being tired, to be honest, but it is more frequent now. And… occasionally, things seem a little double. It doesn't happen all the time, just… now and then. It's fleeting, though. It's hard to explain. It's not constant double vision, just… a sort of wavering.
DOCTOR: Okay, blurry vision and intermittent double vision... that's important to note. "Fleeting" and "wavering" helps me understand the nature of it. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms at all?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I've been a bit more… tired than usual, generally. Not just from the walking, but… a sort of all-over fatigue. And… I’ve been having some difficulty swallowing sometimes. It's not severe, but food sometimes feels like it’s sticking a little. It’s probably just a coincidence, but I thought I should mention it. It happens maybe once or twice a week. And… oh, my speech feels a little slurred sometimes, towards the end of the day as well. It’s subtle, I don’t think anyone else would notice.
DOCTOR: Okay, so fatigue, difficulty swallowing a couple of times a week, and subtle slurred speech... That's quite a bit of information, Gedalya, thank you for being so thorough. Let’s switch gears a bit. Do you have any past medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No, not really. I’ve always been quite healthy, to be honest. I had the usual childhood illnesses, but nothing serious. No major operations or anything like that. I did have a bout of the flu last winter, but that was it. I don't take any regular medication, either. Just the occasional painkiller for a headache, if needed.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. No significant medical history. And you mentioned no regular medications, just occasional painkillers. What about family history?
PATIENT: That's a bit… complicated. My mother passed away a few years ago, from… well, it was a long illness, something to do with her nerves, I think. My father is still alive, but we’re not very close. I don’t really know much about his medical history, to be honest. He never talked about it. As far as I know, there’s nothing significant on either side of the family, but… I wouldn’t swear to it. It's not something we discussed much.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Mother passed away from a nerve-related illness, and limited knowledge of your father’s medical history. That's alright – we can work with what we have. Let's talk about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, none of those. I don't smoke, I very rarely drink alcohol – perhaps a glass of wine with dinner occasionally, but it’s not a habit. And I certainly don’t use any recreational drugs. I try to eat a healthy diet, though I admit I haven’t been very good at it lately, with everything going on. And I try to get some exercise when I can, but… it’s been difficult recently, with the weakness.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. No smoking, minimal alcohol, no recreational drugs, trying to eat healthy. And just one final set of questions for now, Gedalya. Do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I’m aware of. I’ve never had any allergic reactions to anything. I’ve had vaccinations, of course, as a child, and the usual boosters, but nothing serious. No known allergies at all. I don’t have any sensitivities to foods or anything like that either.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. That's very helpful, Gedalya. Thank you for providing me with all of this information. Alright, Gedalya, based on what you've told me, and reviewing your chart here, I think we need to investigate this further. Your symptoms – the weakness, drooping eyelids, blurry vision, difficulty swallowing, slurred speech – are concerning. They could be related to a number of things, and we need to rule some things out. I'd like to do a physical exam now, and then potentially order some blood tests and possibly some imaging. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly reasonable, Doctor. I trust your judgment. A physical exam and some tests… whatever you think is best. I just want to find out what’s going on, and hopefully get it sorted out. I’m a little worried, to be honest, but I appreciate you taking the time to listen. So, yes, please, let’s proceed with the exam and the tests.
DOCTOR: Of course. It’s good you’re being proactive, and it’s perfectly normal to be worried. We'll take things one step at a time. Okay, let's start with the physical exam. I'm going to check your vital signs – blood pressure, pulse, temperature. Then I'll listen to your heart and lungs, and check your reflexes. I'll also examine your eyes, including your pupils and your eye movements. And I'll do a neurological exam to assess your strength, coordination, and sensation. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine, Doctor. I understand. Please, proceed. I’ll just… try to relax. It's probably easier said than done, but I'll do my best. Let me know if there’s anything I need to do.
DOCTOR: Okay, blood pressure is 130/80, pulse is 72 and regular. Temperature is normal at 98.6 Fahrenheit. Heart sounds are normal, no murmurs. Lungs are clear to auscultation, no wheezes or crackles. Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light. Eye movements are full and smooth, but I do notice a slight nystagmus – a slight involuntary shaking – in both eyes, particularly when he looks to the extremes of gaze. I’ll document that. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes. I’m going to ask you to relax your arm, and I’ll tap your tendon with this small hammer. Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally, which is normal. Now, I’m going to assess your strength. I’m going to ask you to squeeze my hands as hard as you can, and then I’ll try to resist your effort. Strength is 5 out of 5 in both arms, but I notice some weakness in his legs – around 4 out of 5. I’ll document that as well. And there’s some mild atrophy – some muscle wasting – in his calves. Finally, I’m going to check your sensation. I’m going to lightly touch your skin with this cotton swab, and you tell me when you feel it. Sensation is intact, but diminished slightly in his lower extremities. Okay, that completes the physical exam. I’ve noted the nystagmus, weakness in his legs, mild atrophy in his calves, and diminished sensation in his lower extremities. I’ll document all of this thoroughly. Based on your history and the exam findings, I'm concerned about possible neurological involvement. We need to investigate further with some blood tests and potentially an MRI of the brain and spinal cord. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… thorough, Doctor. And frankly, it sounds necessary. If you think an MRI is needed, then absolutely. Blood tests and an MRI… whatever it takes to figure out what’s going on. I’m a little worried about what it could be, but I trust your judgment. I’ll need some time to process all of that, I suppose. What kind of blood tests are you thinking of? And… how long would it take to get the MRI scheduled?
DOCTOR: It's good you're letting me know how you're feeling. It's definitely a lot to take in. The blood tests I'm thinking of will include a complete blood count to check for any signs of infection or anemia, a metabolic panel to assess your kidney and liver function, thyroid function tests, and vitamin B12 and D levels. We'll also check for autoimmune markers, as autoimmune conditions can sometimes cause neurological symptoms. As for the MRI, I’ll write the order now and send it to the radiology department. Scheduling can take a few days, sometimes a week, depending on their availability. I'll have my nurse, Sarah, call you tomorrow to help you schedule it. She’ll also give you some instructions on how to prepare for the MRI – you'll need to remove any metal objects and let them know if you have any claustrophobia. In the meantime, I'm going to give you a prescription for a multivitamin to address any potential deficiencies. It won't fix the underlying problem, but it's a good place to start. I’ll also recommend that you avoid any strenuous activity until we have more information. Do you have any questions about any of that?
PATIENT: No, that all sounds… reasonable, Doctor. Multivitamin, no strenuous activity… I can do that. And I appreciate Sarah calling me to schedule the MRI. I’ll try not to worry too much in the meantime, though that’s easier said than done, I suppose. One question… what kind of autoimmune conditions are we looking at? Are there any specific ones that are more likely, given my symptoms? I understand you can’t diagnose anything yet, but I’m just… trying to understand what we’re ruling out, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: That's a very good question, Gedalya, and it's perfectly understandable that you're trying to understand what we're looking at. Given your symptoms – the weakness, drooping eyelids, blurred vision, difficulty swallowing, and diminished sensation – we'll be looking at conditions like Multiple Sclerosis , Myasthenia Gravis, and Guillain-Barré syndrome. These conditions can all affect the nerves and muscles, causing similar symptoms. There are other possibilities as well, of course, but these are some of the more common ones that we'll want to rule out. It's important to remember that these are just possibilities, and we don't know for sure what's going on yet. The blood tests and MRI will help us narrow down the possibilities and get a clearer picture of what's causing your symptoms. I know it's a lot to take in, but we'll take things one step at a time. We'll get the tests done, review the results, and then discuss the next steps. Do you have any other questions about any of that?
PATIENT: No, I think that… explains things a bit better, actually. Multiple Sclerosis, Myasthenia Gravis… I’ve heard of those, I think. It’s… daunting, to be honest, but I appreciate you being so thorough and explaining everything so clearly. I think I’m okay for now. I’ll just… try to relax and wait for Sarah to call. Thank you, Doctor Maskal. I really appreciate your time and your help.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Gedalya. I'm glad I could help. It's definitely a lot to process, and it's okay to feel overwhelmed. Remember, we'll take things one step at a time, and we'll get to the bottom of this. Don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. Sarah will be in touch tomorrow to schedule the MRI. Take care, and I'll see you soon.
