DOCTOR: Good morning, Jahaad. I'm Dr. Panjoj. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. Um… well, it’s a bit difficult to explain precisely. I’ve noticed some swelling, and it’s been… concerning. Honestly, I don’t remember exactly when it started, or what might have caused it. It just… appeared.
DOCTOR: Okay. “Just appeared,” you say. That's alright, we'll figure it out together. Can you tell me where you’re noticing this swelling, specifically?
PATIENT: It’s… here, mostly. On my face. And perhaps a little… around my jawline? It’s hard to pinpoint. It doesn’t hurt, not usually, but it feels different. Like… puffiness, I suppose? I apologize for being so vague, Doctor. My memory isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all, Jahaad. It's perfectly common to have trouble recalling specifics. Puffiness is a good way to describe it. And it’s not hurting at all?
PATIENT: No, not really hurting. Occasionally, if I… press on it, there’s a slight discomfort, but it’s fleeting. It’s more of a… self-consciousness, if that makes sense? It just feels… unusual. And it seems to be… bigger some days than others. I haven’t noticed anything that makes it worse, or better, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, no pain, just puffiness and some variability in size. And you haven’t noticed any connection to specific activities, foods, or anything like that?
PATIENT: No, I haven’t. I’ve been trying to recall if I ate anything different, or did anything strenuous, but… nothing comes to mind. I do… travel quite a bit for work, perhaps that’s relevant? Different climates, different foods… but I can't say for certain. It feels quite random, truly. I’m sorry, I wish I could be more helpful.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Jahaad. The travel is good information, we’ll keep that in mind. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the swelling?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… let me think. No fever, no dizziness. My vision seems… normal, I believe. No headaches. I haven’t felt particularly fatigued, although I am often tired after a long flight, but that’s to be expected, isn't it? Oh… and sometimes my… my mouth feels a little dry. Is that relevant? I don’t know if that’s connected, or simply because I don’t drink enough water.
DOCTOR: Okay, no fever, dizziness, vision changes, or headaches. Mouth dryness… that could be relevant, or as you said, just dehydration. Let's talk about your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Past medical history… that’s a difficult question. I’ve been generally healthy, thankfully. I did have… a bout of tonsillitis when I was a child, but that was many years ago. And I broke my arm, also as a child. Nothing serious, nothing chronic, to my knowledge. I don't recall ever being diagnosed with anything significant. I do… see a therapist occasionally, for… general wellbeing, but it's nothing physically related.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no chronic medical conditions, just childhood tonsillitis and a broken arm. And you see a therapist—that's good. Any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: No, no surgeries. Never had any. I… I really haven't spent much time in hospitals, Doctor. Or doctors' offices, for that matter. Which is perhaps why I’m so flustered about this swelling. It just feels… unusual for me. I apologize for rambling.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all, Jahaad. It’s perfectly understandable to be concerned when something new arises, especially if you’re not used to dealing with medical issues. Let’s talk about your family history. Do any of your close family members have any significant medical conditions?
PATIENT: Family history… My mother, she has… high blood pressure, I believe. And my grandfather, on my father’s side, he had some sort of… heart condition, later in life. Nothing else springs to mind immediately. My family isn't very forthcoming with medical details, if I'm honest. It’s not a topic we often discuss. I wish I could be more precise, but that’s all I really know.
DOCTOR: Okay, so high blood pressure in your mother and a heart condition in your grandfather. That’s helpful. Now, a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: No, absolutely not. I’ve never smoked. And I rarely drink alcohol, perhaps a glass of wine with dinner occasionally, but that’s it. I try to maintain a healthy lifestyle, when I can. It’s difficult with all the travelling, but I do try.
DOCTOR: Good. And do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, I don't believe so. I haven't had any allergic reactions that I'm aware of. I'm generally fine with most medications, but I always mention to the pharmacist if I have any concerns. No known allergies, thankfully. Perhaps a slight sensitivity to certain perfumes, but nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter ones?
PATIENT: No, I’m not. I don’t take anything regularly. Occasionally, I’ll take a pain reliever for a headache, but that’s it. Nothing prescribed, nothing ongoing. I prefer to avoid medication whenever possible, if that makes sense. I find rest and hydration are usually sufficient.
DOCTOR: That makes sense. Okay, Jahaad, we've covered a lot of ground. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if you don’t mind. I’ll just take a look at your face, feel your lymph nodes, and listen to your heart and lungs. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. That sounds perfectly reasonable, Doctor. Please, proceed. I trust your judgment entirely. I apologize again for being so vague, but I hope this examination helps to shed some light on the situation. I’m ready whenever you are.
DOCTOR: Alright. Your heart and lungs sound clear. Your lymph nodes are… slightly enlarged, but not dramatically so. They’re tender to the touch, which can indicate inflammation. The swelling on your face is primarily around your cheeks and jawline, as you described. It’s soft and pliable, not hard or fixed. No redness or warmth to the touch. I'm also noting some mild dryness of your skin. Based on what you've told me and what I've found during the exam, it could be a number of things. It's not immediately alarming, but we need to investigate further to rule out anything serious.
PATIENT: I understand. "A number of things…" that sounds… concerning, but I appreciate your honesty. What kind of things are we considering, if you don’t mind me asking? And what sort of investigations are you proposing? I trust your professional opinion entirely, Doctor, I just want to be prepared.
DOCTOR: Okay. Given your travel history, the mild swelling and tenderness of the lymph nodes, and the dryness of your skin, we need to consider a few possibilities. It could be a mild viral infection, an allergic reaction, or – less likely, but we need to rule it out – something related to a more systemic condition. Rarely, travel can expose one to certain infections. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to order a complete blood count to check for signs of infection or inflammation. I'd also like to order a basic metabolic panel to assess your kidney function and electrolyte balance, since you mentioned some mouth dryness. And finally, a simple allergy test might be helpful, just to see if we can identify any triggers. Does that sound reasonable to you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly reasonable, Doctor. Blood count, metabolic panel, allergy test… I trust your judgment entirely. It’s good to be thorough, and I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly. Will these tests require a lot of blood? I'm not particularly… fond of needles, if I’m honest. And how long will it take to get the results? I have a flight next week, and I want to ensure I'm fit to travel.
DOCTOR: It won't be a large amount of blood, Jahaad. Just a few vials. And we can arrange for a comfortable and efficient draw. As for the results, the CBC and BMP typically come back within 24-48 hours. The allergy test may take a little longer, perhaps 3-5 business days. I'll write the orders for you now. The lab is just down the hall, and they’ll take it from there. Once we have the results, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and determine the next steps. In the meantime, if you experience any fever, difficulty breathing, or significant worsening of the swelling, please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic immediately. Is that clear?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s perfectly clear, Doctor. 24-48 hours for the blood work, 3-5 days for the allergy test. And to contact you immediately if anything worsens. I appreciate your thoroughness, and your patience with my… vagueness. I’ll head to the lab now. Thank you again for seeing me today. I feel much better knowing we have a plan in place.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Jahaad. I’m glad I could help. Don’t hesitate to contact us if you have any questions or concerns. I’ll see you at your follow-up appointment. Have a safe trip, and please take care.
PATIENT: .
