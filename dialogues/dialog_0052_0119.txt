DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Wartick. My name is Dr. Patricia Shely. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s…well, it’s a bit embarrassing, to be frank. It’s about…a problem. A rather delicate problem, if you don’t mind me saying. It’s…discharge. From…down there. It’s not pleasant and I haven't the faintest idea what's causing it. Really, I expect you to know these things.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Wartick. It’s perfectly alright to discuss these concerns with me – that's what I’m here for, and it's very common. There’s absolutely no need to be embarrassed. Many women experience this at some point in their lives. To help me understand what's going on, could you describe the discharge for me?
PATIENT: Well…it’s not like a normal…you know. It’s…thicker. And…off-color. Not clear, certainly. More…yellowish-green, I’d say. And there’s…an odor. Not a good odor, I assure you. It’s been going on for…oh, goodness, I don't know exactly. A week, perhaps? Maybe a little longer. I really didn’t pay it much attention at first, but it’s…worsening. Honestly, I’ve always been very…clean, and I don’t understand why this is happening. It’s quite upsetting, really.
DOCTOR: Thank you for being so open with me, Ms. Wartick. A yellowish-green discharge with an odor is certainly something we need to investigate. And you’re right to be concerned. You mentioned it’s been going on for about a week and is worsening. Has there been any itching, burning, or pain associated with it?
PATIENT: Well…now that you mention it, yes. A bit of itching, mostly. Not constant, but it flares up sometimes. And…a slight burning sensation when I…go to the bathroom. It’s not excruciating, mind you, but definitely noticeable. It’s just…uncomfortable. I haven’t been…with anyone, if that matters. I haven't been intimate with anyone in…well, a very long time. So it couldn’t be…that sort of thing. I hope.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful information, Ms. Wartick. The itching and burning are important details. And knowing you haven’t been sexually active recently is also relevant. To get a clearer picture, could you tell me a little bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Medical history… Let me think. I’ve always been fairly healthy, thankfully. I had the usual childhood illnesses, measles, mumps, rubella – all that. Nothing serious. I had my gallbladder removed about fifteen years ago, and I have…high blood pressure, but it’s managed with medication. And…arthritis, a bit. It’s mostly in my hands, makes it difficult to do certain things. Oh, and I’m on Medicare now, of course. I don’t really go to the doctor much unless absolutely necessary, if I’m being honest. I just…don't like feeling poked and prodded. Is that important?
DOCTOR: That’s all very helpful, Ms. Wartick. Knowing about the gallbladder removal, high blood pressure, and arthritis is good information. And yes, your preference regarding medical examinations is important – we will certainly take that into consideration. Do you know the name of the medication you take for your high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Let me see…I have it written down somewhere… Ah, here we are. It’s…Lisinopril. Yes, Lisinopril. Ten milligrams, once a day. And I take a…Naproxen for the arthritis, as needed. Usually two pills when it’s particularly bad. I hope that’s enough information. Really, Doctor, I’m not a complicated case. I just want this…problem…fixed. It's most undignified.
DOCTOR: You’re not a complicated case at all, Ms. Wartick. And I understand your desire for a quick resolution. Now, have you ever had any sexually transmitted infections, or had a previous diagnosis of vaginitis or any other gynecological issues?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no! Absolutely not! I’ve never had anything like that. I was…very careful, in my youth. And I’ve only ever had…one partner, a very long time ago. He was a…respectable man. And no, I’ve never been diagnosed with anything gynecological. Never had any…troubles…down there, until now. I’ve always been very particular about hygiene, as I said before. I really can’t imagine where this could have come from. It’s quite…distressing.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that information, Ms. Wartick. It's good to know. Now, I'd like to ask about your family history. Do any of your close relatives – mother, sisters, daughters – have a history of vaginal infections, pelvic inflammatory disease, or other gynecological issues?
PATIENT: Well…my mother, bless her soul, didn’t really talk about such things. It wasn’t…done…in those days. And I don’t have any sisters. I had a younger brother, but he…well, men don’t have these sorts of problems, do they? I don't recall any aunts having…issues either. Honestly, Doctor, my family was not a very…communicative bunch. We kept things to ourselves. It’s…a bit embarrassing, asking about such things. I’m not even sure what “pelvic inflammatory disease” is. Is it something I should be worried about?
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly alright, Ms. Wartick. It's very common for families not to discuss these things. And it’s understandable that you’re unsure about pelvic inflammatory disease. It's an infection of the reproductive organs, and we'll discuss it further if necessary. For now, don't worry about it. Now, to get a better understanding of what's going on, I'd like to perform a brief physical exam. This will involve an external examination and I'll need to take a sample of the discharge for testing. This will help us determine the cause of the infection and the best course of treatment. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh…a physical exam? Well…I suppose it’s necessary. But…must it be so…invasive? I really don’t like being poked and prodded, as I mentioned. And the thought of someone…taking a sample…it’s quite unpleasant. Is there absolutely no other way? Couldn’t you just…give me something for it? An antibiotic, perhaps? I’ve heard those work wonders. Really, Doctor, I’m not a fan of these sorts of procedures. I just want this to be over with as quickly as possible. And…please be gentle.
DOCTOR: I completely understand your apprehension, Ms. Wartick. I assure you, I will do everything possible to make you comfortable. And you are right to ask about alternatives, however, without a sample, it's difficult to determine the exact cause of the infection and ensure the correct treatment. The exam itself is quite brief. I'll start with an external examination and then use a speculum to gently visualize the vaginal area. The sample collection will be quick and may cause some mild discomfort, but it shouldn’t be painful. I will explain each step before I perform it and stop immediately if you experience any significant discomfort. We can also discuss a broad-spectrum antibiotic as a temporary measure while we await the lab results, but it's important to identify the specific cause of the infection to ensure the antibiotic is effective and to prevent antibiotic resistance. Would you like me to proceed with the exam and sample collection, keeping in mind we can stop at any time if you’re uncomfortable?
PATIENT: Oh…very well. If you insist it’s absolutely necessary. But please, Doctor, be as quick and gentle as possible. And explain everything before you do it, as you promised. I really don’t want any surprises. And…could I perhaps hold your hand? I’m feeling rather…nervous. Honestly, I haven’t been this anxious in years. It’s just…so undignified. Very well. Let’s get it over with. But please, be gentle. And…explain, explain, explain.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Wartick. I will explain every step, and we can proceed at your pace. You are in control. I’ll be as gentle as possible, I promise. First, I’m going to ask you to lie on the examination table with your knees bent and your feet relaxed. I'll use a clean sheet to cover you for privacy. Then, I'll perform an external examination to check for any visible signs of irritation or inflammation. This will involve simply looking at the area. After that, I'll gently insert a speculum – a small, curved instrument – into your vagina. This will allow me to visualize the cervix. It may feel a little bit of pressure, but it shouldn’t be painful. If you feel any discomfort, please let me know immediately. I can stop at any time. Once the speculum is in place, I’ll use a small swab to collect a sample of the discharge. This will only take a few seconds. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Alright…I suppose so. But please…be very careful. And explain everything before you touch anything. I really don’t like surprises, as I’ve said. And…could you perhaps talk to me while you do it? Distract me, perhaps? Tell me about…the weather, or…anything. Just don’t let me dwell on what you’re doing. It’s just…so unsettling. Very well. Proceed, but be gentle. And talk to me. Please.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Wartick. I will explain everything as I go and keep you informed every step of the way. And I'm happy to distract you – let’s talk about the weather. It’s been quite a summer, hasn’t it?
PATIENT: Yes…very hot. Too hot, if you ask me. I prefer a cool, cloudy day. All this sunshine…it’s just dreadful. And the humidity! It’s…suffocating. Honestly, I haven’t been outside much this summer. It’s just…too unpleasant. Oh dear…what are you doing now? I feel…something. It’s…cold.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Wartick, I’m just gently inserting the speculum now. It’s a little bit cool, yes, that’s normal. Just try to relax your muscles as much as possible – that will make it easier and more comfortable. We’re just opening things up a little bit so I can get a better look. It may feel some pressure, but shouldn't be painful. Remember to breathe deeply. I’m just getting into position now… okay, I can see everything I need to see. I’m going to gently collect a sample of the discharge now, it will only take a few seconds. Just a small swab… I notice some yellowish-green discharge present. The vaginal walls appear slightly inflamed, but no obvious lesions are noted. I'm now collecting the sample for testing. Almost done… There we go. That’s it. Okay, Ms. Wartick, all done. Just removing the speculum now. That wasn’t too bad, was it?
PATIENT: No…it wasn't pleasant. But I suppose it's over now. Thank goodness. I just want to…get dressed. And…forget this ever happened. What will you do with the sample? Will you tell me what’s wrong? Is it something serious? I just…want to know. I hate being kept in the dark. Honestly, Doctor, I’m a nervous wreck. Please tell me…will I need…injections? Or…surgery?
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Wartick. I understand your anxiety, and I’ll do my best to answer all your questions. I'll send the sample to the lab for analysis. They will check for common causes of vaginitis, such as bacterial vaginosis, yeast infections, and sexually transmitted infections. It usually takes about 2-3 business days to get the results back. Based on what I saw during the exam, the inflammation suggests an infection. However, we need the lab results to determine the exact cause. At this point, it's too early to say definitively if you'll need injections or surgery. Most cases of vaginitis are treated with antibiotics or antifungal medications, which are typically administered orally or topically. Injections and surgery are rarely necessary. Let's wait for the lab results before we jump to any conclusions. In the meantime, I'll write you a prescription for a broad-spectrum antibiotic to help relieve your symptoms while we wait. It may not cure the underlying infection, but it should provide some temporary relief. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: A broad-spectrum antibiotic…well, alright. Anything to get some relief. I just…don’t want to suffer any longer. And you’re sure…surgery isn’t likely? I really don’t like the thought of that. Honestly, Doctor, I haven’t been this anxious in years. It's just…undignified. Very well. Give me the prescription, and let’s just hope for the best. And please…call me if the results are anything serious. I don’t want to be left in the dark. Very well. And thank you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Wartick. I completely understand your anxiety, and I assure you, surgery is highly unlikely. I’ll call you immediately with the lab results, regardless of what they show. You won’t be left in the dark. Here’s the prescription for the antibiotic. You can fill it at your local pharmacy. Be sure to follow the instructions carefully and complete the full course of treatment, even if you start feeling better. I’ll also give you some instructions on how to manage your symptoms while you wait for the antibiotic to take effect. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No…I think that’s all. I just…want to go home now. And…forget this ever happened. Honestly, Doctor, you’ve been very kind. Thank you for your patience. I know I’ve been…difficult. Very well. Goodbye.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Wartick. It was my pleasure to assist you. And please, don't worry about being difficult – it's perfectly normal to be anxious in situations like these. If you have any questions or concerns in the future, please don't hesitate to call the office. I wish you a speedy recovery. Goodbye, Ms. Wartick. Take care.
