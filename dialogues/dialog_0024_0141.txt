DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Ferneding. I am Dr. Mutnick. Now, let’s not waste time, shall we?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Yes, please, let’s get right to it. It’s been… well, it’s been bothering me for a few weeks now, this itching. Everywhere, really. It’s quite annoying.
DOCTOR: “Everywhere,” you say?
PATIENT: Yes, everywhere. Not… not painful itching, just… constant. Like a really bad case of mosquitoes, but there aren’t any mosquitoes. Arms, legs, back, even my… well, everywhere. It’s hard to describe. It keeps me up at night, mostly. And it’s… well, it's just frustrating. I haven't changed anything, you know? Soap, laundry detergent, nothing.
DOCTOR: Hmm. And how long precisely has this “constant” itching been occurring?
PATIENT: Let me think… it started, oh, probably around the second week of July, maybe a little before. So, about a month now, give or take a few days. It wasn't bad at first, just a little annoying. But it’s gotten steadily worse, especially in the last week or so. I keep thinking it'll go away on its own, but… it hasn't. It's really starting to drive me crazy.
DOCTOR: And are you experiencing any other symptoms alongside this itching?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… hmm. Let me see. No fever, no rash, no swelling. I haven't noticed any changes in my skin besides the itching. No fatigue, no weight loss. Appetite’s normal, I think. I… I haven’t really noticed anything else, Doctor. Just the itching. It's mostly just the itching, really. It’s just… relentless. Sometimes I feel like I'm going to scratch my skin off.
DOCTOR: Have you been exposed to any new environments recently?
PATIENT: New environments… that’s a good question. Not really. I mostly stay around here, you know? I go to the market, sometimes visit old friends in the next town over, but that's about it. I did help my neighbor clear some brush out of his yard a couple of weeks ago, but it was just normal weeds and stuff. I wore long sleeves and pants, though. Nothing… exotic, Doctor. I haven’t been camping or hiking or anything like that. Just the usual, really.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let's proceed with a physical examination. Please, if you would, lie down on the examination table. We need to rule out the obvious, shall we?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. Just let me know if you need me to move a certain way. It's a little harder getting around these days, you know? But I'll do my best.
DOCTOR: Hmm. No visible rash, no excoriations… Skin appears otherwise normal. Now, let’s examine your back. Please, relax. No palpable masses or areas of sensitivity. Skin turgor is within normal limits. No edema. Circulation appears adequate in all extremities.
PATIENT: Okay. That’s good to hear, I suppose. Though, it’s still itching, you know? It doesn't look like anything is wrong, but it feels awful. Is there something else you can check? Maybe… a blood test? Or something to… calm the itching down, at least temporarily? It's just... so distracting. I can barely sleep, and I’m having trouble concentrating. It’s driving me up the wall.
DOCTOR: We can certainly order some blood work. A complete blood count and a comprehensive metabolic panel. That will help us rule out systemic causes. But frankly, based on the physical examination, I suspect this is a dermatological issue, possibly exacerbated by your… rural environment. But we’ll proceed systematically. I'll also order a liver function test. Just to be thorough. In the meantime, I can prescribe a mild topical corticosteroid. It won't eliminate the itching entirely, but it may provide some temporary relief. Do you have any known allergies to topical medications?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of, Doctor. I’ve used creams and lotions before, nothing like that bothered me. Topical corticosteroid sounds good, if it might help a little. Anything to get some sleep. The liver function test sounds sensible, too. I don’t drink much, but better safe than sorry, I always say. Rural environment… you think it’s something in the air or the water? I never thought of that. It's a bit of a strange place, I suppose. Lots of old farmland.
DOCTOR: Very well. Here is the prescription for the topical corticosteroid. Apply a thin layer to the affected areas twice daily after bathing. And here is the lab order. Please go to the lab down the street and have those tests done as soon as possible. The results should be available in a few days. Now, if the itching persists or worsens despite the corticosteroid, or if you develop any other symptoms, such as a rash, fever, or swollen lymph nodes, you must contact me immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, I understand perfectly, Doctor. Twice daily after bathing, and contact you if anything changes. I’ll get those tests done first thing tomorrow morning. Thank you very much. I really appreciate you taking the time to look at this. It’s been… well, it’s been quite a nuisance. Hopefully, this will get to the bottom of it.
DOCTOR: Very well. That will be all for today. Please, do not hesitate to call if you have any questions. Next patient. .
PATIENT: Okay, thank you again, Doctor. Have a good day.
