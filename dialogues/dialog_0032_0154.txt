DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Wease. I’m Dr. Pipkorn. I see here you’re 66 years of age. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Yes, sixty-six… or maybe sixty-seven? It all blurs together, you know. I… well, I keep getting sick. Down there. With my waterworks. It's been happening on and off for… a while now. Honestly, I don’t keep very good track of things. It’s a bother, really.
DOCTOR: Yes, well. "Down there" is rather vague, Ms. Wease. Could you be more specific?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Specific… It… it burns when I go to the bathroom. And I have to go so often. Even when I haven’t had much to drink. It’s… uncomfortable, to say the least. Is that specific enough? It’s just… not a pleasant topic, you understand.
DOCTOR: Burning with urination and frequency… alright. And when did this start, roughly?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Roughly… Let me see… it must be… several months, at least. Maybe longer. It started slowly, just a little discomfort. I thought it was just getting older, you know? Then it got worse, then better, then worse again. It's very unpredictable. I truly can’t pinpoint a date, I apologize.
DOCTOR: Unpredictable… Ms. Wease, while I appreciate your candor, establishing a timeline is important. Have you noticed any blood in your urine, or any pain in your lower back or sides?
PATIENT: Blood…? Oh, goodness, I don't think so. I haven’t looked that closely, if you understand. I try not to dwell on it. And back pain… well, my back always aches a little. I have arthritis, you see. It’s hard to say if it's different pain, or just the usual sort. Everything aches at my age!
DOCTOR: Arthritis… alright. Have you experienced any fever, chills, nausea, or vomiting alongside this discomfort?
PATIENT: Fever…no, I don't believe so. I haven't felt hot, not that I recall. And nausea? No, not really. I have a bit of a delicate stomach, sometimes, but that’s just my eating habits, I think. I do enjoy a good pastry. But no chills or vomiting, no. Is this going to be a long list, Doctor? I have an appointment later this afternoon.
DOCTOR: Ms. Wease, these questions are necessary to determine the cause of your symptoms. Do you have any difficulty emptying your bladder completely?
PATIENT: Oh… difficulty…? Well, sometimes it feels like it doesn’t quite come out all at once. I have to… try a little bit harder, perhaps. And sometimes, even after I go, I feel like there’s still a little bit left. It’s not terrible, but it’s… noticeable. I suppose that’s difficulty, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you had any changes in your vaginal discharge?
PATIENT: Oh my. Doctor, really! That is… a very personal question. I… well, I try not to pay much attention to such things. Everything is… different these days. Honestly, I’d rather not discuss it. Is it absolutely necessary?
DOCTOR: Ms. Wease, it is necessary. Changes in discharge can be indicative of infection, which can cause your symptoms. It’s a crucial part of my assessment. Is it increased?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Very well. Yes, I suppose it has been a bit more than usual. It’s… watery. And it doesn't smell nice, if you must know. But I figured that was just… age again. Everything seems to be changing, and not for the better, if I'm honest.
DOCTOR: Increased, watery discharge with an odor… alright. Now, have you been sexually active recently?
PATIENT: Doctor! Really! That is… incredibly forward. I am a divorced woman of sixty-something years! I have not been… active in decades! The very idea!
DOCTOR: Very well. I simply ask the necessary questions, Ms. Wease. Now, let’s proceed to a physical examination, if you would be so kind. I will need to examine your abdomen and perform a pelvic exam.
PATIENT: A… a pelvic exam? Oh, dear. That sounds… unpleasant. And rather intrusive, don’t you think? Is it absolutely necessary? Couldn’t we just… prescribe something? An antibiotic, perhaps? I have heard those work wonders.
DOCTOR: Ms. Wease, a diagnosis cannot be made without a proper examination. Prescribing medication without knowing the cause of your symptoms is irresponsible. We need to rule out several possibilities, including infection, bladder issues, and other potential causes. Please, if you would cooperate, it will only take a few moments. I assure you, I will be as quick and gentle as possible. Now, if you could please lie down on the examination table...
PATIENT: Oh, very well. But you must promise to be quick, Doctor. And gentle, as you say. This is most… distressing. I truly don’t understand why everything has to be so complicated.
DOCTOR: Please lie on your back with your knees bent and feet flat on the table. I’ll begin with an abdominal exam first. Now, I am going to gently press on your abdomen to check for any tenderness or masses. Please let me know if anything feels particularly uncomfortable. Any pain here?
PATIENT: Ooh, yes! There… right there. A little bit tender. Not excruciating, but… noticeable. It’s always been a little sensitive, but it feels… sharper today. Are you sure this is necessary? It’s making me quite anxious.
DOCTOR: Tenderness in the lower abdomen… alright. Now, I’m going to listen to your abdomen with my stethoscope. Normal bowel sounds… alright. Now, I’m going to need you to relax as much as possible. We will proceed with the pelvic examination now. This may be slightly uncomfortable, but I will be as gentle as possible. Please let me know if you experience any pain.
PATIENT: Oh, dear. This is… not pleasant at all. Oh… that’s… uncomfortable. Very uncomfortable. Please… please hurry. I truly don’t like this. Is something wrong? You’re very quiet.
DOCTOR: Alright. I am observing some inflammation and redness of the vaginal walls. There's some mild discomfort upon palpation of the cervix, but no obvious masses. I will need to send a urine sample for analysis to rule out a urinary tract infection, and I'm going to order a vaginal swab for testing to check for any infections. It appears you may have vaginitis, likely caused by an imbalance of bacteria or a mild infection. It’s not uncommon at your age, Ms. Wease. It’s easily treatable.
PATIENT: Vaginitis…? Easily treatable? Well, that’s… somewhat reassuring. But all this poking and prodding… I still find it rather distressing. What sort of treatment are we talking about, Doctor? And will it be… painful? I would truly like to be finished with this ordeal as quickly as possible.
DOCTOR: We’ll start with a course of topical cream, a metronidazole gel. It’s applied vaginally twice daily for a week. It typically resolves the issue. There may be some mild burning or irritation initially, but it should subside quickly. It’s not painful, Ms. Wease, merely… uncomfortable. I'm also recommending a probiotic supplement to restore the balance of good bacteria in your vagina. I’ll write you a prescription for both. Do you have any allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: Allergies…? Oh, goodness. I don’t keep very good track of such things. I believe I had a slight reaction to something once, many years ago… a rash, perhaps? But I can’t recall what it was. Nothing serious, I assure you. Mostly, I just try to avoid taking anything if I can. So, that’s all, then? I can go now?
DOCTOR: Alright. Given your inability to recall any specific allergies, we'll proceed with caution. I will document that you have no known drug allergies, but monitor for any adverse reactions. Here are your prescriptions for the metronidazole gel and the probiotic supplement. And this is a lab order for a urine analysis. Please take this to the lab downstairs. I'm also providing you with a discharge summary outlining our discussion and the treatment plan. Follow up with me in one week, or sooner if your symptoms worsen. Do you have any questions before you leave?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. Just…thank you, Doctor. I truly appreciate you getting this sorted out. I just wish it hadn’t been so… complicated. I believe that’s all. Good day to you.
DOCTOR: Very well. Try to maintain good hygiene, Ms. Wease. And don’t hesitate to contact the office if any concerns arise. .
