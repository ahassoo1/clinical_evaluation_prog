DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Hainley. I'm Dr. Trestrail. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. It's... well, it's my bruising. It’s been getting worse, even though I'm taking the blood thinner like I’m supposed to. It’s just… a lot more than usual, you know?
DOCTOR: Hmm. More bruising despite being compliant with your blood thinner. That is concerning. To get a better understanding, could you tell me a little more about when you first noticed this increase in bruising?
PATIENT: Okay, let me think… it started, oh, maybe a week ago? I bumped my arm on the corner of the table, which I do all the time, honestly, but this time it turned purple right away and just… spread. And then yesterday I noticed some on my leg, and I don’t even remember hitting it. It’s just… showing up.
DOCTOR: A week ago, with spontaneous bruising… alright. And how large would you say these bruises are, approximately?
PATIENT: Oh gosh, measuring bruises… I don’t know. Um… the one on my arm is maybe… the size of my palm? And the one on my leg is smaller, like… maybe a silver dollar? It's hard to say exactly, they’re kinda… blobby. Sorry, I'm not good at estimating sizes.
DOCTOR: Palm-sized and silver dollar sized… noted. And are these bruises painful?
PATIENT: Not really, no. A little sore to the touch, maybe, but not like… agonizing or anything. It's more worrying than painful, honestly. It just doesn’t feel right, you know? I'm always bumping into things, but it's never this bad.
DOCTOR: Alright. And besides the bruising, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm... let me think. No, not really. I've been a little tired lately, but honestly, who isn’t? I haven’t noticed any bleeding gums or anything like that. No nosebleeds. Just the bruising. I’m not sure if the tiredness counts, it could just be summer.
DOCTOR: No bleeding, just fatigue and increased bruising... Okay. Now, I see here you are currently on a blood thinner. Do you know why you were prescribed it?
PATIENT: Oh yes, I do. Dr. Lee put me on it about six months ago. It was because of… an irregular heartbeat. Atrial fibrillation, I think he called it. He said the blood thinner would help prevent… clots, or something? I’m terrible with medical stuff. But I've been taking it exactly how he told me to.
DOCTOR: Atrial fibrillation, preventing clots... Good. And do you recall the name of the blood thinner you're taking?
PATIENT: Ugh, now you're asking the hard questions! Let me see... I have the bottle at home, but… it's a little orange pill. And it has… letters on it. I think it starts with a 'W'? Warfarin, maybe? Is that right? I really should write this stuff down. Sorry, I'm just not good with remembering names.
DOCTOR: Warfarin, yes. That’s what the chart says. And are you taking any other medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Let me think... just the usual stuff. I take a multivitamin sometimes, but not every day. And I take ibuprofen occasionally for headaches, but not very often. Maybe once a month? Definitely nothing else. I try to stay away from too many pills, honestly.
DOCTOR: Okay. Now, I’m going to ask some questions about your medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you ever been diagnosed with any other medical conditions besides the atrial fibrillation?
PATIENT: No, not really. I had the flu really bad a couple of years ago, but that’s it. Nothing serious, never been hospitalized or anything like that. I try to stay healthy. I eat okay, I mean, I try to eat healthy. Nothing major, I promise.
DOCTOR: No significant medical history… alright. And has anyone in your family had problems with bleeding or bruising easily?
PATIENT: Hmm... that’s a good question. My grandmother, on my mom's side, she had… something with her blood, I think. She was always a little bit of a bleeder, easy to get cuts and scrapes that wouldn't stop. But that was a long time ago, and I don't really know the details. It was never talked about much. Does that count?
DOCTOR: Family history of bleeding… noted. And, finally, before we move on, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope, no allergies. I eat shellfish, take penicillin when I need it… nothing bothers me. Lucky me, I guess! Can we get this figured out now? I'm a little worried about this bruising, and I'd like to know what's going on.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Hainley. Now, I'm going to do a quick physical exam. I'll check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and then I'll take a closer look at these bruises. Please lie back on the examination table. We’ll start with your blood pressure.
PATIENT: Okay, sounds good. Just let me know if you need me to do anything. And please, don’t tell me it’s something serious. I'm already stressed enough.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Hainley. We'll take it one step at a time. First, let's just get your blood pressure. 140 over 90. A little elevated, but not drastically so. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Heart rate is a little irregular, consistent with the atrial fibrillation. Lungs are clear. Now, let's take a look at these bruises. Could you point them out to me?
PATIENT: Here, on my arm, is the one that started it all. And here, on my leg, is the one I noticed yesterday. See? They're just… showing up. And they're kinda… tender, but not really painful. It’s just weird. It doesn’t feel broken or anything, but… I don’t know.
DOCTOR: Hmm. It's a fairly large ecchymosis, as you mentioned. And this one is smaller, but also appears significant. No signs of acute injury, no swelling or warmth. Palpable ecchymoses on inner forearm and left shin, no acute signs of trauma. Now, based on your history and this exam, there are a few possibilities we need to investigate. One possibility is simply that your Warfarin dose needs adjusting. It can be tricky to get the right level. Another, less common, possibility is a bleeding disorder, though your history doesn’t strongly suggest that. To rule those out, I’d like to order some blood tests. A complete blood count, a coagulation panel – that will check how well your blood is clotting – and a basic metabolic panel to assess your overall health. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Blood tests… ugh. Okay, fine. But are they going to take a lot of blood? I get a little faint sometimes… And how long will it take to get the results? I really don’t want to wait forever. And… what if it is something serious? Just be honest with me, okay? I'd rather know.
DOCTOR: It will be a standard blood draw, Ms. Hainley, probably a couple of vials. We'll have a phlebotomist who is experienced with patients who get faint – they can take precautions. And we’ll get the results back within 24-48 hours. As for the possibility of something serious… it’s unlikely, but we need to rule out all possibilities. The blood tests will give us a clearer picture. If the tests come back abnormal, we may need to consult with a hematologist – a specialist in blood disorders. But let's not jump to conclusions. Most likely, it’s a Warfarin adjustment needed. I will also order a PT/INR to check your current anticoagulation level. In the meantime, try to avoid any activities that could cause injury. We'll go from there once we have the results. Does that sound like a reasonable plan?
PATIENT: Okay, fine. A reasonable plan, I guess. As long as it doesn't take forever. And you promise to tell me what's going on, even if it's bad? Just… please. No beating around the bush. And can I get a copy of the test orders? I like to keep track of things.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Hainley. I understand your concern, and I promise to be upfront and honest with you about the results. We’ll discuss them thoroughly as soon as they’re available. Here are the test orders. The phlebotomist will be in shortly to draw your blood. And if you feel faint at any point during the draw, please let them know immediately. They are trained to handle that. Is there anything else I can address for you at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Just… please hurry with the results. I'm a little anxious about this. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you listening.
