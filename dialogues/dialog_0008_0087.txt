DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Croonquist. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Cumper. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just… lab work, I think. The usual. Honestly, I don’t really keep track of these things anymore. Medicare sent something, I guess. Just want to get it over with, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see here you’ve had some regular check-ups with us before. Medicare likely sent you a notice for your annual wellness visit. That usually includes some blood work and a quick check-up. Is there anything new going on that prompted you to schedule this appointment specifically, or are you just here for the routine tests?
PATIENT: Routine, I suppose. Nothing new… feels like things are just… going. You know? I’m old, Doctor. Things go. Can we just… do the blood work? I have a thing later this afternoon. Don’t remember what, but it’s important.
DOCTOR: Right, of course. We can definitely get the blood work done. Just so I have a complete picture, even if it's just for documentation, could you tell me briefly about any medications you're currently taking, or any allergies you have?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Dust, maybe? Used to bother me. Medications… that’s a tough one. I think… something for my blood pressure? A little pill. White, I think. Honestly, the pharmacist handles most of that now. I just… take what they give me. It’s been years, Doctor. Years. Can we speed this up a bit? I’m really not good with remembering details.
DOCTOR: Okay, dust allergy noted. And a white pill for blood pressure… I’ll look that up in your records to confirm. Just to be sure, have you had any changes in your health recently, even small ones?
PATIENT: Changes… small ones? Everything feels small these days. I get tired easier, I guess. And my knees… well, they aren’t what they used to be. Everything aches a bit more. But that’s just… old age, right? I don’t want to bother you with details if it’s nothing important. Let’s just get the lab work done. Is that possible?
DOCTOR: Of course, we can get the lab work done. But I need to ask a few more questions, Mr. Croonquist, just to make sure we aren’t missing anything. Fatigue and joint pain can be part of aging, but they can also be signs of other things. It’s my job to rule those things out. Have you noticed any swelling in your ankles or feet?
PATIENT: Swelling… hmm. Now that you mention it, maybe a little? I wear these big boots, you see, so it’s hard to tell. But yeah, perhaps a bit. I thought it was just from standing too long. I used to work at the power plant, you know. Lots of standing. But it's been years since then. Really, Doctor, are these questions important? I'm starting to get a bit anxious. I just want to get this over with.
DOCTOR: They are important, Mr. Croonquist, but I'll try to be quick. Swelling in the ankles, especially with fatigue, could indicate a few things, like fluid retention. It's good you mentioned it. Now, have you experienced any chest pain, shortness of breath, or dizziness recently?
PATIENT: Chest pain… no, thankfully. Shortness of breath… sometimes when I climb the stairs, but I just figured I was out of shape. Dizziness… a little bit now and then, but I thought it was just getting up too fast. Honestly, Doctor, I feel like I’m wasting your time. I’m an old man, I'm going to ache and be tired. Can we please just do the blood work? I’m really not good at remembering these things, and it’s stressing me out. I have something I need to get to this afternoon.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Croonquist. I understand your frustration. We will get the blood work done. But before we do, I’m going to do a very quick physical exam – just listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and feel your ankles. It'll take less than five minutes. It’s important for me to have a baseline, especially with what you’ve told me. Then we’ll get the lab work ordered. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Fine, whatever. Just… get it over with quickly, please. My knees aren't what they used to be. And I really do have something I need to be at. Just… hurry.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you could just sit up here for me. I'll start with your blood pressure. Blood pressure is a little elevated, 148 over 88. Heart sounds are regular, but a little faint. Lungs are clear, but breathing is slightly labored. Now, let's take a look at your ankles… There’s some slight swelling, and it’s a little tender. Okay. That’s all for the physical exam. Let's get the lab work ordered. We'll need a blood sample to check your kidney function, electrolytes, and a complete blood count. And I’m going to order an EKG to check your heart rhythm.
PATIENT: EKG? Oh, good grief. Is that really necessary? Look, I just want the blood work. Is this going to take much longer? I have something I need to be at, and I'm starting to worry I'm going to miss it. I really don't understand why all this is needed. I just feel… tired, you know? A little achy. That's all. Can't you just do the blood work and be done with it?
DOCTOR: Mr. Croonquist, I understand your frustration. But the EKG isn't a long procedure – just a few stickers on your chest. It helps me rule out any potential heart issues that could be causing your fatigue and shortness of breath. It's a standard precaution given your symptoms. We need to be thorough. It will take about five minutes. Then, the lab work, and you'll be on your way. The nurse will come in shortly to get you set up for the EKG. Is there anything specific you're worried about missing this afternoon?
PATIENT: It's… a meeting. With my… with someone. I don't remember exactly who, to be honest. But it's important. They sent a reminder. A very firm reminder. And I'm terrible with dates and times these days. That's why I get so anxious about things like this. I just… I need to be there. Please, Doctor, can you just skip the EKG? I'll take whatever pills you need to give me. Just… let me go. I’m really not good with medical things, and I'm starting to feel overwhelmed.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Croonquist. I understand you're anxious and feeling overwhelmed. While I strongly recommend the EKG for a complete assessment, I respect your wishes. We can proceed with just the blood work for now. However, I want to be clear that we may need to revisit this if your symptoms worsen. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood. Once the results are back – usually within a few days – we can discuss them and decide on a plan. In the meantime, if you experience any chest pain, severe shortness of breath, or dizziness, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, I understand. Thank you, Doctor. Thank you very much. Just… the blood work is enough. That’s all I need. And I will… I will go to the emergency room if something happens. Thank you. Now, where do I go to get the blood taken? I just want to get this over with. Please.
DOCTOR: The nurse, Sarah, is just outside. She’ll come and get you in a moment. She'll take you to the lab, which is just down the hall to your left. She’s very good, and it won’t take long. Try to relax, Mr. Croonquist. We're getting there. And don't hesitate to tell Sarah if you're feeling anxious. I'll let her know you’re a little worried. Hopefully, the results will be straightforward.
PATIENT: .
