DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Brum. I’m Dr. Deschane. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. My head… the back of my head hurts. Been hurting for… maybe three days now? Not all the time, but it comes and goes. Like a… a dull ache, you know?
DOCTOR: Hmm. A dull ache at the back of your head for three days, intermittent. Okay. And can you describe when it comes and goes?
PATIENT: Well… it's hard to say exactly. It doesn't come with anything special. Not when I eat, not when I walk… just… happens. Sometimes when I'm sitting, sometimes when I’m… doing things. It’s not tied to anything I can tell. It just… is there, then it’s not. Like a little fire back there, but not a hot fire. More like… tired. My head is just tired back there.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, it's not consistently related to any specific activity, and you describe it as a tired ache, not a sharp pain. Have you had any other symptoms along with the headache?
PATIENT: Other… symptoms? Let me think. No… no fever. No… blurry vision. I haven’t thrown up. Maybe… a little trouble sleeping, but I always have trouble sleeping. Old man problems, you know? I don’t think that’s connected. No… nothing else I can think of. Oh! Sometimes my neck feels a little stiff. But it doesn’t always happen with the head pain.
DOCTOR: A little neck stiffness, intermittent. And you’ve had this for three days. Have you tried anything to alleviate the pain?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I took some… some pills. The white ones. My wife used to have them. For… for her aches. I don’t remember the name. They didn’t do much, to be honest. Maybe took the edge off for a little while, but it came back. I don’t like taking too many pills. Never did.
DOCTOR: I understand. And just to be thorough, have you experienced any recent trauma to your head or neck?
PATIENT: Trauma? No, Doctor. Nothing like that. I haven’t fallen, haven’t bumped my head… I work with the trains, you know? Rail yard. Careful work. I’m pretty good at not bumping my head. Been doing it a long time. No, no trauma. Just… this headache.
DOCTOR: And you mentioned working with the trains. Is your work physically demanding?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, it can be. Not always, but sometimes. Lots of walking, checking things… sometimes lifting. And it can be noisy, very noisy. Lots of metal clanging. I’m… getting older, so it’s harder now than it used to be. But I still do what I can. I used to operate the Dinkey, you know? Small train for moving cars around. Now I mostly… help out where they need me.
DOCTOR: Okay. So, physically demanding work, exposure to noise… Alright, Mr. Brum, I’m going to need to do a quick physical examination. Can you sit up for me?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, of course. Just let me know what you need me to do. I’m not afraid of a little poking and prodding. Just old bones, that’s all.
DOCTOR: Very good. First, I’m going to check your reflexes. Please relax your arms. And I'll take a look in your ears. Reflexes are normal. Now, let’s look at your ears. Ears appear clear. Now, I'm going to palpate your neck. There's some tenderness here. And finally, I'll assess your range of motion. Could you please turn your head slowly to the left, and then to the right?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. A little stiff on this side. It’s not bad, but it’s… tighter there. Like a knot sometimes.
DOCTOR: Alright. Limited range of motion on the right, with tenderness. Given your age, the intermittent nature of the headache, and the tenderness in your neck, I suspect this may be a musculoskeletal issue – likely a strain or tension headache related to your work. However, given your age and the possibility of other underlying causes, I do want to rule out anything more serious. I’m going to order a basic blood work panel to check for inflammation and rule out any infection. I also want to get an X-ray of your cervical spine, just to make sure there’s no underlying structural problem.
PATIENT: That… sounds alright, Doctor. Blood work, X-ray… you think that’s necessary? I just thought it was an old man ache. But if you think it’s best… I trust you. I just don’t want to be a bother.
DOCTOR: It’s my job to be thorough, Mr. Brum. And at your age, it’s always better to be cautious. The tests will help us determine the exact cause of your headache and ensure we’re providing you with the best possible care. The blood work is fairly straightforward. As for the X-ray, we can get that done here at the clinic. I'll have the nurse draw the blood now, and then schedule you for the X-ray. In the meantime, I recommend you take over-the-counter ibuprofen or naproxen for the pain, unless you have any medical conditions that prevent you from taking them. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, no allergies. Never had any trouble with pills before, except they don’t usually do much, like I said. Ibuprofen… that’s the white one, right? Okay, I can try that. I just… I don’t want to get hooked on anything. Old man habit, I guess. Just want to feel better, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand your concern. Ibuprofen is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory and is generally safe for short-term use. We're not looking at a long-term solution here, just some relief while we investigate the cause of your headache. The nurse will give you some written instructions about the dosage and potential side effects. If the pain doesn’t improve after a few days, or if it worsens, please contact the clinic immediately. We’ll get those tests done as quickly as possible and discuss the results with you. In the meantime, try to avoid strenuous activity and ensure you’re maintaining good posture. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor… I think you’ve explained everything pretty well. Just… the tests, then we see what happens. Thank you. I appreciate you taking the time. It’s nice to have someone listen, you know? Old men… we don’t always get listened to.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Brum. It's my job to listen, and I take that seriously. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood and schedule the X-ray. If anything changes before then, please don’t hesitate to call. Have a good day, and we’ll talk soon. .
PATIENT: .
