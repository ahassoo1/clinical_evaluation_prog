DOCTOR: Good morning, Raymonde. It’s good to meet you. I’m Dr. Iuzzolino. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s been a little rough lately. I’ve been feeling sick to my stomach a lot, and I just don’t have much appetite anymore. I get full really quickly, even if I barely eat anything. It’s… concerning, you know? I don't quite remember when it started exactly, just that it's been going on for a while now.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Feeling sick to your stomach and not having much appetite… and getting full quickly. It is concerning when things change like that. You mentioned it's been going on for a while… can you try to recall, roughly, how long?
PATIENT: Oh dear… that’s the tricky part. Time just… slips away these days, you know? I’d say… maybe a couple of months? Possibly three? It’s hard to say for sure. My daughter, bless her heart, she noticed it first, actually. She said I hadn’t been eating much at dinner, and she worried about me. I mostly just shrugged it off at first, thought it was just… old age catching up with me, maybe.
DOCTOR: It's very good of your daughter to be observant, and it's smart to get things checked out. It can be hard to pinpoint when something started. A couple of months, alright. And has anything specific seemed to make it worse, or better?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. I don’t think so, not really. It doesn't seem to matter what I eat, to be honest. Soup, salad, even just a little piece of toast… it all feels the same. And nothing makes it better, either. I’ve tried peppermint tea, like my grandmother used to do, but that didn’t help much. It just… is. A constant little upset.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it’s not related to anything specific you’re eating, and the peppermint tea didn’t provide relief. And you say it’s a “constant little upset”. Can you describe that upset a little more?
PATIENT: Well… it’s not really painful, exactly. More like… a queasy feeling. Like I’m on a boat, but a very gentle boat. And sometimes, after I eat even a little bit, I just feel… stuffed. Like I couldn’t possibly take another bite, even if I wanted to. It doesn’t happen every time, but often enough that it’s worrying me. It just… takes the joy out of things, you know? I used to love a good meal.
DOCTOR: I understand. A queasy feeling, like being on a gentle boat, and feeling full quickly even after eating very little. It sounds frustrating, and certainly takes away from enjoying things. Now, aside from the stomach upset and loss of appetite, have you noticed any other changes lately?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness… let me think. My energy levels haven’t been the best, I suppose. I get tired easily, even after a good night’s sleep. But honestly, at my age, who doesn’t get tired easily? It's hard to say if that's new, or just… getting older. And… oh! My daughter mentioned I seemed a little paler than usual. But I don't pay much attention to things like that.
DOCTOR: Okay, some fatigue and your daughter noticing you seem a bit paler. It’s good she’s observant. Now, have you had any changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Oh dear… that’s… a personal question, isn’t it? Well… I haven’t been as regular as I used to be, I suppose. More…constipated, if you want to know the truth. It’s just another little annoyance, really. I’ve been trying to drink more water, but it doesn’t always help. I haven’t thought much of it, to be honest, just figured it was part of getting old, too.
DOCTOR: It is a personal question, and you’re right to ask why I’m asking. Changes in bowel habits can be related to a number of things, and it’s important for me to understand the whole picture. Now, have you noticed any unintentional weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Oh… that’s… probably. My clothes are a little looser than they used to be, now that you mention it. I hadn’t really thought about it, just figured I was shrinking! But I haven’t been trying to lose weight, that’s for sure. I haven’t been weighing myself regularly, either, so I couldn't tell you how much.
DOCTOR: Okay, so clothes are a little looser, unintentional weight loss… and we've talked about the stomach upset, loss of appetite, feeling full quickly, fatigue, paler complexion and constipation. Now, let’s go over some other things quickly. Do you have any known allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, no, not that I know of. I’ve always been pretty lucky in that regard. Never had a bad reaction to anything, thankfully. I take a little vitamin D in the winter, but that’s it. And I haven't had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything serious, not in a very long time.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies, and no significant surgical history. Let me just pull up your records here… Okay, it confirms no documented allergies or surgeries. Now, what about your family history?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness… that's a long story. My mother, bless her soul, she had… something with her stomach, I think. Cancer, maybe? It was a long time ago, and I don't remember the details very well. And my father, he had heart trouble. But on my Cherokee side… well, we didn’t really talk much about those things when I was growing up. It wasn’t considered polite, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Okay, a mother with a possible history of stomach cancer, and a father with heart trouble. It’s alright that you don't remember the details – it's still helpful to know. Now, let me ask about your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any other substances?
PATIENT: Oh, no, never. Not a drop of alcohol, and certainly no smoking or anything like that. I was raised to believe those things were bad for you, and I’ve always followed that advice. I used to enjoy a good cup of coffee, but even that doesn't sit well with my stomach these days. Mostly, I just enjoy spending time with my daughter and tending to my animals.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful. Now, before we move on, I'd like to perform a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. It will help me get a better understanding of what might be going on. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s perfectly fine. I trust your judgment, Doctor. I suppose the more you know, the better. Go right ahead. I’m a bit worried, you know, but I’m trying to stay positive.
DOCTOR: Alright. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Then I’ll feel your abdomen. Please let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Now, I’m going to gently press on your abdomen. Hmm… a little tenderness in the upper abdomen, but nothing too alarming. There’s some mild distension, and a little bit of guarding here on the left side. Bowel sounds are present, but a bit sluggish. Okay. I’m going to check your reflexes and look in your ears and throat as well. Just a routine check.
PATIENT: Alright. That didn't seem too bad. My stomach is a little tender, you're right. I suppose I haven't been taking very good care of myself lately. Always putting others first. The rest… well, I leave it up to you, Doctor. You know what you're doing. Just tell me if you find anything concerning.
DOCTOR: Your reflexes are normal, and your ears and throat look fine. Everything appears normal on initial examination, but given your symptoms and the tenderness in your abdomen, I do want to order some blood work and a stool sample. It will help us rule out a number of possibilities. We'll check your complete blood count, electrolytes, liver and kidney function, and some inflammatory markers. The stool sample will check for any signs of infection or bleeding. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just want to know what's going on and get this sorted out. Blood work and a stool sample… alright. Will I need to come back for another appointment? Or will you give me instructions on how to collect the sample?
DOCTOR: Yes, you will need to come back for a follow-up appointment to discuss the results. I’ll give you instructions for collecting the stool sample, and a requisition form for the blood work. The lab is just down the hall, and you don't need an appointment. Here you go. Collect the stool sample as soon as possible, and bring the requisition form with you when you get your blood work done. Once you have the results, please call the office to schedule your follow-up appointment. In the meantime, if you experience any worsening symptoms – such as severe abdominal pain, fever, vomiting, or bloody stools – please go to the emergency room immediately. Is that clear?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s very clear. Stool sample as soon as possible, blood work, and call to schedule a follow-up appointment. And go to the emergency room if things get worse. I’ve got it. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve put my mind at ease a little bit, just knowing what we’re going to do.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Raymonde. I’m glad I could help ease your mind. It’s important to remember that we’re just gathering information at this point, and there are many possible explanations for your symptoms. We'll take it one step at a time. Is there anything else I can address for you today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s all. You’ve been very thorough, Doctor. I appreciate your kindness and patience. It’s… it’s nice to have someone listen.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Raymonde. That’s what I’m here for. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. I'll see you at your follow-up appointment. Have a good day, and take care of yourself. .
