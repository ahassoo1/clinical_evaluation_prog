DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Drahota. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Petrimoulx. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Honestly, I haven’t much time for this. It’s… my skin. It’s darkening. And I tire easily. It’s quite bothersome, really. I’ve been working, of course. Always working. But it seems worse lately. Do we need to go into extensive detail?
DOCTOR: I appreciate you being direct, Mr. Drahota. And no, we don't need to go into extensive detail unless it’s helpful. Let's start with the darkening skin. Could you tell me where on your body you’ve noticed this change?
PATIENT: Everywhere, Doctor. Everywhere, really. Arms, face… the usual places one gets sun, I suppose. Though I try to be careful. It’s not as if I want to look… weathered. It’s just… happening. Is that all? Can we just… determine what ointment to use and be done with it? My wife is waiting.
DOCTOR: I understand you’d like to be quick about this, Mr. Drahota. However, darkening skin can have several causes, and it’s important to understand what’s going on before recommending any treatment. Simply applying an ointment without knowing the cause might not be the best approach. To help me understand, could you tell me about when you first noticed this darkening?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, I haven't the foggiest. Some time ago. Months, perhaps? Years? It all blurs together, you understand. I’ve been a reinforcing iron worker for… well, a very long time. Sun exposure, dust, grime… it’s part of the job. I simply assumed it was that. Is this really necessary? Do you need a precise timeline for a bit of a tan?
DOCTOR: I appreciate your patience, Mr. Drahota. You're right, a precise timeline isn't always essential. But knowing roughly when it started helps me consider possible causes. And while sun exposure is a very likely factor, we do need to rule out other possibilities, just to be thorough. You also mentioned tiring easily. Is this new fatigue constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It’s… constant, mostly. Though some days are worse than others, naturally. I just don’t have the stamina I used to. I chalk it up to age, Doctor. Eighty-five years takes its toll. I’ve always been a hard worker, though. Never one to sit idle. Is there a pill for this? Something to give me a bit of energy? My wife worries, you see. She wants me to slow down. Preposterous.
DOCTOR: It's understandable to feel fatigue at 85, especially with a physically demanding job like yours. And it's very thoughtful of you to consider your wife’s concerns. We certainly can explore options to help with your energy levels. Before we do that, though, I'd like to ask a few more questions, just to get a clearer picture of what might be going on. Have you noticed any other symptoms alongside the darkening skin and fatigue?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Doctor, honestly, I’m a man who works. I get aches and pains. I get tired. That is the extent of it. Do you need a list of every minor discomfort I’ve experienced in the last eighty-five years? I assure you, it would be quite lengthy. And mostly irrelevant. I'm not one for complaining. Is this… is this going to take much longer? My wife… she made me a special lunch.
DOCTOR: I appreciate your stoicism, Mr. Drahota. You’re right, a complete list isn’t necessary. Just a few quick questions to rule out anything serious. Have you noticed any unintentional weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Weight loss? No, quite the opposite, I’d imagine. My wife keeps insisting I eat. She’s a wonderful cook, bless her heart. But no, I haven’t… diminished in size. If anything, I’ve probably gained a few pounds. Though I don’t weigh myself. It’s… vulgar. And none of your business, Doctor. Can we just get to the point? An ointment, a pill, and I’ll be on my way. My lunch is getting cold.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Drahota. I apologize if I’m taking too much time. Just a few more quick questions, then we can proceed. Have you experienced any changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Doctor. Really? Is this… is this standard practice? Asking a man about… such things? I find that exceptionally inappropriate. And frankly, quite intrusive. I came to you for a simple issue – darkening skin and fatigue – not a personal interrogation. I’m not discussing my… bowel habits with a stranger. Absolutely not. I think I’ve had enough of this. I’d like to see my wife now. And I'd like a referral to someone else. Someone who isn't quite so… inquisitive. .
DOCTOR: I sincerely apologize if my questions have upset you, Mr. Drahota. I was only trying to gather enough information to provide the best possible care. I understand your discomfort and absolutely respect your decision. I’ll have my nurse escort you to your wife. And I will, of course, provide a referral to another physician as you requested. Is there anything I can do to make you more comfortable while you wait?
