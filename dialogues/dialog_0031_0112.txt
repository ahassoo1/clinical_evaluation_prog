DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. MacVittie. My name is Dr. Rakosky. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Um… well, it’s a bit embarrassing to talk about, honestly. I’ve just been… going to the bathroom a lot lately. More than usual, and it’s… disruptive, to say the least. I’m not sure when it started exactly, it feels like it’s been gradually getting worse.
DOCTOR: I understand. There’s no need to feel embarrassed, Ms. MacVittie. These things happen, and it's important to get them checked out. “Going to the bathroom a lot” can mean a lot of different things, so let’s try to narrow it down. Could you describe what you mean by “a lot”?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Well… let me think. Usually, I’d say… maybe four or five times a day? But recently it’s been… eight, sometimes even more. And it’s not just during the day, either. I’ve been waking up a couple of times at night to go, which is… new. I really don’t remember ever having to do that before. It’s difficult to explain, because it doesn't feel like a full bladder, just… the urge is always there, even if there isn't much to go.
DOCTOR: Okay, eight or more times a day, waking up at night… and the sensation of urgency even with a small amount of urine. That gives us a better starting point. Now, are you experiencing any pain or burning when you urinate?
PATIENT: No, thankfully not. No pain or burning at all. It’s just… frequent. And a little inconvenient, to put it mildly. I don’t feel any discomfort while I’m going, just the constant need to go. Sometimes, it feels like I’ve just gone and then need to go again almost immediately, even if it’s just a tiny bit. It’s very strange. Do you… need me to be more specific? I worry I’m not explaining it very well.
DOCTOR: No, you’re explaining it perfectly well, Ms. MacVittie. Frequent urination, urgency, and the sensation of incomplete emptying – those are all helpful details. To get a more complete picture, could you tell me about any other symptoms you've been experiencing?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I’ve been feeling… a little more tired lately, but I always chalk that up to work. I’m a concierge, and the hours can be quite long. I haven’t really noticed anything else, to be honest. No fever, no pain in my back or sides, no unusual discharge… I’m trying to remember if I've been drinking more water than usual, but I can’t really say for sure. I suppose I do have a bit of a sweet tooth, so I've been having more sugary drinks, but nothing excessive. Is that… relevant? I really don’t recall anything else being different.
DOCTOR: Okay, fatigue, working long hours, a slight increase in sugary drink consumption, but no fever, back pain, or other concerning symptoms. The sugary drinks could be a factor, but let's explore other possibilities as well. Now, I'm going to ask you a few questions about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, such as diabetes, urinary tract infections, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s a good question. Let me see… I had a rather nasty bout of strep throat as a child, but that was… decades ago. And I broke my arm when I was ten. Other than that… I honestly don’t think so. I’ve always been fairly healthy, if a little prone to headaches. I’ve never been diagnosed with anything serious, and I don’t take any regular medications. My divorce was… a while back, and that was quite stressful, but I don't think that's related to this, is it? I apologize, my memory isn’t what it used to be. I really hope I’m not forgetting anything important.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all, Ms. MacVittie. You're doing very well. Strep throat as a child and a broken arm are not relevant to your current symptoms. The divorce was a stressful life event, and stress can sometimes contribute to urinary symptoms, but we'll need to rule out other causes first. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, I haven’t. Never any surgeries at all. I… I really try to avoid hospitals if I can. It's not that I'm afraid, exactly, just… I prefer to stay healthy and avoid needing them. It’s probably silly, but I always feel a bit anxious in those places. I've been lucky so far, haven't needed anything more than a check-up for years.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly understandable, Ms. MacVittie. It’s good you’ve been able to avoid needing surgeries. Now, let’s talk about your family history. Do any of your close family members – parents, siblings, grandparents – have any medical conditions, such as diabetes, kidney problems, or urinary issues?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a tricky one. My mother… she had high blood pressure, I believe. And my grandmother, on my father’s side, she… she had some sort of illness when she was older, something to do with her kidneys, I think. But I wasn’t very close to her, and my father never really talked about it. He always avoided discussing health issues. My brother is perfectly healthy, as far as I know. He lives in Portugal, and we don’t speak very often. I really wish I could be more helpful, but I’m afraid my family history is a bit of a blank. It's frustrating, isn't it?
DOCTOR: It is frustrating when information is limited, but you've given me what you know, and that's helpful. High blood pressure in your mother and a possible kidney issue in your grandmother are worth noting. Now, just a few more questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: Oh, no, never. I’ve never touched a cigarette in my life. My mother was a smoker, and I saw firsthand what it did to her, so I always steered clear. I find the smell quite unpleasant, actually. I do enjoy a glass of wine with dinner occasionally, but I wouldn’t say I drink heavily. Perhaps one or two glasses a week? Mostly I drink water, as I mentioned.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear. Occasional wine consumption is unlikely to be a significant factor. Finally, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I’m aware of. I’ve never had a reaction to any medication, and I don’t have any food allergies. I can eat pretty much anything. I sometimes get a mild rash if I’m bitten by mosquitoes, but that’s about it. I really don’t think I’m allergic to anything, thankfully. Is that… everything? I hope I haven’t forgotten anything important. I feel a bit flustered, to be honest, answering all these questions.
DOCTOR: No, you haven't forgotten anything, Ms. MacVittie. That’s a very thorough history. Thank you for your patience. Now, I’d like to perform a brief physical examination. This will involve listening to your abdomen, checking your reflexes, and a simple urine test. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly alright, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. I’m a little nervous about the urine test, but I suppose it’s necessary. Please, go ahead. I just hope it doesn't take too long.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. MacVittie. It won’t take long at all. First, I’m going to listen to your abdomen with the stethoscope. This will help me check for any abnormalities. Please lie back on the examination table. I'll need you to relax your abdomen as much as possible. Your bowel sounds are normal. No unusual noises detected. Now, I will gently palpate your abdomen to check for any tenderness or masses. No tenderness noted on palpation. Your abdomen is soft and non-distended. Now, I’ll check your reflexes. Your reflexes are within normal limits. Finally, we’ll need a urine sample. I’ll provide you with a sterile cup, and I’d like you to collect a mid-stream sample. Please wash your hands thoroughly before collecting the sample, and try to collect approximately two ounces of urine. There is a restroom just down the hall.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. That all sounds… manageable. I’ll go and collect the sample now. I’ll be right back. I hope I remember how to do a mid-stream sample correctly. It’s been a while since I’ve had to do one of these.
DOCTOR: 
PATIENT: Here you are, Doctor. I tried to follow the instructions as best as I could. I hope it’s enough. It was a little awkward, to be honest, remembering how to do it properly after so long.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. MacVittie. This looks perfect. I'll send this off to the lab for a urinalysis to check for infection, glucose, and other abnormalities. While we wait for the results, which should be back within a few days, I’d like to discuss some possible causes for your symptoms. Based on your history, it could be a number of things, including an overactive bladder, which is a common condition that causes a frequent and urgent need to urinate. It can sometimes be triggered by stress, diet, or simply changes in bladder function. Do you have any thoughts on what might be causing your symptoms?
PATIENT: That… that makes sense, actually. Stress has been quite high lately at work, with the long hours and demanding guests. And as I mentioned, I have been indulging in a few more sugary treats than usual. Perhaps it's a combination of those things? It’s just… frustrating, to be honest. I don't remember ever having issues like this before. I really hope it’s nothing serious. What happens if it is an overactive bladder? Is there anything that can be done about it?
DOCTOR: It's understandable to be frustrated, Ms. MacVittie. And it's good you're thinking about potential contributing factors. Stress and diet can definitely play a role. If it is an overactive bladder, there are several things we can do. Lifestyle modifications are often the first step. This includes reducing caffeine and sugar intake, drinking plenty of water, and practicing bladder training exercises, which can help you regain control over your bladder function. We can also discuss medications if lifestyle changes aren't enough. There are medications that can help relax the bladder muscle and reduce the urge to urinate. However, we need to rule out other possibilities first, which is why the urinalysis is important. It will help us determine if there’s an infection or other underlying cause for your symptoms. For now, I’d like you to keep a bladder diary for the next few days. This involves recording when you urinate, how much you drink, and any symptoms you experience. This will give me a better understanding of your bladder function. I can provide you with a form to fill out. Does that sound manageable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly manageable, Doctor. A bladder diary… I can certainly do that. It’s probably a good idea to keep track of things anyway, just to see if I can identify any patterns. I’ll try to be as detailed as possible. You’re very thorough, Doctor, and I appreciate it. It’s reassuring to know you’re considering all the possibilities. I just hope it doesn't take too long to figure out what's going on. I really dislike this constant need to go! Do you have the form here with you?
DOCTOR: Yes, I do. Here you are. It’s fairly straightforward. Just record the time you urinate, the amount of fluid you drank beforehand, and any associated symptoms, like urgency or discomfort. It's helpful to include the type of fluid you consumed as well. We'll review the diary at your follow-up appointment. As soon as the lab results are back, I’ll give you a call to schedule that. In the meantime, if you experience any fever, back pain, or blood in your urine, please contact the office immediately. Those could be signs of an infection that require prompt attention. Do you have any questions about the form or anything else we’ve discussed?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so, Doctor. The form seems pretty clear. I’ll start keeping track of things right away. And I’ll be sure to contact the office if I experience any of those symptoms. Thank you again for your thoroughness and patience. I feel much better knowing there are things we can do to address this. It’s just… a bit unsettling, dealing with something like this. I believe that’s all for now, isn't it? I’ll go home and start the diary.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s all for now, Ms. MacVittie. Please don’t hesitate to contact the office if you have any questions or concerns. We’re here to help. It was a pleasure meeting you, and I look forward to discussing the results with you soon. Have a good day.
PATIENT: It was a pleasure meeting you as well, Doctor. Thank you for your kindness and support. Have a good day to you too.
