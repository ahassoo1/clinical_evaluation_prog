DOCTOR: Well, good morning, Jinnie. I’m Dr. Fourney. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, it’s…well, it’s quite embarrassing to even discuss. But I suppose that’s what you’re paid for. It’s… a problem. A personal problem, you understand. And it’s been going on for a bit now.
DOCTOR: Personal problems are perfectly acceptable here, Jinnie. We deal with them all the time. No need to be embarrassed. Just…try to be specific. “A bit now” doesn’t really give me much to work with. Has this been weeks?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Weeks, yes. Perhaps…six weeks? It’s difficult to say precisely. One loses track of these things, you know. And it's… discharge. There’s discharge. From… down there. It’s most unpleasant. And I haven’t… well, I haven’t been with anyone, so it's not that kind of discharge, if you understand my meaning.
DOCTOR: Alright, six weeks of discharge. And you’re certain this isn’t related to sexual activity?
PATIENT: Doctor, really. At my age? Goodness no. I haven’t… indulged in that sort of activity for decades. It’s simply… a nuisance. A very upsetting nuisance, and frankly, I find it rather demeaning to even have to discuss it. It’s probably just… something women get, isn't it? Like hot flashes, only… wetter.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, “something women get” can be a lot of things, Jinnie. And it’s important to determine which thing. Has the discharge changed in color, consistency, or odor?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. You want me to describe it? Really? Very well. It's… whitish, mostly. Sometimes a bit yellow. And… it smells. Not horribly so, but… not pleasant. It's not like roses, that’s for certain. And it's… thicker than water, but not like… glue. Does that make sense? It’s…difficult to put into words. It’s just…icky.
DOCTOR: Whitish to yellowish, thicker than water, with an odor. Alright. Have you experienced any itching, burning, or pain with urination?
PATIENT: Now that you mention it… perhaps a little stinging. Not pain, exactly. More like…a discomfort. Especially when I… when I relieve myself. And sometimes, yes, a little bit of itching. It’s not constant, though. It comes and goes. Honestly, Doctor, I’m starting to feel rather foolish describing all of this. It’s just…so personal.
DOCTOR: It’s important information, Jinnie, and you’re not being foolish. It helps me understand what’s going on. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no. Just the… discharge and the little sting. I’m perfectly healthy otherwise, you know. I eat right, I get my rest… It’s probably just…a temporary thing. Perhaps something I ate? Or the weather? Honestly, Doctor, I'm not prone to worrying. But this is rather bothersome. And it’s simply embarrassing. I haven't even told my sister.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s not jump to conclusions. It's unlikely to be something you ate, and the weather rarely causes discharge. I'm going to need to do a quick pelvic exam. It will give me a better idea of what’s going on. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: A… an exam? Oh, goodness no. Absolutely not! I did not come here for an exam! I simply wanted your opinion, a little reassurance perhaps! I am a respectable woman, Doctor! I haven't had one of those in… decades! No, absolutely not. I think I’ve said enough. Perhaps I should just… consult another doctor. One who doesn't resort to…invasive procedures.
DOCTOR: Well, Jinnie, I appreciate your… concerns. However, providing a diagnosis without a proper examination is, frankly, irresponsible. It’s the standard of care. I cannot simply offer "reassurance" without knowing what's causing the problem. It could be something minor, or it could be something more serious. If you decline the exam, I'm afraid I cannot provide any further assistance. It’s not about being invasive; it's about providing you with appropriate medical care. I’m happy to refer you to another physician, of course, but they will likely request the same examination. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Honestly! I came to a doctor, not to be lectured! I've made my position perfectly clear. You seem determined to…embarrass me. I will find another physician. One who understands discretion. Good day, Doctor!
