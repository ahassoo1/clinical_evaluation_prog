DOCTOR: Good morning, Sherion. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Dashevsky. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Hmm... well, my chest. It hurts sometimes. Not all the time, you understand? It’s a… a squeezing feeling, mostly. It started, oh, maybe a week ago? A little more, a little less. I don’t keep good track of the days, you know. But a week sounds right.
DOCTOR: Okay, a squeezing feeling in your chest for about a week. That’s good information to start with. Can you tell me a little more about when you notice this squeezing?
PATIENT: When do I notice? Ah, good question. Usually when I walk. Not just any walking! When I walk up hills. Or… if I carry something heavy, like groceries. My husband, he helps now, mostly. But sometimes I try to be strong! And then… squeeze. Not bad bad, Doctor. Just… uncomfortable. It goes away when I stop and rest. Maybe five minutes, ten minutes. Something like that.
DOCTOR: Alright, so it seems to be related to exertion – walking uphill or lifting heavy objects. And it resolves with rest within about five to ten minutes. That’s helpful. Does the pain radiate anywhere – like to your arm, jaw, or back?
PATIENT: Radiate? You mean… does it go somewhere else? Hmm… sometimes, a little bit to my left arm. Not always! And not all the way down, just… in the shoulder, maybe. And… oh! Sometimes, a little bit in my jaw. But I think that's just because I clench it when it hurts, you know? I don’t know if that counts. It’s a strange feeling, this pain. It’s not like anything I’ve had before.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it can radiate to your left shoulder and sometimes you feel it in your jaw. The jaw thing could be related to clenching, as you said. It's good you're noticing those details. Now, let's talk a bit more broadly. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the chest pain?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… hmm. Let me think. Not really… I get a little short of breath when I walk up the hill, before the pain starts, sometimes. But I’m not a young woman anymore, you know? I get tired. And… oh! I feel a little sweaty when I’m doing the hill. Just a little! Nothing bad. Is that what you mean? Other than that, not much. I eat okay, sleep okay, everything is normal, mostly. Except the chest, of course.
DOCTOR: Okay, so shortness of breath before the pain with exertion, and a little bit of sweating. That's good to know. Let's move on to your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions – like high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Oh, medical history… My doctor back in Colombia, he checked me every year. I think everything was okay. I had… a little bit of high blood pressure, maybe ten years ago? But they gave me a little pill, and it went down. I stopped taking the pill when I moved here. Everything felt fine after that! And… no diabetes. No heart problems that I know of. I haven’t been in the hospital, not ever. Just the regular check-ups, you know? Nothing serious. I have Medicare now, that's good. I see a doctor sometimes for my arthritis, in my hands. But that's all. Is that what you need to know?
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful, Sherion. A history of slightly elevated blood pressure that resolved when you stopped medication, and arthritis in your hands. Do you know what medication you were taking for your blood pressure, if you recall?
PATIENT: Hmm… that was back a long time. The doctor in Colombia, he wrote me a prescription… a little white pill, I think. I don’t remember the name. It started with an “A”, maybe? Or a “B”? I really don’t know, Doctor. I just gave it to the pharmacist and they gave me the pills. I didn’t ask much, I just took them like he said. I stopped taking them after a year because he said my blood pressure was okay, and I haven’t really thought about it since. Is it important?
DOCTOR: It's okay, Sherion, don’t worry about it if you don't recall the name. It's just helpful information if we have it. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No surgeries. And no hospital, never. I had… when I was a little girl, I broke my arm falling from a tree. But that was a long time ago! They put a cast on it, and it healed. Nothing serious. Mostly, I've been healthy, you know? I eat my vegetables, I try to walk every day. And I go to church. That's all. No hospital, no surgeries. Just a broken arm a long, long time ago.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. No major surgeries or hospitalizations, other than a broken arm as a child. Now, let's talk about your family. Is there any history of heart disease, high blood pressure, stroke, or diabetes in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… family history. That’s a hard one, Doctor. My mother… she died when I was young. From something with her heart, I think. But I don’t remember much about it. She was sick for a long time. My father, he lived a long life, but he was always… strong and silent. He didn’t go to the doctor much. And my brothers and sisters… they mostly just get colds, you know? Nothing serious. I don’t think there’s much heart trouble in my family. But I’m not sure. It was a long time ago, and we didn’t talk about these things much.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of heart issues with your mother, but not much known beyond that. We'll keep that in mind. Now, just a few more questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: Oh, no, Doctor. Never smoked. I don't like the smell! My husband used to smoke, a long time ago, but he stopped when we got married. He said he wanted to be healthy for me. He’s a good man. No, no smoking. Never have, never will. It’s bad for you, you know?
DOCTOR: That’s excellent. And how much alcohol do you typically drink?
PATIENT: Alcohol… hmm. Not much, Doctor. Sometimes, on Sundays, my husband and I have a little glass of wine with dinner. Just one glass. And maybe on special occasions, like Christmas, we have a little more. But mostly, we drink water. Or coffee! I love my coffee. Not much alcohol, mostly just wine on Sundays. Is that okay?
DOCTOR: That sounds perfectly reasonable, Sherion. Now, one final question about allergies – are you allergic to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… let me think. No, Doctor, I don’t think so. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything. Sometimes, I get a little itchy when I eat shrimp, but it’s not bad. Just a little itch. Nothing serious. And no allergies to any medicines that I know of. I can take most things, I think. No, no allergies. I’m pretty lucky that way.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s very good. No known allergies. Alright, Sherion, I'm just going to review your chart here to see what information we already have. I see you’ve had some visits for your arthritis, and a recent wellness check-up. Your blood pressure was a little elevated at that check-up, but nothing too concerning. Now, based on what you’ve told me, and what I'm seeing here, it sounds like you're experiencing symptoms that could be related to angina – chest pain caused by reduced blood flow to the heart. However, we need to investigate further to be sure. I'd like to listen to your heart and lungs, and then I think an EKG would be a good idea. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Angina? That sounds scary, Doctor. What is that? And an… EKG? Will that hurt? I don’t want anything painful. I just want to know what’s going on with my chest. I don’t like feeling scared. If you think it's important, then yes, I’ll do whatever you think is best. But please, no pain! And explain it to me, so I understand. I get nervous easily, you know? What will the EKG show?
DOCTOR: It’s understandable to be nervous, Sherion. Angina isn’t necessarily something to panic about, but it is something we need to take seriously. It's a symptom of reduced blood flow to the heart, often caused by narrowing of the arteries. It usually feels like a squeezing, tightness, or pressure in the chest, which you’ve described perfectly. And an EKG – that stands for electrocardiogram – is a very simple, painless test. We attach small stickers, called electrodes, to your chest, arms, and legs. These stickers detect the electrical activity of your heart and show us if there are any irregularities or signs of reduced blood flow. It doesn’t hurt at all, you won’t feel anything. It's like taking a picture of your heart’s electrical signals. The EKG will help us see if there are any changes in your heart rhythm, or signs of previous heart attacks or blockages. It's a quick and easy way to get a lot of information. Would you like me to explain anything further before we proceed?
PATIENT: Okay… okay. That sounds… less scary when you explain it like that. Stickers, not needles? Good. And it’s just a picture, you say? I’m still worried, Doctor. But I guess I need to know, right? If it's just a picture, then yes, go ahead. But be gentle, please. I bruise easily, you know. And explain everything to me as you go. I want to understand what you’re doing, so I don’t get scared. And what if… what if it is something bad? What happens then?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Sherion. I'll be very gentle, and I’ll explain everything as I go. And you're right to ask what happens if it is something concerning. If the EKG shows any abnormalities, we’ll likely order some further tests – maybe a blood test to check for heart enzymes, or an echocardiogram, which is an ultrasound of the heart. We might also refer you to a cardiologist, a heart specialist. The good news is, even if it is something like angina, there are many effective treatments available – medications to improve blood flow, lifestyle changes to reduce your risk, and even procedures to open up blocked arteries. We’ll cross that bridge if we come to it. Right now, let's just focus on getting the EKG done. First, I’m going to have you lie back on the examination table. Then, I'll clean a few small areas on your chest, arms, and legs with an alcohol wipe. Then, I’ll attach these small stickers. It might feel a little cool, but it shouldn’t hurt. It takes just a few minutes to set everything up. Are you ready?
PATIENT: Okay… alcohol wipes, okay. Not needles, good. Just stickers. I’m still nervous, Doctor. But I’ll try. Just… be quick, please. And tell me what you’re doing as you go, okay? I don't like surprises. And what if I feel scared during the test? Can I stop it? Will I feel anything? I worry too much, I know, but it helps me feel better if I know what’s coming. Just… take it slow.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Sherion. We’ll take it very slow, and I’ll explain everything every step of the way. And you can absolutely stop the test at any time if you feel uncomfortable. I’m just cleaning a small patch of skin on your arm now, so the stickers will stick properly. It will feel cool for just a moment. Now, I'm attaching this sticker. It’s just like a little patch, and it won't hurt. It's detecting the electrical signals from your heart. I’m doing the same thing on your right arm now, and then we’ll do your legs. It might feel a little cool, but it shouldn’t be painful. Okay, everything is in place now. The machine will record your heart’s activity for a few moments. Just try to relax and breathe normally. I’ll be right here the whole time. Just relax, Sherion. The machine is recording now. You might hear a few beeps, but that’s perfectly normal. Just breathe normally. This will only take a few minutes.
PATIENT: Beep… beep… It feels strange, Doctor. Like something is watching me. What are you looking at? Is it bad? My heart feels like it's beating too fast. Is that normal? Can I close my eyes? I don’t want to see the machine. It scares me. Just tell me when it's over, please. And… is it bad if my heart is beating fast? Please, tell me something good. Is everything okay so far?
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly normal to feel a little anxious during the test, Sherion. And yes, it’s perfectly fine to close your eyes. That will probably help you relax. Your heart is beating a little faster, but that's understandable given your anxiety. It doesn’t necessarily mean anything is wrong. I’m just looking at the rhythm of your heart on the screen. So far, everything looks… unremarkable. We’re just getting a baseline reading right now. It’s like taking a snapshot of your heart’s activity. Just breathe deeply, Sherion. In… and out… We’re almost done. Just a few more seconds… You’re doing great. Okay, we’re finished! The recording is complete. That’s all done. It was just a quick snapshot of your heart’s activity. Now, I need a few moments to review the results. Just give me a minute, okay?
PATIENT: Okay… finished. Good. That was scary. What did it show? Is it bad? Please, tell me the truth, Doctor. I’d rather know, even if it’s not good. I’m a strong woman, I can handle it. Just… don't make me wait too long. My heart is racing just thinking about it. Is everything okay? Please… tell me something.
DOCTOR: Okay, Sherion. I’ve had a look at the EKG. The good news is, there are no immediate signs of a heart attack. I don’t see any major abnormalities in your heart rhythm. However… I do see some slight changes that could suggest some reduced blood flow to the heart. These changes are subtle, and they aren't necessarily cause for alarm, but they do warrant further investigation. I’d like to order a few blood tests to check for cardiac enzymes. These enzymes are released into the bloodstream when heart muscle is damaged. We also might want to consider an echocardiogram, which is an ultrasound of the heart, to get a better look at its structure and function. These tests will help us determine if you have angina, or if these changes are due to something else. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Angina… you said that before. Is that bad? What does it mean? And blood tests… more tests? I’m tired of tests, Doctor. I just want to know what’s going on with my chest. Is it my heart? Am I going to be sick? What will happen if it is angina? Will I need… surgery? Please, Doctor. Tell me the truth. And tell me what will happen next. I need to know. I’m a little scared, you know? I don't want to die. Is it serious?
DOCTOR: Sherion, it’s understandable to be scared. And I want to assure you, I'm here to help you every step of the way. Angina isn’t a disease in itself, but it’s a symptom of underlying heart disease. It means your heart muscle isn't getting enough oxygen-rich blood. This is often caused by narrowed arteries, which reduce blood flow. It’s not necessarily serious right away, but it is a warning sign that needs to be investigated. And it’s something we need to manage to prevent more serious problems in the future. The blood tests will help us see if there’s any evidence of heart muscle damage. And the echocardiogram will give us a better look at your heart’s structure and function. If it turns out you have angina, there are many effective treatments available. These can include medications to improve blood flow, lifestyle changes to reduce your risk factors, and, in some cases, procedures to open up blocked arteries. Surgery is rarely the first step. We'll start with conservative treatments and see how you respond. And I will explain everything to you every step of the way. You're not alone in this, Sherion. We'll work together to get to the bottom of this and make sure you're healthy and comfortable. Would you like me to explain any of that in more detail?
PATIENT: Okay… okay. So, not necessarily bad right away. That’s good. And medicine… not surgery right away. That’s good too. But what kind of medicine? Will it make me feel sick? And what kind of lifestyle changes? Do I have to stop eating my coffee? I love my coffee, Doctor. And will I have to… exercise? I don’t have much energy, you know. And what if the tests are bad? What will happen then? Please, be honest with me. I need to know. I’m scared, but I want to be prepared. Tell me everything, Doctor. What’s the worst that could happen? And what will you do to help me?
DOCTOR: Okay, Sherion. Let’s talk about the potential treatments and what to expect. If the tests confirm angina, the first line of treatment is usually medication. There are several types of medications we might consider. Beta-blockers can slow your heart rate and lower your blood pressure, reducing the strain on your heart. Nitroglycerin can help open up your blood vessels and relieve chest pain. Statins can lower your cholesterol levels, reducing the buildup of plaque in your arteries. Side effects vary depending on the medication, but many people tolerate them well. We’ll start with a low dose and gradually increase it as needed, monitoring your response carefully. And if you experience any side effects, we can always adjust the dosage or try a different medication. As for lifestyle changes, it’s important to eat a healthy diet, rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. Reducing your salt and sugar intake is also important. Regular exercise is beneficial, but we’ll start slowly and gradually increase your activity level as you get stronger. And yes, you don’t necessarily have to stop drinking coffee, but reducing your caffeine intake might be helpful. Now, as for the worst-case scenario… if the angina is severe and doesn’t respond to medication, we might consider more invasive procedures, such as angioplasty or bypass surgery. Angioplasty involves inserting a small balloon into a blocked artery to open it up. Bypass surgery involves creating a new pathway for blood flow around a blocked artery. But let’s not jump to conclusions. We’ll cross that bridge if we come to it. Right now, let’s focus on getting the tests done and seeing what they reveal. And I promise you, I will be with you every step of the way. I’ll explain everything in detail, answer all your questions, and make sure you feel comfortable and informed. We will work together to get to the bottom of this and develop a treatment plan that’s right for you. Now, would you like me to schedule the blood tests and echocardiogram?
PATIENT: Okay… okay. Medicine and lifestyle changes. Not surgery right away. That’s good. And you’ll be with me every step of the way. That makes me feel better, Doctor. Yes, please. Schedule the tests. I want to know what’s going on with my chest. And can I bring my husband with me? He worries about me, and it would be nice to have him there for support. And… thank you, Doctor. For being honest with me. And for being patient. I ask a lot of questions, I know. But it helps me feel better when I know what’s going on.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Sherion. Of course, you can bring your husband with you. Having support is very important. And please, don’t worry about asking questions. It’s my job to make sure you understand everything and feel comfortable with the treatment plan. I’m happy to answer any questions you have, no matter how small. Okay, let me see… I can schedule the blood tests for tomorrow morning at 9:00 AM. And the echocardiogram can be done on Wednesday afternoon at 2:00 PM. Does that work for you and your husband?
PATIENT: Yes, that works. Tomorrow morning and Wednesday afternoon. That’s good. Thank you, Doctor. I feel a little better now, knowing what to expect. And… is there anything I should do before the tests? Anything I should avoid eating or drinking? Or anything I should wear? I want to be prepared. I don’t want to mess anything up.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Sherion. It’s good you’re asking. For the blood tests tomorrow, you can eat a normal breakfast, but please avoid caffeine for a few hours beforehand. You don’t need to do anything special with your clothing, just wear comfortable clothes. And for the echocardiogram on Wednesday, you might be asked to wear a gown, but we’ll provide one for you. It’s helpful to avoid caffeine on Wednesday morning as well. It's a painless test, but it's helpful if you're relaxed. Here's a number you can call if you have any questions or concerns before the tests. Don't hesitate to call, even if it seems small. Now, is there anything else I can help you with today, Sherion?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you so much, Doctor. You’ve been very helpful. And patient. I really appreciate it. I’ll see you tomorrow morning then. And thank you again. You've made me feel a lot better. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Sherion. I'm glad I could help. Remember, don't hesitate to call if you have any questions. I’ll see you tomorrow morning. .
