DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Astore. Welcome. I'm Dr. Polczynski. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. Please, call me Dorman. Well, it’s… hard to explain exactly. I’ve just been getting weaker, little by little. It's not a sudden thing, you see. Been going on for a while now. The other doctors, they say it's… something with the nerves. Multiple Sclerosis, I think they called it.
DOCTOR: Okay, Dorman. Multiple Sclerosis… right. And you said this weakness has been coming on gradually?
PATIENT: Yes, that's right. It started in my legs, I think. Just felt a little clumsy, you know? Then it moved to my hands. Now, even talking sometimes feels… tiring. It’s not painful, not usually, just… difficult. It makes it hard to do things I used to do, like help my wife with the garden. She does most of it now.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it started with clumsiness in the legs, progressed to the hands, and now you're noticing fatigue with speech. Has the weakness been getting worse steadily, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. I think… it comes and goes a little. Some days are better than others. But, on the whole, it's been getting worse, slowly. It’s hard to tell sometimes, to be honest. Some good days make me think I’m okay, and then… a bad day reminds me. It's frustrating.
DOCTOR: I understand. That fluctuating nature can be very frustrating. And to clarify, you mentioned fatigue with speech… can you describe what that feels like exactly?
PATIENT: Well, it’s not like being sleepy, not exactly. It’s like… my tongue gets heavy, maybe? And my mouth feels slow. It takes more effort to say things, and sometimes the words don’t come out right. It's not all the time, just when I'm talking for a while, or if I try to say something complicated. I have to think harder about what I want to say, and even then… it doesn’t always work. My wife says I slur sometimes, but I don’t always notice.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. Tongue feels heavy, slurred speech… I see. Have you noticed any difficulty with swallowing, or any changes in your vision?
PATIENT: Now that you mention it… my vision has been a little blurry sometimes. Not all the time, and it comes and goes, like the weakness. It’s hard to explain. It's like looking through a fog, maybe? And, yes… I think I have a little trouble swallowing sometimes. Not with everything, just… thicker foods. Like oatmeal, or mashed potatoes. Water is fine.
DOCTOR: Okay, blurry vision and difficulty with thicker foods… That all gives me a clearer picture. Now, just to get a bit of background, have you been seeing any other doctors regularly for this?
PATIENT: Yes, I have. Dr. Lawson, over at the City Hospital. He's the one who told me about the Multiple Sclerosis. I see him every few months, but he's… very busy. It’s hard to get all my questions answered, you see. He does the tests, tells me what's happening, but… I feel like he doesn’t have much time to explain things. That's why I thought I'd come see you, if that's alright.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Dorman. It’s good you came in. It's important to feel heard and have your questions answered. I’ll take a look at Dr. Lawson’s notes. Before we do that though, can you tell me a little bit about any other medical conditions you have, or have had in the past?
PATIENT: Well, I had a little trouble with my heart a few years back, but they put a stent in and it’s been fine since then. No other major problems, really. I used to be very active, played a lot of rugby when I was younger, but that was a long time ago. I have high blood pressure, Dr. Lawson says, and I take medicine for that. And… arthritis in my knees, but that’s just old age, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of heart issues with a stent placement, high blood pressure, and arthritis. Do you know what medications you're currently taking for your high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Let me think… Dr. Lawson changes them sometimes. I believe it’s… Lisinopril? Yes, that sounds right. Lisinopril, once a day. And a little white pill for the arthritis, but I don't know the name of that one. I just take it when my knees are bothering me.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril for blood pressure and something for arthritis as needed. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. Never had a problem with allergies. My wife tries to give me honey when I have a cold, but that's just a wife's thing, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright, good to know. Now, before we move on, could you tell me a little about your family history?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. My mother had diabetes, I think. And my brother, he had some trouble with his nerves when he got older, but I don’t know exactly what it was. Nothing else that I can think of, really. We didn't talk about health much when I was growing up.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a family history of diabetes and some nerve issues in your brother. Now, let’s do a quick physical exam, if that's alright. It'll just help me get a better understanding of what's going on. Can you stand up for me?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Happy to. It feels a little wobbly today, if I'm honest. But I can stand.
DOCTOR: Alright, just take your time. I’m going to check your blood pressure, pulse, and listen to your heart and lungs. Then I’ll do a quick neurological exam – check your reflexes, balance, and coordination. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, 150/90. We’ll keep an eye on that. Pulse is good and regular at 72. Heart sounds are normal, lungs are clear. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. Can you sit back down for me?
PATIENT: Yes, alright. 150/90, you say? That doesn’t surprise me. I worry a lot, maybe that’s it. Go ahead, doctor. Check whatever you need to check. I trust your judgment.
DOCTOR: Okay, reflexes are a little diminished in both legs, which isn’t unexpected given what you’ve described. Now, I’m going to ask you to close your eyes and point your finger to your nose. Can you do that for me?
PATIENT: Yes, I can do that. Is that alright? My hands are a little shaky today.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Astore. A little bit of difficulty and some shakiness is understandable. Now, can you stand up again, if you're able?
PATIENT: Yes, I can. Slowly, mind you. It's a little hard to balance, if I’m honest. Don't want to fall.
DOCTOR: That's good to know. I'm right here, so don’t worry about falling. I’m just going to check your gait - how you walk. Can you take a few steps for me?
PATIENT: Alright. It feels… awkward. I used to walk so much straighter.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you, Mr. Astore. That was helpful. Your gait is a little wider than normal, and you do have a bit of a shuffling quality to your steps. Based on everything so far, your symptoms are consistent with a possible progression of Multiple Sclerosis, as Dr. Lawson has indicated. However, it’s important to rule out other possibilities. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order some blood tests to check for vitamin deficiencies and other conditions that can mimic MS. I also recommend an MRI of your brain and spinal cord, if you haven't had one recently, to look for any changes. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: That sounds… sensible. I trust your judgment, doctor. If tests will help us figure out what’s going on, then yes, please. I haven’t had an MRI in a while, I don’t think. Blood tests are fine too. Anything to get a better understanding. It's just… tiring, always being tested. But I understand it’s necessary.
DOCTOR: I understand it’s tiring, Mr. Astore. But it's the best way to get a definitive answer. I’ll send the orders to the lab now, and they’ll contact you to schedule the blood tests and the MRI. Once we have the results, we can discuss them and create a plan. In the meantime, is there anything I can do to help manage your symptoms?
PATIENT: Well… it's little things. Just getting around the house is hard some days. And the tiredness, it’s awful. I suppose… if there’s anything to help with the tiredness, that would be good. And maybe something to help my balance? I don't want to fall and hurt myself.
DOCTOR: Okay. For the fatigue, we can explore some lifestyle modifications - pacing yourself throughout the day, getting enough rest, and avoiding overexertion. I can also refer you to a physical therapist who can teach you exercises to improve your strength and balance. As for the balance, the PT will be a big help there. We can also discuss assistive devices, like a cane or walker, if needed. I’ll write you a referral to physical therapy now. And I'll also give you a list of resources for people living with Multiple Sclerosis. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Physical therapy sounds good. Very good, actually. And a list of resources… yes, that would be helpful. It’s nice to know you're not alone, you know? No… I think that’s all for now. Thank you, doctor. You’ve been very patient and kind.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Astore. I’m glad I could help. I’ll have the nurse print out those resources for you, and we’ll get the referral to physical therapy sent over. Please don't hesitate to contact the office if you have any questions or concerns before your next appointment. We’re here to support you. It was a pleasure meeting you.
PATIENT: The pleasure was all mine, Doctor. Thank you again for your time and attention. I appreciate it very much. I’ll be in touch if I have any questions. Have a good day.
DOCTOR: You too, Mr. Astore. Take care. .
