DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Altine. I’m Dr. Nestingen. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Look, I haven't got all day, so let's just get this over with. It's my stomach. Food keeps… coming back up. It's unpleasant, really. And it’s been happening more and more lately.
DOCTOR: Alright. “Food coming back up,” you say. And more frequent recently. Can you describe what this “coming back up” looks like?
PATIENT: Honestly, do I have to describe it? It’s… well, it’s what it sounds like. Digested food. Sometimes it’s just a little, sometimes more. It’s not pretty, and frankly, I don’t see why I need to go into graphic detail for you. It tastes…bad. Like, really bad. Is that enough?
DOCTOR: Yes, yes, that’s… sufficient. When did this start happening, roughly?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… it started… well, probably around last fall, maybe? September, October-ish. It wasn’t constant then, just… now and then after a big meal. But like I said, it’s gotten worse. Much worse. I ate a perfectly good pierogi last night and… well, you can imagine. A waste of good food, that’s what it is.
DOCTOR: So, starting around September or October, intermittent episodes, now increasing in frequency. Do you notice anything before these episodes?
PATIENT: Before? Hmm. Well, usually I’m just… full. I enjoy a good meal, you see. I don't skimp on portions. And sometimes… sometimes I lie down a little soon after eating. Not right away, mind you, but maybe an hour or so. Is that a problem? Everyone needs a little rest after a good dinner.
DOCTOR: Lying down soon after eating… alright. And is this happening with all meals, or just certain ones?
PATIENT: Mostly the bigger ones. Breakfast is usually fine, a little toast, coffee. Lunch, if it’s just a sandwich, I’m okay. It’s the dinners, the proper meals with meat and potatoes and… well, you know. Polish food. It's substantial. It’s not like you youngsters with your salads.
DOCTOR: I see. And do you experience any other symptoms along with this?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Like what? A headache? No. Fever? Definitely not. I'm a healthy man, mostly. Though my wife keeps telling me I need to lose a few pounds, but that’s neither here nor there. Sometimes… sometimes there's a bit of a burning feeling in my chest, right here. But that could just be heartburn, I suppose. It happens.
DOCTOR: Burning sensation in the chest… alright. Do you take anything for that heartburn, or any other medications at all?
PATIENT: No, I don't take anything. Never been one for pills. My mother always said they’re worse than the illness. And I’ve always managed just fine on my own. A little water, a little common sense. That’s all you need. You try to get me started on modern medicine, you’ll be here all day. It's all overpriced nonsense, if you ask me.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, Mr. Altine, it sounds like you’ve been experiencing progressively worsening episodes of vomiting, particularly after larger meals, with some associated heartburn. I’m going to do a quick physical exam, just to get a better sense of things. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Oh, for goodness sake. Must you? I haven’t got all day, you know. Very well, get it over with. But be quick about it. I have things to do. And don't go poking around too much. I'm a delicate man.
DOCTOR: Very well. Please lie back on the examination table. I'll listen to your abdomen first. I'm listening for bowel sounds now… They appear normal, within expected range. Now, I’m going to gently palpate your abdomen. Let me know if anything is particularly tender. Any pain here?
PATIENT: A little bit. Right there. Not terrible, but… yeah, that's a bit uncomfortable. You're pressing rather hard, aren't you? It's not like I'm a rock. Just a gentle poke, I thought you said? Honestly, you're making it worse now. This is ridiculous.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. That’s sufficient. No need to continue if it’s causing discomfort. Tenderness to palpation in the upper abdomen. It sounds like this could be several things, Mr. Altine. Given your symptoms and the tenderness, I’m concerned about potential gastritis or possibly a hiatal hernia. I would like to order a blood test to check for inflammation, and I recommend an upper endoscopy to visualize your esophagus, stomach, and duodenum. It's the most accurate way to determine the cause of your symptoms. What do you think?
PATIENT: Endoscopy? You want to stick a camera down my throat? Absolutely not! That sounds… barbaric. Blood test, maybe. I suppose I can tolerate a little needle prick. But no cameras. No poking around. I’m not having any of it. That's ridiculous. Just give me something for the heartburn, and I’ll be on my way. Honestly, the things they come up with these days… .
DOCTOR: Mr. Altine, I understand your reluctance, but an endoscopy is crucial for accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment. Without it, we’re simply guessing. I strongly advise against foregoing it. However… I can prescribe a proton pump inhibitor to reduce stomach acid and hopefully alleviate your heartburn symptoms. But this is only a temporary solution. And without knowing the underlying cause, the problem could worsen. If your symptoms don't improve significantly within two weeks, or if they worsen, you must reconsider the endoscopy. I can also provide a referral to a gastroenterologist if you would like a second opinion. Do you want a prescription for the medication?
