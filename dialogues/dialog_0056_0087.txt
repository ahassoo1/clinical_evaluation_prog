DOCTOR: Hi Mr. Croonquist, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Amussen. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. Just… some lab work, if you don’t mind. I don’t really remember why exactly, to be honest. Medicare said I needed it done. Gets confusing, you know? Just want to get it over with, if that’s alright.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Croonquist. It can be a lot to keep track of. Let me pull up your record here… Okay, it looks like this is a routine annual check-up ordered by your primary care physician, Dr. Sharma. It includes a basic metabolic panel, a lipid panel, and a complete blood count. Do any of those names ring a bell?
PATIENT: Sharma… Sharma… vaguely. Look, I don’t mean to be difficult, Doctor, I just… my memory isn't what it used to be. Panels… sounds like something you fix cars with. Is it going to hurt? Just want to be sure. I've had enough poking and prodding in my life, you know?
DOCTOR: No, not at all, Mr. Croonquist. It definitely doesn’t involve cars! It’s just a standard blood test. We’ll take a small sample, and it shouldn’t hurt much more than a quick pinch. It helps us get a snapshot of how things are running internally – things like your kidney function, cholesterol, and blood cell counts. Before we do that though, just to be thorough, can you tell me about any medical conditions you have, or have had in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s a tough one. Let me think… I used to work at the power plant, you know? Lots of… things there. Exposure to… well, everything, I suppose. I had a bad knee once, playing football. A long time ago. And… I think I had the flu a couple of times. Honestly, Doctor, it's all a bit of a blur. I really don’t keep track of these things. Do you need specifics? Because I’m drawing a blank.
DOCTOR: Okay, no worries at all, Mr. Croonquist. The power plant history is good to know – we’ll definitely keep that in mind. Even “a bit of a blur” is helpful. Any surgeries you remember having?
PATIENT: Surgeries… hmm. Now that’s a good question. I think… maybe something with my appendix when I was a kid? Or was that my cousin? Honestly, I can't be certain. It was a long, long time ago, and everything feels… mixed up. I don’t recall ever having anything major done, if that helps. Mostly just bumps and bruises from working, you know? And that knee. Still bothers me sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, possible appendectomy, but unsure. And knee issues. Good to know. Any family history of medical problems that you're aware of?
PATIENT: Family… oh dear. My brother… he had something with his heart, I think. Years ago. Passed away. And my mother… she lived a long life, thankfully, but she had… well, old age things, you know? Weak bones. Arthritis. Nothing specific I can really point to. We weren’t really a family for sharing medical details, if you catch my drift. Kept to ourselves mostly. This is all probably useless information, isn’t it? I apologize for being so vague. I really just want to get this lab work done.
DOCTOR: No, not useless at all, Mr. Croonquist. It all helps build a picture. Heart problems in your brother and your mother’s arthritis are good things to know. And honestly, it’s perfectly understandable to not have all the details. Before we move on to the blood work, just a couple of quick questions. Are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Medications… let me see. Just a little something for my knee, sometimes. When it really flares up. Some kind of pain reliever. Ibuprofen, maybe? Or naproxen? Honestly, I can’t recall the name. I get them at the drugstore, over the counter. Nothing prescribed, if that makes a difference. I don't like taking pills unless I absolutely have to, you know? They make me feel… foggy.
DOCTOR: Okay, over-the-counter pain relievers for your knee, as needed. That’s helpful. And any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Not that I know of. I’ve never really had a bad reaction to anything, thankfully. I eat pretty much everything. I think I might have gotten a little itchy once from a bee sting when I was a kid, but that wasn’t a full-blown allergy, just a bit of discomfort. No, I don’t think I have any serious allergies. Hopefully, that’s one less thing to worry about. Can we get this over with now? I'm starting to feel a bit… anxious.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Croonquist. We can get right to it. It will be quick. Before we do, just so I'm clear – you are generally healthy, with a history of working at a power plant, occasional knee pain managed with over-the-counter pain relievers, and no known allergies?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds about right. Power plant, knee, no allergies. I think you've got it all. Let’s just get it done, please. The sooner this is over, the better. I've got things to do, you know? Old man things.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Croonquist. Let’s head over to the lab. It will just take a few minutes. I'll be right with you. And if you feel any discomfort at all during the blood draw, please let the phlebotomist know immediately.
PATIENT: Alright. Lead the way, Doctor. I’m ready to get this over with. And I appreciate your patience, truly. It’s hard remembering things these days.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Croonquist. It’s my job. We’ll get these tests done, and hopefully, everything will be fine. I'll be right here once you're finished, and we can discuss the results when they come back. Don’t hesitate to let me know if you need anything at all.
PATIENT: .
