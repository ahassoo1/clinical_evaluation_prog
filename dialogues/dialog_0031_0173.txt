DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Aslan. My name is Dr. Rakosky. It’s good to meet you. Can you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hi Dr. Rakosky, nice to meet you too. Well, I've been having these chills… it's kinda weird. Not a fever, not really sick feeling, just… cold. Like, shivers, you know?
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. Shivers, feeling cold… and you haven’t felt generally unwell beyond that?
PATIENT: No, not really. I mean, a little tired maybe, but I've been busy at work, so that could just be that. It's just the chills are… persistent. They come and go, but they've been happening for a few days now.
DOCTOR: Okay. A few days of intermittent chills, with some mild fatigue. Can you tell me a bit more about when these chills started?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It started, I think, last Thursday? So, like, four days ago? I was at a conference for work, actually. It was pretty hectic, lots of people, different food… I don’t know if that has anything to do with it.
DOCTOR: Okay, Thursday. And you were at a conference with a lot of people and different foods. Were the chills constant while you were at the conference, or did they start after you returned home?
PATIENT: I think they started at the conference, actually. I remember feeling a bit cold in the big meeting rooms, but I just figured it was the air conditioning. It wasn't bad enough to say anything, you know? It’s gotten a little more noticeable since I got back, though.
DOCTOR: Alright. So chills started at the conference, possibly related to air conditioning, and have been a little more pronounced since returning home. Besides the chills and fatigue, have you noticed any other symptoms – body aches, headache, sore throat, cough, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or anything like that?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. Honestly, that’s what’s so strange about it. I don’t feel sick, just…cold. No headache, no sore throat, nothing. And my stomach’s been fine. It's just… unsettling to feel cold when it's not even that cold out, you know?
DOCTOR: Yes, that is unusual. Okay. Let's move on to some general health questions. Do you have any known medical conditions, like diabetes, high blood pressure, or thyroid problems?
PATIENT: No, not really. I mean, I had a bit of trouble with my weight a few years back, but I've been working on it. Other than that, I'm pretty healthy. No high blood pressure, no thyroid issues… just… normal, I guess.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. And have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: No, never had surgery. I'm not a fan, to be honest! I've been lucky so far, haven’t needed any. Just the usual check-ups and stuff, nothing major.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… my mom has high blood pressure, and my dad had some heart trouble when he was older, but nothing really… close. Like, no one with anything contagious or anything. Just normal aging stuff, I think. Is that helpful? I’m not sure what you’re looking for.
DOCTOR: That is helpful, thank you. Knowing about your parents' health is useful. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a multivitamin, honestly. And sometimes I take ibuprofen if I have a headache, but not regularly. Really, that’s it. I try to stay pretty natural, you know? Nothing prescribed or anything.
DOCTOR: Okay, just a multivitamin and occasional ibuprofen. And do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope, no allergies that I know of. I eat everything, I haven’t had any problems with food… and I haven't reacted to any medications before. I'm pretty boring allergy-wise, thankfully!
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, I'd like to ask a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, none of that. I don't smoke, I hardly ever drink – maybe a glass of wine once in a blue moon – and definitely no drugs. I try to be healthy! So, no, nothing like that.
DOCTOR: Okay, very good. Now, before we proceed, just to confirm, you said your weight has been a bit of a concern in the past, and you're working on it. About what weight are you currently?
PATIENT: Oh, um… well, I try not to dwell on it too much. But I think… around 70 kilos? Give or take. It fluctuates, you know? I'm not super precise about it, but yeah, around 70 kilos. And I'm 153 centimeters tall.
DOCTOR: Okay, 70 kilograms and 153 centimeters. Thank you. Now, Ms. Aslan, to get a better understanding of what might be going on, I'd like to perform a brief physical examination. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that's fine. Whatever you think is best. I'm happy to do whatever you need.
DOCTOR: Alright. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs first. Please take a deep breath in… and out… again… and out. Listens with stethoscope. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Now, I'm going to check your temperature. Your temperature is 36.8 degrees Celsius – which is normal. I'll also palpate your lymph nodes and check your abdomen. Your lymph nodes feel normal, and your abdomen is soft. Do you feel any pain when I press here?
PATIENT: No, that doesn't hurt. Everything feels okay. It’s just… strange that everything seems normal, you know? That’s why I'm worried. It doesn’t feel like anything's wrong, but I keep getting these chills.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand your concern. It is good that the physical exam is unremarkable. Given your intermittent chills, the normal temperature, and the absence of other symptoms, a few possibilities come to mind. It could be a mild viral infection that isn't fully manifesting, or possibly related to stress or fatigue, although you mentioned you've been managing that. Sometimes, hormonal fluctuations can also cause similar symptoms. To rule out anything more serious, I'd like to order a complete blood count and a thyroid-stimulating hormone test. These tests will help us assess your overall health and rule out any underlying infections or thyroid issues. Does that sound agreeable to you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good. Whatever you think is best to figure out what’s going on. A blood test sounds fine. Is it something I can do here? And will it take long to get the results? I have a pretty busy schedule next week.
DOCTOR: Yes, we can draw the blood samples here in the clinic. It will only take a few minutes. The lab usually takes about 2-3 business days to process the results, so we should have them by Wednesday or Thursday of next week. Once we have the results, we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and determine the best course of action. In the meantime, I recommend getting plenty of rest and staying hydrated. If the chills worsen or you develop any new symptoms, such as fever, body aches, or sore throat, please contact the clinic immediately. Does that sound like a reasonable plan?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfect. Rest and hydration, and I’ll wait for the results. And I’ll call if anything changes. Thank you, Dr. Rakosky. I appreciate you taking the time to listen.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Aslan. I'm glad I could help. We'll get those tests ordered right away, and we'll be in touch as soon as we have the results. A nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood. Have a good day, and please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns.
