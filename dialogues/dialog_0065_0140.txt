DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Schieber. I’m Dr. Duplichan. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Honestly, I don’t have a lot of time for this. It’s…well, it’s a bit embarrassing, but I seem to have a…coating in my mouth. A white one. It’s unpleasant. I assumed it would just go away, but it hasn’t.
DOCTOR: A coating, you say. And you’ve noticed this for how long?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think. Perhaps…a week? Maybe a little longer. It’s not as though I spend my days examining the inside of my mouth, you understand. I have a job to do. It just…became noticeable. It’s mostly on the tongue, I think. And it’s not painful, exactly, just…there. Annoying, mostly.
DOCTOR: "Mostly annoying," right. Well, we still need to determine the cause. Is it constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Constant. Yes, definitely constant. It doesn’t disappear after I eat, or drink, or…anything. I’ve tried rinsing, but it doesn’t seem to make a difference. Really, I just hoped it would resolve itself. I don’t understand why I need to be here about this. Is it contagious, Doctor? My wife would be furious if I gave her something.
DOCTOR: Contagious is a valid concern, but it’s unlikely with what you’re describing so far. Let’s focus on gathering more information. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with this coating?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Well, no. Not really. I feel…fine. A bit tired, perhaps, but that's just work. I'm a faller, you know. It’s physically demanding. I haven’t had a fever or anything like that. Just this…irritation. And, frankly, it’s wasting my time. Is there a quick fix for this, Doctor? I really don’t have the patience for a drawn-out investigation.
DOCTOR: A “quick fix” is rarely possible when we're trying to understand what’s going on internally, Mr. Schieber. It's important to be thorough. Have you had any changes in your diet recently?
PATIENT: Changes in my diet? No. My wife does the cooking. It’s always the same. Rice, beans, some sort of meat. She’s very…traditional. I eat what she puts in front of me. I haven’t been experimenting with exotic fruits or anything like that. Honestly, I'm a fairly simple man with simple needs. This is getting ridiculous.
DOCTOR: Right. And you mentioned being a faller – what kind of work do you do, exactly?
PATIENT: I cut trees. Felling trees, hauling timber. It's hard work, as I said. I’ve been doing it for twenty years. It requires strength and…discipline. We use a lot of tools, obviously. Chainsaws, axes…the usual. I’m careful, of course. A man has to be careful in my profession. But it's not a sterile environment, if you understand what I mean. Dust, dirt, that sort of thing. I’m exposed to a lot. And, again, I don’t have time for this.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s take a look at your mouth. Please open wide for me. I need to examine your tongue and the lining of your mouth. It's necessary to determine the cause of this coating.
PATIENT: Fine. But be quick about it, Doctor. I have things to do. And try not to poke too much. It’s…uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Hmm. I see a white coating on your tongue, as you described. It appears somewhat patchy, and I do notice a few areas of redness underneath. There doesn't appear to be any active lesions, thankfully. Your gums also appear slightly inflamed. Do you practice good oral hygiene, Mr. Schieber?
PATIENT: Good oral hygiene? Of course! I brush my teeth every morning. And sometimes at night, if I remember. It’s not as though I live in a cave! I use…a normal toothbrush. And toothpaste. What do you take me for? This is insulting, Doctor. I'm a hardworking man, not a…a neglectful child. My wife would be appalled if she heard you suggesting such a thing.
DOCTOR: I didn’t mean to imply neglect, Mr. Schieber. However, brushing alone isn’t always sufficient. Do you use floss or any other interdental cleaning tools?
PATIENT: Floss? No. Never. What is this, an interrogation? I cut trees for a living, I don't have time to…to fiddle with string! Look, I'm telling you, it's probably just something I ate. Some sort of…temporary irritation. I’m sure it will go away on its own. I fail to see why we're wasting both our time on this trivial matter. Is there anything you can prescribe to just…make it disappear?
DOCTOR: Mr. Schieber, I understand your frustration, but dismissing it as “something you ate” without proper investigation is not responsible medical care. Given your occupation and the appearance of the coating, and the lack of improvement with basic hygiene, I suspect this might be something beyond a simple irritation. It could be a fungal infection, oral lichen planus, or even a reaction to something you're exposed to in your work environment. To rule out other possibilities, I’d like to order a few tests: a complete blood count, a fungal culture of the oral mucosa, and possibly a biopsy of the affected area. Would you be willing to proceed with those?
PATIENT: Tests? A biopsy? Are you serious, Doctor? You want to cut pieces out of my mouth? Absolutely not. I told you, it's nothing. A temporary irritation. I'm not subjecting myself to invasive procedures based on your…speculations. This is ridiculous. I’m leaving. I'll just wait and see if it goes away on its own. It always does. Waste of my time.
DOCTOR: Mr. Schieber, I strongly advise against that course of action. Ignoring this could lead to complications. However, I respect your decision. I will document your refusal of testing and my recommendation for follow-up. I am concerned about the possibility of a secondary infection or an underlying condition that could worsen with time. Should your symptoms worsen – if you experience pain, difficulty swallowing, or fever – please seek immediate medical attention. Here’s a referral to a dental specialist, should you change your mind. Have a good day, Mr. Schieber.
