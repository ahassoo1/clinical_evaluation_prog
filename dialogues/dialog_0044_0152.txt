DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Geho. Welcome to the clinic. It’s a pleasure to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, I got a letter… from the lab, I think? Saying my cholesterol is a little high. Hyper… something. That’s what the paper said. I don’t really understand it all, but it seemed like I should come get it checked out.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see that report here. Hyperlipidemia – that’s the high cholesterol. It’s very common, and good on you for getting it checked out proactively. It’s definitely something we want to address. To get a better picture of things, could you tell me a little more about your overall health?
PATIENT: Sure. Um… well, I’m 54, and I work as an aerospace engineer. So, I sit a lot. I guess that’s not good. I’m pretty tall – almost seven feet – and not very heavy for my height, maybe around 124 pounds. I’ve never had any big health problems, honestly. Just the usual colds now and then. I’m single, and I have Medicare. Does that all make sense?
DOCTOR: That’s all very helpful, thank you. Seven feet tall is quite a height! And being relatively slender for your height is good to know. No major health issues in the past is excellent. Medicare is straightforward. Just to clarify a few things, have you ever been told you have high blood pressure or diabetes?
PATIENT: No, never. No one has ever said anything about my blood pressure being high. And no diabetes, either. I don’t even have much of a sweet tooth, so I’d be surprised if I did. My mother… she had some problems with her knees when she got older, but that was just age, I think. And my father… he was a smoker, but he quit a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Okay, family history is good to know. So, no history of early heart disease or stroke on either side, just your mother’s knees and your father quitting smoking. Excellent. And just to round things out, are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, I don't take anything regularly. Not even a daily vitamin. I try to eat pretty healthy, lots of vegetables and fish. Though, I will admit, I don’t get as much exercise as I should. Work keeps me pretty busy.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear about the diet. It sounds like you're already taking some positive steps. Alright, Ms. Geho, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your overall condition. It'll just take a few minutes. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Sounds good. I trust your judgement, Doctor. Just let me know if anything feels… strange. I’m not really scared of needles, but I don’t love them either.
DOCTOR: Perfectly understandable. We'll take it slow, and I’ll explain everything as we go. Alright, let’s start with your blood pressure. Could you please take a seat and extend your arm?
PATIENT: Okay. It feels a little funny to be poked and prodded, but I guess that’s what doctors do!
DOCTOR: Okay, your blood pressure is 132/84. That's slightly elevated, but not drastically so. Now, let’s listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath in... and out... again... Good. Sounds clear. No murmurs or unusual sounds. Your heart rhythm is regular. Pulse is 72 and regular. Everything sounds good so far. Now, I’ll just take a quick listen to your abdomen.
PATIENT: Okay. My abdomen? Is that where you check for… I don’t know… everything? I always forget the names of things.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright. Your abdomen allows me to listen for any unusual sounds and check for tenderness, which can sometimes indicate other issues. Not tender to the touch. Sounds are normal. Everything seems good there as well. Based on what you’ve told me and this brief exam, the elevated cholesterol reading is the primary concern right now. To get a more complete picture, I’d like to order a full lipid panel, which will break down the different types of cholesterol, and a basic metabolic panel to check your kidney function and blood sugar. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds sensible. A full panel… that makes sense. I want to know what’s going on, so yes, please. When will I know the results? And will I need to come back for another visit?
DOCTOR: Excellent. The lab results usually take about 24-48 hours. The lab will send them directly to me, and my office will contact you to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them once they’re available. It's likely we'll need a follow-up visit, yes, to discuss the results and develop a plan if any adjustments are needed. In the meantime, focusing on a heart-healthy diet and incorporating regular exercise into your routine would be beneficial. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: Okay, 24-48 hours. Good. And heart-healthy diet and exercise… I can definitely try harder with that. Um… is there anything specific I should avoid eating? Like, is chocolate completely off-limits? I do enjoy a little chocolate sometimes.
DOCTOR: That’s a very good question! You don’t need to completely eliminate chocolate, but moderation is key. Dark chocolate, in particular, can actually have some health benefits. Focus on limiting saturated and trans fats, found in things like red meat, processed foods, and fried foods. Increasing your fiber intake through fruits, vegetables, and whole grains is also helpful. We can provide you with a handout detailing a heart-healthy diet at the front desk. Do you have any other questions or concerns before we wrap up for today?
PATIENT: Okay, so some chocolate is okay. That’s good to know! And I’ll ask for the handout. No, I think that’s everything for now. You’ve been very helpful, Doctor. I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Geho. I’m glad I could help. My office will be in touch within a couple of days to schedule your follow-up appointment. In the meantime, if you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath, or other concerning symptoms, please don’t hesitate to contact us immediately. Have a wonderful day, and I look forward to seeing you again soon.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too. I will. Bye bye!
