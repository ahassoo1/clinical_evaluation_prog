DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Chilla. I’m Dr. Fourney. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Yes, well, my husband, he suggested I come. He's been...concerned about things. He thinks I should have one of those documents prepared, just in case. An advance directive, I believe he called it. I must admit, I find the whole notion rather morbid, but he insists. Perhaps you could explain it to me, in plain language, of course.
DOCTOR: An advance directive… yes. Your husband is… proactive. It's not morbid, Ms. Chilla, it's… sensible. It’s simply a set of instructions outlining your wishes for medical care should you become unable to speak for yourself. A lot of people don't think about it, but it can prevent a great deal of stress and confusion for your family. Before we get into that specifically, though, let's talk about you. Are you currently experiencing any health problems?
PATIENT: Health problems? Well, nothing serious. I have my aches and pains, as one does at my age. A bit of arthritis in my hands, mostly. And I get winded easily climbing the stairs. But honestly, Doctor, I’ve always been quite robust. I don't believe in dwelling on ailments. It feels...undignified. This is more about what might happen, isn't it? I’m perfectly healthy now.
DOCTOR: Right. “Perfectly healthy now.” We’ll document that. It’s good you feel that way, Ms. Chilla. But even robust people have medical histories. Let's start with the basics. Have you been diagnosed with anything—even something minor—in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think. There was… a bout of bronchitis, years ago, when I was teaching abroad. A very unpleasant affair, it was. And… I had my tonsils out as a child, naturally. But beyond that, nothing of any significance, I assure you. I’ve always taken excellent care of myself. I eat a balanced diet, I get plenty of rest, and I avoid… undesirable influences. Really, Doctor, I am quite a picture of health. Is this really necessary? Perhaps my husband is overreacting.
DOCTOR: Your husband's concern is… noted. It’s good to hear you’ve had a relatively uneventful medical history. Alright. Any surgeries besides your tonsils?
PATIENT: No, no surgeries. Never. I find the whole idea rather… barbaric, frankly. Though my mother, she had a hysterectomy, years ago. A dreadful procedure, she said. But as for myself, I’ve managed to avoid the surgeon’s knife. I pride myself on that, actually. A healthy lifestyle, you see. One must be vigilant. Are we getting anywhere with this? I have a rather important engagement this afternoon, and I’d prefer not to be detained for too long.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Chilla. No surgeries. We're establishing that. Now, family history is important. Besides your mother’s hysterectomy, are there any significant illnesses that run in your family?
PATIENT: Significant illnesses… Hmm. My father, he had… high blood pressure, I believe. Towards the end of his life, naturally. And my aunt, on my mother's side, she had something with her heart, I think. A rather weak constitution, she always had. But beyond that… not particularly. We’re a long-lived family, generally. I believe good genes are just as important as a healthy lifestyle. It's a combination, really. Are you quite finished with these questions? I confess, I’m finding this line of inquiry rather… unsettling. It feels as though you’re preparing for the worst.
DOCTOR: I'm simply gathering information, Ms. Chilla. It’s my job. High blood pressure in your father, heart condition in your aunt… noted. And I assure you, I am not "preparing for the worst.” Let's talk about you again. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? No, none that I am aware of. I rarely take medication, Doctor. I believe in natural remedies whenever possible. A little honey and lemon for a cold, a warm bath for aches and pains. That sort of thing. I've always been quite sensitive, though. I react badly to strong perfumes and synthetic fabrics. But medications… no. Absolutely none. Though, now that I think of it, I had a rather unpleasant reaction to a flu shot, years ago. A slight fever and a general feeling of malaise. But it passed quickly. Is that what you mean?
DOCTOR: A reaction to the flu shot… documented. It’s good to know. Finally, are you currently taking any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, vitamins, supplements… anything?
PATIENT: Absolutely not. As I said, I rarely take medication. I find it… degrades one, somehow. And all those chemicals! No, Doctor. I rely on a balanced diet, plenty of rest, and a positive outlook. I take nothing. Honestly, I don't understand why you keep asking. I am a perfectly healthy woman, and this is all rather… tedious. I believe my husband is wasting both our time and your valuable resources. Is there any possibility we can move on to this “advance directive” now? I'd like to understand what he wants me to do before I agree to anything.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Chilla. No medications. Documented. While you describe yourself as healthy, it's important to have a complete picture. Let's move on to a brief physical exam, just to confirm your self-assessment. I need to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and just a general assessment. It won't take long. Then we can discuss your husband’s request. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: A physical exam? Really? Must we? I assure you, Doctor, I am perfectly capable of assessing my own physical state. However... if it will appease my husband, and expedite this process, I suppose I can endure a brief examination. But please be gentle. And keep it concise. I have a luncheon engagement, you understand. And do try not to touch me unnecessarily. I am a rather… private person.
DOCTOR: Very well. Please have a seat on the examination table. I will start with your blood pressure. Please extend your arm. 160 over 90… Interesting.
PATIENT: 160 over 90? Is that… high? My husband mentioned something about that. He’s always fussing over my blood pressure. I assure you, Doctor, it’s probably just nerves. This whole situation is rather… unnerving. Are you certain your equipment is functioning correctly? Perhaps it requires calibrating? I do wish he hadn't insisted on this. It’s making me quite agitated, which, I suspect, is exacerbating the problem. I'm usually much calmer than this.
DOCTOR: The equipment is functioning perfectly, Ms. Chilla. 160 over 90 is elevated, yes. It requires attention. Now, let's listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath… and exhale slowly. Lungs are clear, but I detect a slight murmur. Please take another deep breath… and exhale. It’s subtle, but it’s present. I'm noting this.
PATIENT: A murmur? Good heavens. Are you certain? My father never mentioned anything about a murmur. He was a doctor, you know. A very respected physician. He would have known, surely. And elevated blood pressure… this is all very disconcerting. You are making me quite anxious, Doctor. I feel faint. Perhaps I should have stayed home. This is precisely what I was afraid of. My husband will be insufferable. He always says I should see a doctor more often. "Preventative care," he calls it. It's a conspiracy, I tell you. A plot to fill the pockets of the medical establishment. Now, if you don't mind, I believe I've had quite enough of this examination. Are we finished? Can we please, please discuss this advance directive? I want to get this over with and go home.
DOCTOR: Ms. Chilla, I understand your anxiety. However, dismissing potential health concerns isn't beneficial. I detected a murmur and your blood pressure is elevated. These findings warrant further investigation. Before we discuss the advance directive, I strongly recommend a thorough workup—an EKG, a blood test, and a consultation with a cardiologist. This isn't about “filling pockets,” it’s about ensuring your well-being. Would you be willing to consider these tests?
PATIENT: A cardiologist? Tests? Doctor, are you suggesting I am… ill? This is outrageous! My husband will be delighted, I’m sure. He’s always been convinced I’m on the verge of collapse. But I assure you, I feel perfectly fine. A slight elevation in blood pressure, a barely perceptible murmur… these are hardly grounds for a battery of tests! I refuse. Absolutely refuse. I came here for an advance directive, not a medical interrogation. I want to understand what my husband wants me to sign, and then I want to leave. This entire experience has been thoroughly unpleasant. If you insist on pursuing these… unnecessary tests, I think I will seek a second opinion. Preferably from a doctor who takes my concerns seriously. Now, if you’ll excuse me…
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Chilla. I respect your decision, although I strongly advise against dismissing these findings. However, proceeding with the advance directive without addressing these health concerns is… unwise. It would be difficult for you to make informed decisions about your future care without a clearer picture of your current state. Before we discuss the paperwork, I need you to acknowledge that I’ve informed you of my concerns regarding your blood pressure and the heart murmur, and that you’ve declined further investigation. Do I have your consent to proceed with discussing the advance directive under these circumstances?
PATIENT: Oh, very well. Yes, yes, you've made your concerns abundantly clear. Document it, write it down, I don’t care. I acknowledge your… observations. And I acknowledge my refusal to be subjected to a needless battery of tests. Is that sufficient? I simply want to understand what this form entails, what my husband expects me to sign, and then I want to be done with this entire ordeal. Frankly, I find this whole process rather… demeaning. A perfectly healthy woman being grilled by a doctor… it’s simply absurd. Now, please, let’s get on with it. What exactly is an advance directive? And what are the implications of signing it? I haven't got all day.
DOCTOR: An advance directive, as I explained earlier, is a set of instructions outlining your wishes for medical care should you become unable to speak for yourself. It has two main parts: a living will and a durable power of attorney for healthcare. The living will specifies the types of medical treatments you would – or would not – want in certain situations, such as life-sustaining treatment, pain management, and resuscitation. The durable power of attorney for healthcare designates a person – your healthcare proxy – to make medical decisions on your behalf if you're unable to do so. This form allows you to specify your preferences and appoint a proxy. Do you understand?
PATIENT: A living will… and a proxy? So, it’s essentially pre-authorizing someone to decide my fate if I become… incapacitated? That sounds rather bleak, doesn't it? And you want me to specify what treatments I would or would not want? Doctor, I find that a deeply unsettling proposition. Who knows what circumstances I might face? It's impossible to anticipate every eventuality. And to assign someone the power to make life-or-death decisions… I’m not sure I’m comfortable with any of this. This is all rather… final. What if I change my mind later? Can I revoke it? And who would I even choose for a proxy? My husband, I suppose, but… he can be rather overbearing. Is there no simpler way to handle this?
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Chilla, you can revoke the advance directive at any time, as long as you are mentally competent. It simply requires a written statement and notification to your healthcare providers. As for choosing a proxy, it should be someone you trust implicitly to honor your wishes, even if they disagree with them personally. It doesn't have to be your husband, but it often is. It should be someone who knows your values and would advocate for your best interests. This section allows you to specify your preferences regarding life-sustaining treatment, such as mechanical ventilation, artificial nutrition, and hydration. You can be as specific or as general as you like. Do you have any specific concerns about any of these treatments?
PATIENT: Mechanical ventilation… artificial nutrition… Doctor, are you suggesting I’m likely to end up hooked up to machines? This is becoming increasingly morbid. I’ve never given any thought to these… technicalities. Frankly, the prospect of being kept alive artificially, in a vegetative state, is rather horrifying. But then again, to deny me life-sustaining treatment if there’s even a glimmer of hope… This is a terrible dilemma. Perhaps my husband should be the one filling out this form. He’s always been so meticulous about these things. He’d know exactly what to specify. It’s all rather… overwhelming. I suppose if I had to choose, I wouldn’t want to be kept alive indefinitely on machines. But then again, what if I’m just temporarily incapacitated? What if I could recover? This is impossible! I can’t possibly make these decisions now. It’s too much. I need time to think. A lot of time.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Chilla. This is a difficult process, and it's perfectly acceptable to take your time. You are not obligated to make any decisions today. However, it’s important to remember that if you become incapacitated without an advance directive, your healthcare proxy will be determined by state law, and it may not be your husband. Given your current state of mind, I recommend you take this document home, discuss it with your husband, and consider consulting with an attorney specializing in estate planning. We can revisit this at your convenience. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I believe that is all. Thank you… for trying, at least. This has been… a trying experience, to say the least. I shall take this document home and… deliberate. And perhaps consult with an attorney, as you suggested. Though I must warn you, my husband is likely to have very strong opinions on the matter. I suppose it’s best to have all one’s affairs in order, even if one doesn’t particularly want to contemplate such things. Thank you again, Doctor. And good day. .
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Chilla. If you have any questions or concerns, please don’t hesitate to contact the office. Have a good day. .
