DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Bartok. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Abady. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, to get started, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Pleasure is… all mine, I suppose. I'm here for… a check-up. For the… team. Yes, the team. A sports team. I need to be sure I’m… alright for tryouts. It's important. Though, honestly, I don’t remember all the details. My ex-wife handled most of that paperwork.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Bartok. A pre-participation physical for your sports team. That’s perfectly reasonable. It's good you're being proactive. And don't worry about the paperwork details; we can sort through everything. To start, could you tell me a bit more about the team?
PATIENT: Team? Oh. It’s… a baseball team. A local team. Not… professional, you understand. More… for fun. Though, we do try hard. I play… I play first base, I think. Or maybe it was second. It’s been a while. A long while. My son… he used to remind me. He knows these things.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Mr. Bartok. A local baseball team – excellent. First or second base, either one is quite active. No need to worry about the specifics at the moment. To help me get a better understanding of your overall health, could you tell me about any medical conditions you’ve been diagnosed with in the past?
PATIENT: Medical… conditions? Hmm. Let me see. I had… something with my knee, years ago. A bad twist. Needed… physical therapy. A lot of it. And… I think the doctor said something about my blood pressure. Being… high. But it wasn’t anything serious, I don’t think. Mostly just needed to… watch what I eat. My wife… she was always on me about that. Always. Really. Is that what you need to know?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s helpful, Mr. Bartok. The knee injury and the history of elevated blood pressure are both important. Do you recall when you were diagnosed with the high blood pressure, and if you were ever prescribed any medication for it?
PATIENT: Medication? Oh… I think she gave me a little… pill. A white one. Every morning. But I stopped taking it. It made me… sleepy. And I didn’t like feeling sleepy. She got… upset about that. A lot of upset. Honestly, I don’t remember the year. It was… after the divorce, I believe. Yes, definitely after. She handled all that, you see. All the appointments, the pills, everything. It was all… a blur.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Bartok. It sounds like things were quite stressful then. Discontinuing medication can sometimes have consequences, and it’s good we’re discussing this now. Just to be thorough, have you ever been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Hospitalized… hmm. Let me think… No. No, I don’t believe so. Not… for anything serious. I broke my arm once, when I was a boy. Fell out of a tree. But that wasn't… a hospital stay, really. Just a cast. A big, plaster cast. A few weeks. Nothing like… being sick. I've always been… pretty healthy, you know? Considering. My mother always said I had strong bones. Though, that was a long time ago. Really long.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Mr. Bartok. No significant hospitalizations. Now, have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Surgeries… Oh, yes. My tonsils. When I was little. A very long time ago. It was… common then, I think. All the children had their tonsils out. It hurt a lot, afterwards. Ice cream helped. A lot of ice cream. And… I think that was it. No… nothing else. Certainly nothing recent. My wife… she would have told me if I’d had any surgeries, wouldn’t she? She kept track of everything. Really, everything.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's helpful. Childhood tonsillectomy. Now, can you tell me about any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family… hmm. My father… he had… something with his heart, I think. A weak heart. He didn’t take care of himself. Smoked too much, drank too much. He died… young. And my mother… she had… arthritis, I think. Bad arthritis in her hands. Couldn’t do much with them, towards the end. Very painful. And… that’s about it, I suppose. Everyone on my mother's side seemed to live a long time. Very long. Though, they were all… thin. Very thin.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Bartok. That’s helpful information. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… No, no, not really. I don’t think so. I mean, I don’t like shellfish. But that’s a… preference, not an allergy. Makes me… sick to my stomach, but that’s just the taste. My ex-wife… she always asked me that, about allergies. Always very careful. She wouldn’t let me eat anything without checking first. It was… irritating, sometimes. Really irritating. But she meant well, I suppose. Is that what you need to know?
DOCTOR: No, that's perfectly clear, Mr. Bartok. No known allergies. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No. No, I’m not taking anything. Not anymore. Stopped everything after… well, after she left. Didn’t see the point, really. All those pills… just made me feel… worse. I don’t bother with vitamins either. Waste of money, if you ask me. I used to take… something for my joints, I think. When I was playing more baseball. But that was a long time ago. Really long. It didn’t seem to help much anyway. Honestly, I prefer a good cup of coffee in the morning. That’s all I need.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Bartok. No current medications. Now, before we proceed with a physical exam, could you tell me a little bit about your social history?
PATIENT: Social… history? What does that even mean? You mean… do I have friends? Yes. A few. We… we play dominoes sometimes. And… drink coffee. Mostly just talk. Nothing exciting. I’m… divorced, as you know. No children at home anymore. They’re… grown. Have their own lives. I live… alone. Quiet life. Prefer it that way, really. No… troubles. No complications. Is that enough? What are you trying to find out?
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Bartok. I just need a general understanding of your lifestyle. So, you live alone, enjoy dominoes with friends, and have grown children. Do you currently smoke or use any tobacco products?
PATIENT: Smoke? No. Never smoked in my life. My father smoked, of course. Terrible habit. Always coughing. Smelled awful. I always told him he should quit. But he never listened. Stubborn man. I… I wouldn’t touch a cigarette. Makes me… sick, just thinking about it. No, not a smoker. Definitely not. Never have been. Clean living, mostly. Considering everything. Though, I do enjoy a… beer sometimes. With my friends. A couple of beers. That’s all. Is that… bad?
DOCTOR: No, that's not bad at all, Mr. Bartok. Occasional beer consumption is fine. Now, do you drink alcohol regularly?
PATIENT: Regularly? Hmm. Not every day. Maybe… once or twice a week. When I meet with my friends. We go to… a little bar down the street. It's… a quiet place. Mostly just talk. Nothing wild. A couple of beers, maybe. That’s all. I don’t drink… to excess. Never have. I… I used to drink more with my wife. But she… she didn’t like that. Always nagging. So I cut back. Prefer a quiet evening at home now. Is that… acceptable? What are you looking for? You’re making me nervous, you know.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Mr. Bartok. It's good you’re mindful of your alcohol consumption. Occasional social drinking is fine. Now, before we move on to the physical exam, could you describe your typical level of physical activity?
PATIENT: Physical activity… Well, I used to be very active. Playing baseball, you know? Lots of running, throwing. But… that was a long time ago. Now… I walk. A little bit. To the store, maybe. And… I help my neighbor sometimes. With his yard work. But that’s about it. Nothing strenuous. I get… tired easily these days. Old age, I suppose. Honestly, it’s not what it used to be. I mostly just sit. And… watch television. Is that… bad? I'm not an athlete anymore, Doctor. You're making me think about all the things I can't do.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Mr. Bartok. It's good you’re still walking and helping your neighbor. Now, I’d like to perform a brief physical exam. Is that agreeable to you?
PATIENT: Physical exam… Oh. Yes, alright. I suppose so. Though I don’t expect it to be… good. I haven’t been to a doctor in… well, a long time. Everything’s probably falling apart. But alright. Do what you need to do. Just… be gentle, okay? And please, don’t tell me anything I don’t want to hear. Is that… alright? What exactly will you be doing? I don’t like surprises, Doctor. Really, I don’t.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Bartok. I will be as gentle as possible. We will start with your vital signs – your blood pressure, pulse, temperature, and respiratory rate. Then I'll listen to your heart and lungs, and examine your abdomen. I’ll also take a look at your reflexes and check your range of motion. I will explain everything as I go, and if anything feels uncomfortable, please let me know immediately. We can stop at any time. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Vital signs… heart and lungs… Oh, alright. Sounds… thorough. I suppose it’s better to know. Though I don’t want to hear bad news. No, not at all. Just… be quick about it, okay? And explain everything. I don't like being kept in the dark. And... please don't poke me too much. I'm not a fan of poking. Is that… too much to ask? Just… be careful, Doctor. That's all. And… what if you find something wrong? What will you do then?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Bartok. I will be as careful as possible and explain each step as we go. If I find anything concerning, I will discuss it with you in detail and we can decide together on the best course of action, which may involve further testing or a referral to a specialist. We’ll take it one step at a time. Let's start with your blood pressure. Could you please sit back and relax your arm for me?
PATIENT: Alright. Relax. Easier said than done, you know. My blood pressure is probably sky high. My ex-wife always told me it was. She was always worrying about my blood pressure. A terrible worrier, that woman. Just… do it quickly, okay? And try not to squeeze too hard. It hurts, you know. My arm is sensitive. Just… get it over with.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Bartok. Just breathe normally. In and out… That’s good. Your blood pressure is 152/88. Your pulse is 72 and regular. Temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit. Your respiratory rate is 16 breaths per minute. Your vital signs are slightly elevated, Mr. Bartok, but not immediately concerning. We’ll keep an eye on them. Now, I’d like to listen to your heart and lungs. Could you please take a deep breath for me?
PATIENT: Elevated, you say? Just as I suspected. My ex-wife would have a fit if she heard that. Always going on about my heart. She was convinced I was going to have a stroke. Just… get it over with. I don’t like doctors. Never have. Too much poking and prodding. Are you… hearing anything bad? Please be honest. I can take it. I think.
DOCTOR: I’m hearing normal heart sounds, Mr. Bartok. There are no murmurs or abnormal rhythms. Your lungs are clear, with normal breath sounds. No wheezing or crackles detected. Everything sounds good so far, Mr. Bartok. Now, I'd like to examine your abdomen. Could you please lie back on the examination table?
PATIENT: Good. No murmurs, you say? That’s… something, I suppose. My ex-wife always worried about murmurs. She said they meant something terrible was wrong. Abdomen, you say? More poking, I presume? I’m not a fan of having my stomach poked, Doctor. It’s… sensitive. And please, be gentle. I had… stomach trouble once. A very bad experience. Just… hurry it along, okay? This is… unpleasant. Really unpleasant.
DOCTOR: I’m just checking for any tenderness or masses, Mr. Bartok. It’s a routine part of the examination. Just breathe normally. Everything feels soft and non-tender, Mr. Bartok. No masses detected. Now, I’d like to check your reflexes. Could you please bend your knees and let your legs dangle freely?
PATIENT: No tenderness… good. That’s… good. My ex-wife always said I had a sensitive stomach. She was right, as usual. Reflexes, you say? More poking, I presume? My legs are… not what they used to be. Old age, you know. Just… be careful, okay? I don’t want to fall. And please, don’t hit me with that little hammer. I’ve seen doctors do that. It looks… painful.
DOCTOR: Just a quick tap, Mr. Bartok. Good reflexes. Two plus bilaterally. And good reflexes in your ankles as well. Two plus bilaterally. Now, I'd like to check your range of motion. Can you please try to touch your toes for me?
PATIENT: Two plus… whatever that means. Good reflexes, you say? That's… something. My ex-wife always said I was a quick thinker. Maybe that's what it means. Ooh… that’s… difficult. My back is… not what it used to be. Old age, you know. Is that… good enough? I can’t bend that much anymore. It hurts, you know. Really hurts. Just… get it over with, okay? This is… torture.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Bartok. You have some limited range of motion, but nothing concerning at this time. We'll keep that in mind. Alright, Mr. Bartok, that completes the physical exam. Based on what I’ve found, your vital signs are slightly elevated and you have some limited range of motion, but overall, your physical exam is within normal limits. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Within normal limits, you say? Despite everything? I’m surprised, honestly. My ex-wife always said I was a ticking time bomb. Questions… Hmm. Will I… will I die soon? Is that a silly question? She used to worry about everything. And… will I be able to play baseball? That’s… important to me, you know. It’s the only thing I have left. Will my blood pressure… kill me on the field? Honestly, Doctor, I’m a nervous wreck. Please, tell me… will I be alright?
DOCTOR: Those are perfectly valid questions, Mr. Bartok. It’s understandable to be anxious, especially with a history of worry from your ex-wife. Based on today’s exam, I don’t believe you are in any immediate danger. Your vital signs are slightly elevated, but manageable with lifestyle changes – we can discuss diet and exercise. As for playing baseball, it's important to proceed with caution. We'll need to monitor your blood pressure closely. I recommend a cardiac stress test to evaluate your heart function during exercise. It will give us a better understanding of your fitness level and whether or not it's safe for you to return to the field. We’ll take things one step at a time, Mr. Bartok. We’ll get your blood pressure under control, evaluate your heart health, and then we can make a decision together about returning to baseball. Does that sound acceptable to you?
PATIENT: A stress test… more poking and prodding, I presume? Honestly, Doctor, I’m not a fan of tests. But… alright. If it will tell me if I can play baseball… then I suppose I have no choice. Lifestyle changes… what does that even mean? Do I have to give up coffee? She always nagged me about coffee. And exercise… I’m an old man, Doctor. I can’t run around like a… a young person. Alright. I suppose. One step at a time, you say? That’s… acceptable. But please, no surprises. And no coffee deprivation. Is that… too much to ask? Just… be honest with me, Doctor. That’s all I ask. Honestly, I just want to play baseball. Is that so much to ask?
DOCTOR: No, Mr. Bartok, that is not too much to ask at all. And I understand your concerns. Let's talk about the stress test first. It involves walking on a treadmill while we monitor your heart rate, blood pressure, and EKG. It’s a safe and painless procedure, and we can stop at any time if you feel uncomfortable. As for lifestyle changes, we’ll start small. Gradual exercise, like walking 30 minutes a day, can make a big difference. And regarding coffee, we don’t need to eliminate it completely, but moderation is key. Perhaps limit yourself to one cup a day. We can discuss a healthy diet as well, focusing on fruits, vegetables, and lean protein. We’ll work together to create a plan that is manageable and sustainable for you, Mr. Bartok. And I promise to be honest with you every step of the way. I’ll order the cardiac stress test now. The scheduling department will contact you to arrange an appointment. After the test, we’ll review the results together and decide on the best course of action. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: One cup… one cup of coffee. I can manage that. She would have a fit if she heard that. A scheduling department… more people poking around? Honestly, I just want to get this over with. Alright. I suppose. One step at a time, you say? That’s… acceptable. But please, no surprises. And please, tell them to be gentle. And… what if the test shows something bad? What if I can’t play baseball? Honestly, Doctor, that would be… devastating. Just… be honest with me, okay? That’s all I ask. Honestly, I just want to play baseball. Is that so much to ask?
DOCTOR: It’s understandable to be anxious about the test results, Mr. Bartok. I promise to be honest with you, no matter what. If the test shows something concerning, we’ll discuss all your options, which may include medication, further testing, or cardiac rehabilitation. We will work together to create a plan that is best for your overall health. And even if you can’t return to baseball immediately, there are other ways to stay active and healthy. Remember, we’ll take things one step at a time. We will monitor your health closely and make adjustments as needed. I’ll provide you with a written summary of today’s exam and the order for the cardiac stress test. The scheduling department will contact you within the next few days to arrange an appointment. I’m confident that we can work together to achieve your goals, Mr. Bartok. And please, don’t hesitate to call my office if you have any questions or concerns. It was a pleasure meeting you today, Mr. Bartok. .
