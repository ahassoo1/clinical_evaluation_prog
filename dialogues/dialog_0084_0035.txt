DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Sucich. I’m Dr. Voytek. Welcome to the clinic. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Oh, please, call me Mirriam. It’s the hiccups, really. Been going on for… well, a good few days now, and they just won’t stop. It’s quite annoying, actually! Not painful, just… persistent.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mirriam. Persistent hiccups, got it. A few days, you said?
PATIENT: Yes, started Tuesday, I think. Maybe Wednesday. It’s hard to keep track when they keep interrupting! I was hoping they’d just go away on their own, you know? Like they usually do. But no luck so far.
DOCTOR: Right, understandable. And have you noticed anything that seems to trigger them, or make them worse?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. Not really, not that I can tell. I’ve been trying to think about it. I had a big glass of lemonade on Tuesday, but I drink lemonade all the time and it’s never bothered me before. Ate my usual food, nothing fancy. Maybe… when I get excited? But that doesn’t seem to be a consistent thing either. I was telling my granddaughter a story yesterday and they flared up, but then again, they just happen sometimes when I’m sitting quietly. It’s very random.
DOCTOR: Okay, random hiccups with no clear trigger. And besides the annoyance, are you experiencing anything else?
PATIENT: No, no. Nothing else at all. No heartburn, no trouble breathing, no pain anywhere. Just… hiccups. It’s just tiring, honestly. Especially at night, they keep me awake. You know, when you're my age, a good night's sleep is precious.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mirriam. Sleep is important. Let’s take a look at your medical history. I see you’ve been a patient here for some time. I see some records of… well, usual age-related things, nothing that immediately jumps out as related to the hiccups. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. I used to take something for my arthritis, years ago, but I stopped a long time now. It didn’t really help much, to be honest, and the doctor said it wasn’t good to stay on it forever. Oh, and I had a bit of a scare with my heart a few years back, but they put a little… a little thing in, and it's been fine ever since. A pacemaker, that's what it is.
DOCTOR: Okay, a pacemaker – good to know. And you said you stopped the arthritis medication years ago. Do you currently take any medications at all, even over-the-counter things like vitamins or pain relievers?
PATIENT: Just a multivitamin, every morning. And sometimes, if my knees are really acting up, I’ll take a little bit of paracetamol. Just a couple, you know, when I really need it. Not every day, just when I’ve been gardening or something. Nothing else, I promise. I’m usually pretty good about not taking too many pills.
DOCTOR: Okay, multivitamin and occasional paracetamol. Good to know. Let’s do a quick physical exam, just to rule out anything obvious. Can you lie down on the exam table for me?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. No problem at all. Just let me know if you need me to do anything special. I'm not as nimble as I used to be, you know!
DOCTOR: Alright, just relax. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs first. Heart sounds are regular, pacemaker functioning normally. Lungs are clear. Abdomen is soft, no tenderness. Reflexes are a little slow, but that's not unexpected. Everything sounds and feels normal so far. I don't think there's anything immediately concerning. Now, I'm going to try a few things that sometimes stop hiccups. It's a bit silly, but it's worth a try. Would you mind holding your breath for as long as you comfortably can?
PATIENT: Not at all, Doctor. I've held my breath a few times trying to get rid of these things myself! Go right ahead. I'll do my best. Though, I’m not known for my lung capacity! Just let me know if you want me to stop, alright? Don't want to faint on you!
DOCTOR: Okay, take a deep breath… and hold it… good… good… how are you feeling?
PATIENT: Oh dear… that didn’t do it. Actually, it made them worse! Hic! See? A whole bunch! Maybe that wasn’t such a good idea.
DOCTOR: You're right, that didn’t help. Sorry about that. Alright, let’s try something else. Sometimes drinking a glass of water quickly can help. We can also try stimulating the vagus nerve… I can gently push on the back of your throat, but it can sometimes cause a gag reflex. Would you be okay with that?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. A gag reflex? That doesn't sound very pleasant! Maybe the water first? I can manage a glass of water. I'm not sure I'm brave enough for the throat pushing. Hic! Though, honestly, anything is worth a try at this point.
DOCTOR: Alright, try drinking it quickly, without taking a breath. How did that go?
PATIENT: Hic! Nope. No luck. Maybe I just have stubborn hiccups. It feels like they’re mocking me now!
DOCTOR: Okay, we've tried a few things and they're not responding. It's possible these are just going to resolve on their own, but since they've been going on for a few days, and are bothering you, let's consider a few other possibilities. It's unlikely to be anything serious, but we should rule out anything that could be causing them. I'm thinking a chest x-ray might be helpful, just to make sure everything looks clear. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: A chest x-ray… hmm. Well, if you think it’s best, Doctor. I suppose it can't hurt. I've had a few x-rays in my life, nothing to be scared of, right? Hic! As long as it's quick, and doesn't involve too much bending. My knees aren’t what they used to be, you know!
DOCTOR: No, it's a very quick procedure, and we can take it easy with the positioning. We'll make sure you're comfortable. I'll write the order for the x-ray now. It’ll be done right here at the clinic. Then, once we have the results, we can discuss them and decide on the next steps. In the meantime, try to stay hydrated and rest. And don't worry too much. It’s probably just a stubborn case of hiccups. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so, Doctor. You've explained everything very clearly. I appreciate you taking the time to try a few things, even if they didn’t work. Hic! I'll just try to relax, and hopefully these will disappear soon. Thank you.
DOCTOR: Alright, good. A nurse will be in shortly to take you for the x-ray. And please, don’t hesitate to let us know if anything changes or if the hiccups get worse. Here’s a note summarizing everything we discussed, and the order for the x-ray.
PATIENT: Thank you so much, Doctor Voytek. I really appreciate it. Hic! I will. Bye bye to you too.
