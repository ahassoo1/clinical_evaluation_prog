DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Mayhaugh. I’m Dr. Trestrail. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. It's...well, it's my ears, mostly. They've been acting up. And, um...my daughter, Lani, she said I really should come. She worries. I… I forget exactly what happens, but it's like... everything spins, and I can't hear properly for a bit. It comes and goes.
DOCTOR: “Spins,” you say. And you’re experiencing hearing difficulty during these episodes?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. The spinning…it's awful. Makes me feel quite sick, actually. And then everything sounds muffled, like there’s cotton in my ears. It doesn’t last long, thankfully, but it's frightening when it happens. I… my husband, bless him, he used to get something similar. But that was years ago.
DOCTOR: Alright. And how long has this been going on, Ms. Mayhaugh?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That's a tricky one. A long time, I think. On and off. Maybe… a year? Or more? It's hard to say, honestly. It doesn't happen every day, not by a long shot. But enough to be… unsettling. Lani keeps saying it’s getting worse, but my memory… it’s not what it used to be.
DOCTOR: A year or more, intermittently. And has anything specific triggered these episodes, as far as you can recall?
PATIENT: Specific…? Hmm. Not that I’ve noticed. I… I don't think so. Sometimes it happens when I’m just…sitting. Other times, maybe when I’m busy? I work, you know… at the games place. But it doesn't seem to be linked to that. It just… happens. Oh! Wait... maybe when I'm tired? I’m often quite tired, these days.
DOCTOR: “The games place”?
PATIENT: Oh! Yes, the… the arcade, down on Main Street. I help with the prizes, and the tickets, and… well, everything, really. It’s not very glamorous, but it keeps me busy. It's a gambling place, I suppose. Lots of machines. Not that I gamble much.
DOCTOR: Right. And you mentioned fatigue. Can you describe that a little more?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s just… tired, Doctor. Like, bone-deep tired. Even after a full night’s sleep, I wake up feeling… drained. It’s hard to explain. It’s not like I’m doing anything strenuous, you know? Just… existing feels exhausting these days. And then, like I said, my memory… It's just not what it used to be, and that makes me tired too, always worrying I've forgotten something important.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's move on to some other questions. Have you experienced any dizziness other than these spinning episodes?
PATIENT: Oh... dizziness... well, sometimes I feel a little unsteady on my feet. Not all the time, mind you. Just… a little wobbly, like I might fall. It’s not a big deal, usually. I just hold onto something. But it does happen sometimes, even when I’m not having the spinning.
DOCTOR: And have you noticed any ringing in your ears, Ms. Mayhaugh?
PATIENT: Ringing…? Hmm. Now that you mention it… maybe. It’s not constant, and it’s not very loud. Just a… faint buzzing, sometimes. I usually don’t pay much attention to it. It’s probably just the noise from the games place, you know? Everything is always beeping and whirring. It's hard to tell what's real and what's just in my head, these days.
DOCTOR: Alright. Before we proceed with a physical exam, let’s review your medical history. Do you have any known allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies…? No, not that I know of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything, not that I can recall. My husband always took care of the medicine, bless him. He remembered everything. I… I just took what he gave me.
DOCTOR: And what medications are you currently taking, Ms. Mayhaugh?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That’s… tricky. Let me think. Well, I take something for my blood pressure, I believe. A little white pill. And… something for my arthritis, in my hands. It makes them a bit stiff, you know. And… oh, and I think my daughter brings me something for my sleep. It helps me drift off, but I don’t remember the name. Everything gets so mixed up! I really wish I kept a better list.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’m going to need you to try and recall as accurately as possible. Do you have any idea of the dosages for any of these medications?
PATIENT: Oh dear, no. I really don’t. It's all just… a blur. Lani handles all that. She fills the prescriptions and puts them in those little containers. I just… take them. I'm so sorry. I’m not very good with these things, you see. It’s just been… a lot since my husband passed.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, we'll have to rely on your daughter's assistance to clarify that information. Now, have you had any previous surgeries or hospitalizations?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think... I had my gallbladder removed years ago. A very long time ago. And... I was in the hospital once when I broke my wrist, falling in the garden. But that was ages and ages ago, when Lani was just a little girl. Nothing serious, mind you. Just a break. I don't think there's been anything else.
DOCTOR: And what about your family history?
PATIENT: Oh. Family history… my mother, bless her, she had… problems with her balance, I think. She used to get dizzy a lot, like me. And my brother… he had trouble hearing, towards the end. And my father… he had a bad heart. Yes, a very bad heart. But that was a long time ago. It's all a bit blurry, you see?
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's move on to some physical examination. I'm going to need to check your ears, nose and throat, your blood pressure and pulse, listen to your heart and lungs, and also assess your balance and coordination. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Oh. Yes, yes, that’s fine. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. I just… I hope it doesn’t take too long. I have to get home and… well, Lani wants me to sort out some papers. And I promised to make her a cup of tea.
DOCTOR: Very well. Please sit forward. I’ll start with your ears. “Cerumen present bilaterally… slight erythema of the tympanic membranes…”
PATIENT: Oh, that’s… a little cold. Is it… is it normal to feel a breeze?
DOCTOR: It’s the air from the instrument, Ms. Mayhaugh. Now, open your mouth and say “ah.” I need to examine your throat. “Mild pharyngeal erythema… no obvious exudates.”
PATIENT: It feels a little strange, Doctor. Everything is so… bright. I think I have a bit of a tickle in my throat, actually.
DOCTOR: Lymph nodes are slightly palpable, non-tender. Now, please take a deep breath. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs. “Heart sounds regular rate and rhythm… slight crackles in the lower lobes bilaterally.”
PATIENT: That’s… cold again. And it feels a bit… tight. Like someone is squeezing my chest.
DOCTOR: Now, please stand up. I need to assess your balance and coordination. I’ll ask you to stand with your feet together and close your eyes.
PATIENT: Oh… oh dear. I… I don't feel very steady. It’s… it’s spinning a little bit again.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. Sit down, Ms. Mayhaugh. That is enough for now. We have sufficient information for a preliminary assessment.
PATIENT: Oh… thank you, Doctor. I… I don’t like feeling like this. It’s all a bit much. What did you find? Is it something serious?
DOCTOR: Based on my examination and your reported symptoms, Ms. Mayhaugh, you are exhibiting signs consistent with… a number of possibilities. We need to rule out several things. Your slight crackles could indicate some underlying respiratory issue, and the dizziness and balance issues… those are concerning. Given your age, and the intermittent nature of these symptoms, we need to consider everything from benign positional vertigo to… other, more serious neurological causes.
PATIENT: Neurological causes…? Oh dear. What does that mean? Is it… is it something bad? My daughter, Lani, she worries so much about my health. I don't want to scare her.
DOCTOR: “Neurological causes” simply means issues relating to your brain and nerves, Ms. Mayhaugh. It’s a broad term. We need to determine the source of your dizziness. It could be something relatively minor, or… something more significant. But we won’t know until we conduct some further testing. I’m going to order a complete blood count, a metabolic panel to assess your overall health, and an audiogram to evaluate your hearing. And I want you to have a CT scan of your head to rule out any structural abnormalities.
PATIENT: A… a CT scan? Oh dear. Is that… is that safe? And… what if it shows something bad? I don't want to be poked and prodded and… and have things found that are… unpleasant.
DOCTOR: Ms. Mayhaugh, a CT scan is a standard diagnostic procedure. It uses X-rays to create images of your brain, allowing us to identify any potential problems. The risk of complications is minimal. It’s far more concerning to not investigate these symptoms, and allow a potential serious condition to go undiagnosed. I’m also going to prescribe you a course of meclizine to help manage the dizziness in the meantime. And I want you to schedule an appointment with an audiologist as soon as possible. I’ll provide you with a referral. And, Ms. Mayhaugh, it’s essential that you inform your daughter, Lani, of these findings and the necessary testing. It’s important to have a support system during this process. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Oh… so many things. The scan… will it hurt? And… what if something is found? What if it’s… bad? I don't think I can… I don't know if I can cope with that. My husband… he always handled these things. I feel so lost without him. And Lani… she’s already worried sick. I don't want to frighten her even more. Is there… is there anything else I can do?
DOCTOR: Ms. Mayhaugh, it’s understandable that you’re feeling anxious. However, it’s important to remain calm and focus on getting the necessary testing done. The CT scan will involve lying still for a brief period. It’s not painful, but it may be slightly uncomfortable. As for what the scan might reveal… it’s impossible to say at this stage. We need to gather more information before we can draw any conclusions. And regarding your daughter, Lani… it’s important to be honest with her. Hiding information will only exacerbate her anxiety. Explain to her that we’re taking proactive steps to determine the cause of your symptoms. Here is the referral to the audiologist. Schedule an appointment as soon as possible. And, Ms. Mayhaugh, if your symptoms worsen significantly, or you experience any new neurological symptoms, such as weakness, numbness, or difficulty speaking, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes… yes, I understand. Emergency room… weakness… numbness… It all sounds so… frightening. I just want to feel normal again. I miss my husband so much. He always knew what to do. Doctor… is there anything… anything at all… to make me feel a little bit better right now? Just something to calm my nerves? I feel like I’m going to… faint.
DOCTOR: Very well. I’m going to prescribe you a short course of lorazepam, a mild anti-anxiety medication, to help manage your symptoms in the meantime. Take it as directed. However, please be aware that it can cause drowsiness. Do not operate heavy machinery or drive while taking this medication. And, Ms. Mayhaugh, it’s essential that you understand this is a temporary solution. The underlying cause of your symptoms needs to be addressed. Focus on scheduling the necessary testing and following up with the audiologist. Do you have any further questions?
PATIENT: No… no, I think that’s all. Thank you, Doctor. …I hope… I hope everything will be alright. .
DOCTOR: Right. Good day, Ms. Mayhaugh. .
