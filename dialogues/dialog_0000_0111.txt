DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Drahota. I’m Dr. Batara. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. Honestly, I haven't the faintest idea why I’m here. My wife insisted, you see. Something about my… complexion. She says it’s gotten “dark.” I feel rather tired, admittedly, but I've always been a busy man. Reinforcing iron doesn't leave much time for… leisure. Is this going to take long?
DOCTOR: “Reinforcing iron?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Rebar work. Building. Structures. It’s… physically demanding. Though, I suppose at my age, everything is physically demanding. Are we getting anywhere with this, or shall I be returning to my wife's endless list of errands?
DOCTOR: Right. So, rebar work. And your wife noticed a change in your skin tone… along with your fatigue. I see here you haven’t had a full check-up in… quite some time. Well, let's start with the fatigue. When did you start noticing you were feeling more tired than usual?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, “when” is a rather imprecise question. Time… slips away, you understand. Perhaps… a few months? It's difficult to pinpoint. I’ve always worked hard. Always. Perhaps I’m simply… experiencing the natural consequences of a life well-spent. Is this relevant to the… discoloration? I’d prefer to get this sorted quickly.
DOCTOR: It could be relevant. Fatigue can be a symptom of many things. Let's try to be a bit more specific. Has the fatigue been getting progressively worse, or has it been fairly constant for these few months?
PATIENT: Constant, I suppose. Though, there are good days and bad days, naturally. One doesn’t simply stop working because one feels a bit… sluggish. It’s… impractical. Look, Doctor, I assure you I am perfectly capable. I simply require a quick assessment to appease my wife and then I can return to more pressing matters. Is there anything specific you are looking for? Perhaps a simple blood test will suffice?
DOCTOR: A blood test is a good start. But before that, let’s just do a quick physical exam. I need to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your skin. It won't take long. And it is important, Mr. Drahota, even if you feel perfectly capable. We need to rule out anything serious. Now, if you’ll just sit back and relax…
PATIENT: “Relax?” Doctor, I haven't truly relaxed in decades. Very well. But I must warn you, I’ve never been particularly fond of doctors poking and prodding. And do be quick about it. I have appointments, you know.
DOCTOR: Of course. We'll be as efficient as possible. First, let's listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath in… and out. Heart sounds are… somewhat diminished. Lungs are clear, but breathing is a little shallow. Blood pressure is 130/80. Not terrible, but a bit elevated. Now, let’s take a look at your skin. I do notice some… discoloration. A yellowish tinge, particularly on your palms. And your skin feels slightly cool to the touch.
PATIENT: Yellowish? I spend my days handling iron, Doctor. Perhaps it’s simply…rust. As for feeling cool, it is air-conditioned in here. Honestly, I fail to see what any of this accomplishes. Are you going to suggest bed rest? Because that is simply out of the question. Let's just get to the blood test, shall we? This is all rather… unnecessary.
DOCTOR: While rust is a possibility, the discoloration is more widespread than I'd expect from handling iron alone. And you also mentioned fatigue. We need to rule out other causes. Now, I'm going to order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a thyroid panel. These will give us a better understanding of what's going on. While we wait for the results, can you tell me a bit about your diet?
PATIENT: My diet? Doctor, I eat to live, not live to eat. Mostly rice, vegetables, perhaps some fish when my wife manages to procure it. Nothing particularly… noteworthy. I assure you, I don’t spend my evenings indulging in delicacies. It’s a practical existence, Doctor. And frankly, I find this line of questioning rather intrusive. Are you attempting to ascertain whether I’ve been neglecting my health? Because I assure you, my health is perfectly adequate for a man of my age and profession. Now, when can I expect these… results? I have commitments, you know.
DOCTOR: The lab usually takes about two to three business days to get the results back to us. I'll have my nurse contact you as soon as they're available. In the meantime, I'm going to order a liver function test as well, just to be on the safe side. While we're waiting for these tests to come back, are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Doctor, I am eighty-five years old! What do you expect? Aches, pains, the occasional… forgetfulness. Nothing worth mentioning. Look, I appreciate your… diligence, but I fail to see the point of this exhaustive investigation. It's simply a waste of time and resources. Frankly, I suspect my wife is exaggerating the entire situation. She tends to… fuss. Is there anything else, or may I finally depart? I have errands to run, you see. Very important errands.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Drahota. I’ll have my nurse schedule a follow-up appointment for when the results are available. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms – such as abdominal pain, jaundice, or significant weakness – please contact the clinic immediately. It's always better to err on the side of caution, even if everything turns out to be nothing serious. We'll get to the bottom of this. Now, if you'll excuse me… Have a good day.
PATIENT: “Caution” is a luxury I haven’t afforded myself in decades, Doctor. Very well. I trust this will be the end of it. Thank you for your… time. Though, I remain skeptical. Errands to run… important errands… .
