DOCTOR: Hi Jinnie, welcome. I’m Dr. Rosanova. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, good day to you, Doctor. It's…Jinnie Wartick. Yes. It's a bit embarrassing, honestly. It’s…a personal matter. A rather unpleasant personal matter, if I may say so. I’m not one to complain, but… it's something I felt I simply had to get checked. It concerns…a discharge. A man's discharge, you understand. My…associate’s discharge. Though I am the one coming in here about it.
DOCTOR: Okay, Jinnie. I understand. It sounds like you’re concerned about a discharge from your partner, and you’re seeking medical advice about it. That’s perfectly reasonable, and you’re doing the right thing by getting it checked out. Don't be embarrassed at all. We deal with all sorts of things here. To help me understand what’s going on, can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Well, it's… not constant, thankfully. It comes and goes. Mostly after… well, after intimacy. It’s not a large amount, you understand. But it's… unusual. Not the normal… after-effects, if you catch my meaning. And it's… a funny color. Not a healthy color, at all. More… yellowish, perhaps? And sometimes…a little bit green. It's rather unsettling, really. He doesn’t seem to be in any pain, which is… something, I suppose, but I worry about… consequences.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it's a yellowish-green discharge that appears after intimacy, and it's not associated with any pain in your partner. And it’s not a typical amount or color. That's helpful to know. Just to clarify, has your partner noticed any other symptoms at all?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… hmm. Let me think. He… well, he's been a bit… irritable lately. But he always has a bit of a temper, if I'm honest. It’s part of his… charm. But perhaps it’s worse than usual. And… oh. He did mention a little bit of… burning when he… well, when he uses the facilities. A slight stinging, he said. But he dismissed it as… something he ate, I believe. A bit of indigestion, he thought.
DOCTOR: Okay, so some increased irritability and a slight burning sensation during urination. That's good information. And when did you first notice the discharge?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Now, that’s a question. Let me see… It's been… a couple of weeks, I think? Perhaps three? Time does seem to… slip away, doesn't it? It wasn't immediately alarming, just… different. We had a rather… active weekend, and then I noticed it afterwards. It wasn’t a huge amount, so I didn’t think much of it at first. It’s gotten… more noticeable since then, which is why I finally decided to come in. I don't like things left unattended, you see. It just seems… improper.
DOCTOR: Okay, so about two to three weeks, following a period of increased activity. Has your partner had any previous sexually transmitted infections, or any similar symptoms before?
PATIENT: Oh, my. Now that is a delicate question, Doctor. I… truthfully, I don’t believe so. We haven't… discussed such things in great detail. He’s a… private man, you see. And I don’t pry. It’s just not… lady-like. He's always been… careful, as far as I know. Though, one can never truly know, can one? He does… frequent establishments. Let's just say he has a… varied social life. But he always… takes precautions. Or so he says.
DOCTOR: Okay. I understand. And has either of you had any new sexual partners recently?
PATIENT: Goodness, no! Absolutely not. I would never. I’ve been… quite exclusive, you see. And he… well, he has his… habits, but he assures me he’s… discerning. No new partners, Doctor. None at all. That would be… most improper. We've… maintained a certain level of… consistency. Though, as I said, he does frequent those… places. But that doesn't mean anything untoward has occurred!
DOCTOR: Okay, Jinnie. Thank you for being so open with me. Based on what you’ve told me, the discharge, especially with the slight burning during urination, could be a sign of a sexually transmitted infection, such as gonorrhea or chlamydia, or potentially another type of infection. To get a definitive answer, we'll need to do some testing. Would you be willing to let me examine your partner, or would he be willing to come in for an appointment himself?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Testing, you say? Well, that does sound… unpleasant. I'm not sure he’d be thrilled about an… examination. He’s a bit… sensitive, you see. Very proud. I suppose I could… suggest it to him. But I doubt he’ll agree willingly. Perhaps if I frame it as… a general check-up? Though he doesn’t much like doctors. Would I need to be tested as well? I do feel perfectly fine, you understand.
DOCTOR: That’s understandable. It’s often difficult to discuss these things. Yes, it would be ideal if your partner could come in for testing. However, even if he’s reluctant, you should also be tested. STIs don't always present with obvious symptoms, and it's important to rule things out for your own health, even if you're feeling fine. We can do a urine test for both of you, which is a relatively simple and non-invasive way to check for common infections. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: A urine test… for both of us? Well… that does seem… reasonable, I suppose. Less… intrusive than other options. And it’s better to be safe than sorry, as they say. Though, I still think he’ll be rather cross about it. He doesn’t like being… bothered with these things. But if it’s necessary… yes. I suppose I can convince him. Though it might require… a rather special dinner. Yes, a urine test for both of us. When can we schedule that? And will it be… expensive? I am on Medicare, you know.
DOCTOR: Okay, great. We can schedule that for either tomorrow afternoon, or early next week. It’s covered by Medicare, so there shouldn’t be any out-of-pocket costs for either of you, as long as it's deemed medically necessary, which it is in this case. In the meantime, I recommend abstaining from any sexual activity until we have the results back, to avoid potentially spreading anything. And while we wait for the results, it's also best to avoid douching or using any harsh soaps in the genital area, as that can interfere with the test accuracy. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: No sexual activity… Until the results come back? That does put a damper on things. But yes, I understand. Better to be cautious, as you say. And no… douching? I don't believe I do douche. It seems… rather unhygienic, frankly. He certainly wouldn’t approve. So, tomorrow afternoon, you said? What time would be suitable? And… will it be a… lengthy appointment? I have a bridge club meeting at four, you see. And I absolutely must be there. My partner, Beatrice, will have my hide if I'm late.
DOCTOR: Okay. Tomorrow afternoon works. How about 2:30 PM?
PATIENT: 2:30… Yes, that should work, barely. I’ll have to rush, but it’s doable. I’ll have to explain to Beatrice why I'm late. She's… a stickler for punctuality. So, 2:30 tomorrow. Just the urine tests, you said? Nothing… more invasive? I must admit, I'm still a bit nervous. He'll be dreadfully annoyed. And I’ll have to make him a particularly nice roast for dinner to appease him. Yes, 2:30. That is settled, then. Thank you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Yes, just the urine tests. And please, don’t worry, it’s a very straightforward procedure. We'll get the results as quickly as possible, and we can discuss them then. If you have any questions before tomorrow, please don't hesitate to call the office. Here’s a form to confirm the appointment details and consent for the tests. Do you have any questions before we finish up?
PATIENT: A form, you say? Yes, let me have a look. Consent… yes. Everything seems to be in order. I suppose. No, I don’t think I have any further questions at the moment. Though… I do hope the tests are quick. And that they don't reveal anything… unpleasant. Thank you again, Doctor Rosanova. You’ve been… remarkably patient with me. And hopefully, this will all be over soon. Yes, soon.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Jinnie. It was my pleasure. We’ll do our best to get everything sorted out quickly and efficiently. Don’t hesitate to call if anything comes to mind before tomorrow. Have a good afternoon, and please, try not to worry too much.
