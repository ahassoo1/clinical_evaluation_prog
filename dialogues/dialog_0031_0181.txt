DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Mombrun. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Rakosky. It's a pleasure to meet you. To start, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. It is a pleasure to meet you too. I requested a general wellness check, a lab panel, if you will. Just trying to keep an eye on things, you understand. At my age, one doesn’t want any surprises. I believe the results are ready for review?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Mombrun. A proactive approach is always wise. Yes, your lab results are available. Before we delve into those, could you briefly describe your overall health?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, overall I’d say I’m quite… serviceable. I still work – construction, you know. Keeps me moving. My wife, Elena, says I’m too stubborn to stay still for long. No major complaints, really. A little stiffness in the mornings, but nothing a good stretch doesn’t fix. And, of course, the usual aches and pains that come with seventy-four years. I eat reasonably well, mostly, and I don’t drink or smoke. Is there anything specific you’d like to know?
DOCTOR: That's good to hear, Mr. Mombrun. “Serviceable” is an excellent way to put it. The fact that you're still working in construction at seventy-four is quite remarkable. To get a more complete picture, let's go through a quick review of systems. Just tell me if you've experienced any changes or issues in these areas. Have you noticed any recent changes in your weight, appetite, or sleep patterns?
PATIENT: No significant changes, Doctor. My weight has been remarkably consistent for years – Elena keeps a watchful eye on that, I assure you! Appetite is good, perhaps a little smaller portions than when I was a younger man, but nothing to be concerned about. And sleep… well, I sleep soundly enough. Perhaps not as long as I used to, but I wake up feeling rested. Maybe six, seven hours a night. Do you want me to be more specific with anything? Sometimes I wake up to use the restroom once or twice, is that what you mean?
DOCTOR: That’s helpful, Mr. Mombrun. Yes, the nighttime trips to the restroom are good to know. That can sometimes indicate a number of things. We’ll get to that if needed. Now, have you experienced any chest pain, shortness of breath, or palpitations?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, thankfully not. No chest pain whatsoever. Shortness of breath… perhaps if I’m carrying something particularly heavy up a long set of stairs, but that’s just from exertion, I’d imagine. Not anything that would concern me. And no palpitations. My heart feels… steady. Elena always says I worry too much, but I’d say it feels quite normal. I did have a bout of the flu last winter, a nasty one, but I recovered fully. Is that relevant?
DOCTOR: Yes, the bout of flu is relevant. It’s good to have that information. Now, let's move on to your digestive system. Have you experienced any nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, or changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: No nausea or vomiting, Doctor. Thankfully, my stomach has always been quite strong. As for diarrhea or constipation… occasional mild constipation, perhaps once every few weeks, but nothing a bit of extra water and fruit doesn't resolve. No significant changes in bowel habits, no. Regular as clockwork, you might say. Elena would certainly attest to that! Is this all routine, Doctor? I’m not trying to be difficult, but it feels a little… intrusive, discussing these things.
DOCTOR: You’re not being difficult at all, Mr. Mombrun. It’s perfectly reasonable to feel that way. It is a bit intrusive, and I apologize if it feels that way. These questions are simply part of a comprehensive wellness check to ensure we haven’t missed anything. Now, how about your urinary system?
PATIENT: Ah, the urinary system. As I mentioned earlier, I do wake up once or twice during the night to urinate. It’s not bothersome, really, but it’s… more frequent than it used to be, naturally. No pain or burning, no blood in the urine, no difficulty starting or stopping. Just… a little more frequent. I suppose that’s the main thing. Is that what you were asking about? And… is that concerning, Doctor? Elena has been suggesting I see someone about it for a while, but I always put it off.
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful, Mr. Mombrun. The increased frequency, without pain or burning, is something we should investigate further. Your wife is right to suggest we look into it. It could be a number of things, most likely related to age and prostate health. Let’s move on to your musculoskeletal system. Do you have any joint pain, muscle weakness, or limitations in your range of motion?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, after a lifetime of construction, one develops a certain… familiarity with aches and pains. My knees sometimes stiffen up in the mornings, and my lower back aches if I’ve been lifting something particularly heavy. Range of motion… it’s not what it used to be, naturally. I can still manage most things, but bending over is a little more difficult. No weakness, per se, just… stiffness and the occasional twinge. Elena insists on giving me a massage every evening, which helps considerably. I used to play soccer quite a bit when I was younger, a long time ago. I injured my ankle back then, it occasionally bothers me in cold weather. Is that relevant?
DOCTOR: Yes, the history of the ankle injury is relevant. And it’s good that Elena is providing massages, that's excellent. Now, let’s talk about your neurological system. Have you experienced any headaches, dizziness, vision changes, memory problems, or numbness or tingling in your extremities?
PATIENT: No headaches to speak of, Doctor. Perhaps a mild tension headache if I’m particularly stressed, but nothing that requires medication. No dizziness. Vision is… not as sharp as it used to be, naturally, but I wear reading glasses. Memory… well, at seventy-four, one forgets things occasionally. But nothing alarming. I remember things quite clearly, really. Elena keeps me sharp, she’s always quizzing me on things. No numbness or tingling. Everything feels… normal. I suppose I’m a little slower to react than I used to be, but that’s just age, isn’t it? Is there anything specific you’re looking for?
DOCTOR: That's good to hear, Mr. Mombrun. It sounds like your neurological function is quite intact. Now, finally, let’s discuss your mental and emotional health. Have you been feeling anxious, depressed, or having any trouble sleeping?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, thankfully not. I’m quite content, you see. Elena and I have a good life, a very good life. I enjoy my work, keeps me busy. I have my friends, we get together occasionally. I sleep soundly enough, as I mentioned earlier. Perhaps a little melancholy sometimes, thinking about the past, old friends who are no longer with us, but nothing that concerns me. I wouldn’t describe myself as anxious or depressed. I have things to be grateful for. Is that… satisfactory? I worry about my grandchildren, naturally, but that’s just a grandfather’s concern. Is there anything specific you're looking for?
DOCTOR: That is more than satisfactory, Mr. Mombrun. It sounds like you have a very positive outlook on life, and that's wonderful. Now, let’s review your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any chronic conditions, such as diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart disease?
PATIENT: No chronic conditions, Doctor. Never. I’ve been remarkably lucky in that regard. My blood pressure has been slightly elevated on occasion, the nurse mentioned it during my last checkup, but nothing that required medication. No diabetes, no heart disease, no surgeries. Just a few minor injuries over the years, from construction work, nothing serious. I’ve always been careful, you see. And I try to eat healthy, mostly. I do enjoy a good arepa on occasion, Elena makes a wonderful arepa… but I try to balance it out. Is that… important? Knowing about the arepa?
DOCTOR: The arepa is not necessarily important, Mr. Mombrun, but it paints a more complete picture. It’s good to know your dietary habits. So, no chronic conditions, no surgeries, that's excellent. What about your family history?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, my father lived to be eighty-seven, but he had a weak heart towards the end. He wasn't one for exercise, you see. My mother lived to be ninety-two, quite a remarkable woman. She had arthritis, it bothered her towards the end, but otherwise, she was quite healthy. My brother, he’s still alive, thankfully, he has high cholesterol, he takes medication for it. On Elena’s side… her mother had diabetes, and her father had high blood pressure. That’s about it, really. Nothing too alarming. Both sides of the family tend to live to a good age, thankfully. Does that… help? Knowing about the cholesterol and the diabetes? I try to be mindful of those things, you see.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's very helpful, Mr. Mombrun. The family history of heart disease, diabetes, and high blood pressure is good to know, and it explains why we want to monitor your levels closely. Now, let’s talk about your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, never. I’ve never touched a cigarette in my life. Elena would never allow it, she’s very strict about that. And I don’t drink alcohol, either. I tried a glass of wine once, many years ago, didn’t care for it. And recreational drugs… absolutely not. I’ve always been a very… sensible man, you see. I find enough enjoyment in life without those things. Work, family, friends… that’s enough for me. Is that… unusual? Not drinking or smoking? I suppose it is becoming less common these days.
DOCTOR: No, Mr. Mombrun, it is not unusual. In fact, it's quite commendable. A healthy lifestyle is always a good thing. Now, finally, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing at all. Not even aspirin. I don't believe in taking unnecessary medication, you see. I try to keep myself healthy through diet and exercise. Elena does give me a vitamin D supplement occasionally, in the winter months, when there isn’t much sunshine, but that’s the only thing. I did try a glucosamine supplement a few years ago, for my knees, but it didn't seem to make much difference. So, I stopped taking it. Does that… complete the picture? I know I’ve given you a lot of information. I apologize if I’ve rambled on.
DOCTOR: No, not at all, Mr. Mombrun. You haven’t rambled at all. You’ve provided a very thorough medical history, and I appreciate your honesty and openness. Now, I’d like to perform a brief physical exam, if that’s alright with you. It will just involve listening to your heart and lungs, checking your blood pressure and pulse, and feeling your abdomen. It will only take a few minutes. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly fine. Please, go ahead. I have no objections at all. I trust your judgment. I am a practical man, you see. A checkup is a sensible thing to do. Please, don't hesitate to let me know if you need me to do anything.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Mombrun. Let’s start with your blood pressure. Blood pressure is 142 over 88. A little elevated, as the nurse noted, but not significantly concerning. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, non-distended. No masses or organomegaly appreciated. Pulse is 72 and regular. Everything sounds and feels within normal limits, Mr. Mombrun, but the slightly elevated blood pressure is something we need to monitor. Now, I have your lab results here. Your cholesterol is slightly elevated, and your glucose is borderline. Everything else is within normal limits.
PATIENT: Borderline glucose, you say? That is concerning. Elena has been saying I should cut back on the sweets… perhaps I haven’t been listening to her enough. And the cholesterol… my brother has the same problem. What does this mean, Doctor? Will I need medication? Or can I manage this through diet and exercise? Elena is quite strict about my diet, you know. I suppose I could cut back on the arepas… but they are so delicious! Please, be honest with me, Doctor. I would like to know what I need to do to stay healthy.
DOCTOR: That’s a very sensible question, Mr. Mombrun. And a very important one. The glucose is slightly elevated at 115, and your cholesterol is 220. These are not drastically high numbers, and we don’t need to rush into medication at this point. However, these numbers do indicate that you are at risk for developing diabetes and heart disease. And you’re right to be concerned. The good news is, these conditions are often manageable with lifestyle changes. Specifically, diet and exercise. Cutting back on sweets and processed foods, and increasing your physical activity, can often bring these numbers down. I recommend a low-sodium, low-sugar, low-fat diet, rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. And at least 30 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise most days of the week. We can also schedule a consultation with a registered dietitian to help you create a personalized meal plan. And I'd like to recheck your levels in three months to see how you're doing. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly reasonable. A dietitian would be most helpful, Elena would insist on it, actually. And I suppose I could cut back on the sweets. It won’t be easy, but I can try. Thirty minutes of exercise… I still do a fair amount of physical work, but perhaps I need to be more deliberate about it. Three months… that gives me time to make some changes. I would like to avoid medication if possible, you understand. I prefer to manage things naturally. And I appreciate your honesty, Doctor. You haven’t sugarcoated anything. So, let’s schedule the appointment with the dietitian. And I’ll make sure to increase my exercise and watch my diet. I’ll do my best, Doctor. For Elena, and for myself. And… thank you. This has been most helpful.
DOCTOR: Excellent, Mr. Mombrun. That's a very positive attitude, and I’m confident you can make these changes. I’ll schedule you an appointment with Sarah Miller, a registered dietitian, for next week. I’ll also give you a handout with some information about healthy eating and exercise. I want to emphasize that I’m here to support you every step of the way. If you have any questions or concerns, please don’t hesitate to call the office. For now, let's review your medication list, which is currently empty. I recommend continuing to monitor your blood pressure at home, and I’ll provide you with a device for that. Are there any other questions or concerns you have for me today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I believe that covers everything. Monitoring the blood pressure… that’s a good idea. Elena has been nagging me about that too. I appreciate you providing the device. And the appointment with the dietitian. I suppose it’s time to take this seriously. I am a practical man, you see. If there is something I need to do to stay healthy, I will do it. Thank you again, Doctor. You have been most helpful and reassuring. I feel much better now, knowing what I need to do. I appreciate your time, Doctor Rakosky. And I look forward to seeing you in three months.
DOCTOR: It was my pleasure meeting you, Mr. Mombrun. I’m confident you’ll do well, and I look forward to seeing you then as well. Please, don't hesitate to call if you have any questions before your follow-up appointment. The nurse will be with you shortly to schedule the dietitian appointment and provide you with the blood pressure device. Have a good day, Mr. Mombrun. And please, give my best to Elena.
PATIENT: .
