DOCTOR: Right, Velda Squiers. 45 years old. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor. It's about a cruise, actually. I'm hoping you can help me with a wee bit of paperwork. They need some information about my health before I can go, and I thought it best to get it from a professional, like yourself. It’s for a trip in November, if that’s alright.
DOCTOR: November… paperwork. Yes, alright. Cruise lines and their forms. It's always something. Let’s get this over with then. So, they just need a general health overview?
PATIENT: Aye, that’s right. Mostly just confirming things, I suppose. They asked about any serious illnesses, operations, and… well, things like that. I’ve not been terribly ill, thankfully. Just the usual bumps and bruises over the years, nothing that needed a hospital visit, if you catch my meaning. Would a list be helpful, or are you wanting to ask directly? I’m happy either way.
DOCTOR: A list would be helpful, actually. Saves us both some time. Though, I'll still need to ask a few clarifying questions, naturally. It's just... people tend to forget details. Start with any serious illnesses you do recall, even if it was years ago. And then, anything requiring surgery, even minor procedures. Don't leave anything out, alright?
PATIENT: Right you are, Doctor. Well… let me see. The most significant thing, I suppose, was when I was a wee girl, maybe seven or eight, I had rheumatic fever. It kept me in bed for quite a while, but the doctor – Dr. MacLeod, a lovely man – said it didn’t do any lasting damage. And then… when I was about twenty, I had my appendix out. Routine, thankfully, no complications. Apart from the usual soreness afterwards. Oh! And I broke my wrist when I was thirty, skiing. A clean break, but it healed well. That's all I can think of, off the top of my head. I haven’t had much trouble since, touch wood.
DOCTOR: Rheumatic fever… alright. That can have long-term implications, even if Dr. MacLeod said it didn't. We'll need to keep that in mind. And appendix and wrist, both uncomplicated, good. Now, let’s move on. Do you have any ongoing medical conditions?
PATIENT: Ongoing…? Hmm. Well, nothing that a doctor’s ever told me was ongoing, if that makes sense. I get a bit of trouble with my knees now and then, especially in cold weather. A bit stiff, you know? My husband used to say it was all the gardening. He was right, I expect. And I wear glasses, of course, but you can likely see that. Apart from that, I'm fairly… robust, I'd say. Not much bothers me, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Knees… gardening. Right. And the glasses. Any pain relievers you take for the knees?
PATIENT: Oh, just over-the-counter things, Doctor. Paracetamol, mostly. Or ibuprofen if they’re particularly bad. Nothing prescribed, mind you. I don't like taking too many pills if I can avoid it. Just enough to get me through a bit of weeding. It’s usually just a matter of resting them for a wee while, and they’re grand again. I’ve never had them properly looked at, to be honest. I’ve always just managed.
DOCTOR: Alright. Over-the-counter pain relief. We'll make a note of that. Now, do you have any allergies?
PATIENT: Not that I’m aware of, Doctor. Never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. I can eat all sorts of things, and I’ve never had trouble with insect bites or anything like that. My husband used to tease me, saying I was too hardy for my own good. He was a bit of a worrier, he was. But no, no allergies as far as I know.
DOCTOR: Alright. No known allergies. Good. Now, are you currently taking any medications, besides the occasional paracetamol or ibuprofen?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not a one. Just the usual over-the-counter things when I need them. I don’t like being reliant on pills, as I said. I prefer to keep things natural, if you understand. A bit of rest and a good cup of tea usually does the trick. I haven’t had a prescription filled in… oh, goodness, it must be ten years or more. Probably longer. Perhaps even twenty.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, that’s… helpful. Now, let’s just do a quick physical exam, just to be thorough. It’s standard procedure, especially for a cruise. We’ll check your blood pressure, pulse, and listen to your heart and lungs. And I'll take a look at those knees. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Aye, that’s fine, Doctor. Perfectly alright. I’ve nothing to hide, as they say. A quick check is sensible, I suppose. It’s better to be safe than sorry, especially with a cruise planned. I do hope it doesn't take too long, though. I have a bit of gardening I was hoping to get done this afternoon. But feel free to take your time, if you need to.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you could just sit up on the examination table for me. I’ll start with your blood pressure. 140 over 85… a little elevated, but not terribly concerning. Pulse is 72, regular. Now, take a deep breath for me… and another… good. Lungs sound clear. Heart sounds… regular rhythm, slight murmur, but likely benign. Now, let’s take a look at those knees. If you could just bend them for me, as far as is comfortable.
PATIENT: Right you are, Doctor. Ooh, that's a bit stiff. They’re worse when it’s cold, you see. Feels like a bit of grating, sometimes. Not much pain, more just… awkward. Like they need a good oiling, if you catch my meaning. It’s probably just age, I expect. I was always very active, you see. Always pottering about in the garden. They're not too bad, really. I can manage, you know. Just a bit of a creak now and then.
DOCTOR: There's some crepitus, as you said. Mild swelling, and tenderness along the medial joint line on both sides. Range of motion is slightly limited. It appears to be osteoarthritis, likely from previous activity. Nothing acute, but it's something to be aware of. Reflexes are normal. Alright. That's all for the physical exam.
PATIENT: Osteo… what was it now? Oh, arthritis. That's what my mother had. Mostly in her hands, though. Is it serious, Doctor? Will I need… injections, or something? I’m not terribly keen on needles, if I’m honest. And I’d like to still be able to potter about in the garden, if possible. It's my favourite thing, you see.
DOCTOR: It's mild osteoarthritis, Mrs. Squiers. It’s a degenerative joint condition, common with age and activity. It’s not serious in the sense that it's not life-threatening, but it can cause discomfort and limit mobility if left unmanaged. Injections are an option, but we’ll start with conservative management. Weight management – you’re a bit underweight, which isn’t ideal for joint health – and regular, low-impact exercise. And over-the-counter pain relief as needed. We can discuss physiotherapy if it doesn’t improve. As for gardening, you can continue, but modify your activities. Avoid heavy lifting and prolonged kneeling. It's important to be realistic, Mrs. Squiers. You're not as young as you once were. A bit of sensible self-management is all that’s required for now. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Aye, Doctor. I understand. Sensible self-management. It’s just… I enjoy my gardening. It keeps me active, you see. And I am rather fond of it. Low-impact exercise… I suppose a bit of walking would be alright. And I’ll try to be more careful in the garden. Avoid the heavy lifting, you said. Will it… get worse, Doctor? Will I eventually not be able to garden at all? I don't mean to be a bother, but it's rather important to me.
DOCTOR: It’s difficult to say definitively, Mrs. Squiers. Osteoarthritis is progressive, but the rate of progression varies greatly from person to person. With appropriate management, you may be able to maintain your current level of activity for many years. But it’s important to be prepared for potential limitations in the future. Look, I'll write a referral to a physiotherapist. They can provide you with specific exercises and advice for managing your condition. And I’ll send you home with information on osteoarthritis and low-impact exercises. I don't want you worrying needlessly. Sensible self-management, that’s all it takes. Now, do you have any other concerns before we finish?
PATIENT: Aye, alright. A physiotherapist sounds sensible. And I’ll try to be more careful, I promise. No, Doctor, I don’t think that’s all. I was just wondering… would this arthritis… would it affect my cruise? Would it be alright for me to travel? I’ve already paid for it, you see. And I’m rather looking forward to it.
DOCTOR: Honestly, Mrs. Squiers. You’re asking a doctor to approve a holiday based on mild knee arthritis?
PATIENT: Well, I just thought… if I couldn’t walk very well, or if it flared up… I didn’t want to be a burden on anyone. And I’d hate to have to cancel the trip. It’s… it’s a long way to go, you see. I was hoping for a bit of reassurance. It’s just a silly worry, I expect.
DOCTOR: Look, Mrs. Squiers. As long as you’re able to manage your symptoms with over-the-counter pain relief and sensible activity modification, there’s no medical reason why you shouldn't go on your cruise. However, I strongly advise you to discuss your condition with the cruise line’s medical facility upon arrival. They can provide further advice and assistance if needed. I’ll print you a summary of our consultation and the referral to physiotherapy. Is there anything else, or shall we finish?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, that’s grand. That’s very kind of you. A summary and the referral… perfect. Thank you for your time, Doctor. And for… putting up with my silly worries. I'll be sure to speak to the medical facility on the cruise ship. And I’ll try to be sensible. Goodbye, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, enjoy your cruise, Mrs. Squiers. And try not to overdo it. .
