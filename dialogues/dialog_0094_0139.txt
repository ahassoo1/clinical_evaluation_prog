PATIENT: Referee. For basketball. Need paper say I okay to do it. My wife… she… used to help with this. Now… just me. Quick check is good?
DOCTOR: I understand, a physical exam to confirm you are fit to referee basketball. Yes, we can definitely do a quick check-up for that. It’s good your wife helped previously – it’s always helpful to have some background. Just to be thorough, and to make sure I have everything I need for the paperwork, could you tell me a little more about what specifically the requirements are for this fitness evaluation?
PATIENT: Requirements? Hmm… not sure. League… they just want doctor say I healthy. No problem with heart, or… running. Usual things, I think? I not good with… details. Sorry.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all, Mr. Shanor. That's perfectly alright. We'll cover the usual things, as you said. Let's start with your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions, such as high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: No. Not me. Wife… she had… a little bit of blood pressure. But not me. Always healthy. Work hard, you know? Lifting, fixing… always moving. I think.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear, Mr. Shanor. Working hard certainly contributes to good health. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No surgery. Never. Maybe… broken finger when little boy. But not hospital. Wife fixed it. Good hands, she had. Now… just me again. Sorry. I keep talking about her.
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Mr. Shanor. It sounds like she was a very capable woman. No need to apologize at all. So, no surgeries or hospitalizations. Now, let’s talk about your family. Is there any history of heart disease, stroke, or other serious medical conditions in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… Grandfather… he had… something with chest. Old age, I think. Maybe heart? Not sure. Mother… she okay. Always healthy, like me. Wife’s side… I not know her family very well. We meet late in life. Sorry, Doctor. I not good remembering.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Shanor. You’ve provided helpful information. A family history of chest issues is good to know. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies. I eat everything. My wife… she had… little bit of shellfish. But not me. Always strong stomach, I think. Never had trouble.
DOCTOR: Good. And currently, are you taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No. Nothing. Just… work. And coffee. Lots of coffee. Need energy, you know? For lifting, fixing, refereeing. That's all.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Shanor. Coffee is a very common medication! Alright, let's move on to a quick physical exam. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and do a basic neurological assessment. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes. Sounds… quick. Good. Let’s do it. Want finish fast, if okay. Paper… is important for league.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. We’ll make it as quick as possible. Please have a seat and I'll begin. Your blood pressure is a little elevated at 130 over 82. It's not drastically high, but we'll keep an eye on it. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take deep breaths. Your heart sounds good – regular rhythm, no murmurs. Lungs are clear as well. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes.
PATIENT: Reflexes? Okay. I always… strong. Lifting, you know? Strong arms. Do quickly, please. Paper... important.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. Your reflexes are good and your strength is normal. Finally, I'll just quickly check your pulse at your wrists. Pulse is good, 78 and regular. Everything seems to be within normal limits so far. Do you have any current pain or discomfort anywhere?
PATIENT: No pain. Maybe… little bit back. From lifting. Old job. But okay now. Always stretch. Wife… she show me. Good stretches. But no real pain. Just… tired sometimes.
DOCTOR: That's good that you're managing it with stretches. So, to summarize, you're a 31-year-old male presenting for a fitness evaluation to confirm you’re healthy enough to referee basketball. You have no known medical conditions, no surgeries, and no allergies. Your family history is unremarkable, you don't take any medications, and your physical exam is normal with mild occasional back discomfort. I think we have enough information to proceed. Based on my examination today, I don't see any reason why you wouldn't be able to safely referee basketball. I'll document my findings and provide you with a note for the league stating that you are medically cleared for full activity. However, it’s important to remember to listen to your body and rest when needed. I would recommend continuing to stretch regularly, especially your back, and maintaining a healthy lifestyle. Does that sound good to you?
PATIENT: Yes. Sounds… good. Paper is most important thing. Thank you, Doctor. Want to go now, if okay? Want to tell league. Very important.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Shanor. I’ll have the note printed for you right away. Here you go. This confirms you are cleared for full activity. Do you have any questions for me before you leave?
PATIENT: No. Thank you. Very much. You… good doctor. Goodbye now.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Shanor. I’m glad I could help. Have a great day, and be careful out there! .
