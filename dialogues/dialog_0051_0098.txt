DOCTOR: Good morning, Demondre. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Glazewski. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Well, to be honest, I just... wanted to check things out. Been feeling okay, mostly. Just curious, you know? Never really been to a doctor much before.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Demondre. Preventative care is excellent. It's good you're being proactive. “Checking things out” is a great reason to come in. To help me get a better picture of your overall health, could you tell me a little more about what “feeling okay” means to you?
PATIENT: Hmm... okay. Well, I sleep alright, I guess. Not amazing, but not bad. Work’s work, you know? Long hours on the ships, but I’m used to it. No real pains or anything. Just... tired a lot. And maybe a little bit slower than I used to be, doing things. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. Tiredness and a sense of slowing down… those are definitely things worth looking into. You mentioned working on ships – what kind of work do you do there, and how long have you been doing it?
PATIENT: I'm a sailor and a marine oiler. Basically, I keep the engines running smooth and clean. Lots of greasing and checking levels and stuff. Been doing it... uh... about six years now, since I left home. It’s pretty rough work, sometimes. Long trips, you know? And not always the best food.
DOCTOR: Six years… that's a good stretch of time with physically demanding work. And you're right to mention the food; diet can play a big role in energy levels. Do you notice any specific times of day when the tiredness is worse, or anything that seems to make it better or worse?
PATIENT: Hmm... it's usually worse towards the end of a trip, I think. When we’re getting back to port. And after a really long shift, definitely. Nothing really makes it better, except... maybe sleep? But even then, I don't wake up feeling great, you know? Just... less tired.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful. It sounds like it's connected to your work schedule, which isn’t surprising. Now, just to get a more complete picture, I'm going to ask you a few more general health questions, if that’s alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, that's fine. Go ahead.
DOCTOR: Great. Have you had any significant illnesses or injuries in the past?
PATIENT: Not really. I broke my arm when I was a kid, fell out of a tree. And I’ve had the usual colds and stuff, but nothing major. Never been to the hospital for anything serious. Oh, wait… I had a really bad flu a couple of years ago. Knocked me out for a week, but I just stayed home and slept it off.
DOCTOR: Okay, a broken arm as a child, a recent flu… good to know. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Nope. Never had surgery. I try to stay out of hospitals if I can.
DOCTOR: Fair enough. Now, are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm... that's a tough one. My mom… she had high blood pressure, I think. And my grandpa on my dad’s side had something with his heart, I think. But nobody really talked about it much. It wasn't something people shared, you know? I don't know much about it.
DOCTOR: That's alright, Demondre. It’s common for families not to discuss those things openly. High blood pressure and a heart condition… we'll keep that in mind. Now, are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Nope. Nothing at all. I don't really believe in taking pills unless I really need to. Just try to eat okay and get enough sleep when I can.
DOCTOR: Okay. And do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope. Not that I know of. Never had a bad reaction to anything. I think I get itchy sometimes if I'm around cats, but that's it. Not a real allergy, just... itchy.
DOCTOR: Alright, Demondre. That gives me a good starting point. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if you don't mind. Just listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and a few other basic things. It shouldn’t take long. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that's fine. Go ahead. I don't mind.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Let’s start with your blood pressure. Okay, your blood pressure is a little elevated at 138/88. Your heart sounds regular, but a little fast. Lungs are clear. I'm going to listen again and palpate your abdomen. Your abdomen is soft and non-tender. No masses or organomegaly. I'm going to check your reflexes now. Your reflexes are normal. Overall, your physical exam is fairly unremarkable, but the elevated blood pressure and slightly elevated heart rate are worth investigating further.
PATIENT: Okay. Elevated blood pressure... is that bad? Should I be worried? What does investigating further mean? Will I have to get poked a lot?
DOCTOR: It’s good you’re asking questions, Demondre. Elevated blood pressure isn't necessarily a cause for panic, but it’s something we need to take seriously. It can contribute to more serious problems down the road if left unmanaged. “Investigating further” means we'll likely need to do some blood work to get a better understanding of your overall health and rule out any underlying causes for the elevated pressure. We might also want to do a simple EKG to check your heart rhythm. As for being “poked a lot,” the blood work will involve a small needle prick, but it’s usually quick and doesn’t hurt too much. The EKG involves placing some sticky pads on your chest – no needles involved there. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Okay... blood work and sticky pads. That doesn't sound too bad. I guess if it's important, I can do it. What kind of things are you looking for in the blood work? Like, what if something's wrong?
DOCTOR: That's a very good question. We'll be looking at a standard panel of things – your cholesterol levels, kidney function, liver function, blood sugar, and some basic electrolytes. This will give us a broad overview of how your body is functioning. If something is off, it doesn’t automatically mean something terrible is wrong. It just means we need to investigate further and figure out what’s causing it. It could be something as simple as a temporary infection, or it could be a sign of a more underlying condition. The good news is, most of these things are manageable with lifestyle changes or medication. We'll discuss all the results with you thoroughly and come up with a plan together. I'm going to order those blood tests for you now, and we can schedule an EKG for next week. Would that work?
PATIENT: Okay... that sounds better, knowing you'll explain everything. Yeah, next week for the EKG is fine. Is there anything I should do before the blood work? Like, should I eat anything special? Or not drink coffee?
DOCTOR: Good question. For the blood work, it’s best to fast for at least 8-12 hours beforehand. That means no food or sugary drinks. You can drink water. And yes, it's best to avoid caffeine for at least 24 hours before the test, as it can affect the results. I'll give you a lab requisition form with all the instructions written down. The lab is located just down the street, so it should be convenient. I’ll also schedule a follow-up appointment for about a week after your tests, so we can discuss the results together. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds good. No food, no coffee, got it. I can do that. Okay, good. I'm glad we're getting this checked out. Thank you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Demondre. I'm glad you came in. Proactive care is always a good thing. I'll print out those instructions and the lab requisition form for you now. And here’s a card with my contact information, if you have any questions before your follow-up appointment. We’ll get these tests done and figure out what’s going on. Don’t hesitate to reach out if anything concerns you. Do you have any other questions for me before we finish up?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. You explained everything really well. Thank you again, Doctor. I appreciate it.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Demondre. I'm glad I could help. Take care, and I'll see you next week.
