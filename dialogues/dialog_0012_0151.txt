DOCTOR: Hi Teretha, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Yoshino. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, it’s this tingling… in my hands and feet, mostly. It’s been going on for a little while now, and it's just… annoying, you know? It's not painful, exactly, but it's there. I just want to know what’s causing it, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense, Teretha. Annoying symptoms can be really disruptive, even if they aren’t painful. Okay, tingling in your hands and feet… and you said it’s been going on for “a little while.” Can you give me a better sense of how long?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It started… maybe three months ago? At first, it was just now and then, like when I was really tired after a long day on my route. But lately, it's been pretty much constant. It doesn’t go away completely anymore, even when I rest. It's worse in the evenings, I think. Does that help?
DOCTOR: That does help, thank you. So, three months, starting intermittent and now pretty constant, worse in the evenings… Okay. And is it just tingling, or would you describe it as numbness, burning, or anything else besides tingling?
PATIENT: Just tingling, really. Not burning, not numb… well, sometimes my fingers feel a little… clumsy? Like I might drop something. But mostly just the tingling. It's like… pins and needles, you know? Especially in my thumbs and big toes. Is that normal?
DOCTOR: Okay, tingling, pins and needles, especially in the thumbs and big toes… and some clumsiness. That's helpful. Has anything specific brought on the tingling, or made it worse besides being tired or the time of day?
PATIENT: You know, now that you mention it… I did have a fall a few months back. Just tripped on a cracked sidewalk while I was delivering mail. Didn't think much of it at the time, just bruised my knee. But maybe that has something to do with it? I didn't go to the doctor for the fall, honestly. Just put some ice on it.
DOCTOR: Okay, a fall a few months ago, bruised your knee, and didn’t seek medical attention. That’s good to know. It could be related. To get a better picture, can you tell me about any other symptoms you're experiencing?
PATIENT: Let me see… well, I’ve been feeling a little more tired than usual, but honestly, who isn't these days? I'm 63, you know? And my balance hasn’t been the best lately, which is why I probably fell in the first place. Other than that… no, not really. I haven’t noticed anything else. I don’t have any aches or pains, no weakness… just the tingling and the tiredness.
DOCTOR: Okay, tiredness and some balance issues in addition to the tingling. And no other aches, pains, or weakness. Have you noticed any changes in your skin color or temperature in your hands or feet?
PATIENT: Skin color? No, I don’t think so. They look… normal, I guess? Maybe a little paler than usual, now that you mention it. But I don’t spend a lot of time looking at my hands and feet, if I’m being honest! And no, they don’t feel particularly cold or warm. They just… tingle. I'm really hoping you can figure out what’s going on. I need to get back to work, you know? The mail doesn't deliver itself!
DOCTOR: I understand, Teretha, and we’ll do our best to figure it out. Okay, so no noticeable color changes or temperature differences. Let's talk a little about your medical history. Do you have any known medical conditions, like diabetes, thyroid problems, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… I had high blood pressure for a while, but it's been under control with medication for years now. Other than that… not really. I had a hysterectomy when I was younger, but that was a long time ago. Nothing else that I can think of. I don't go to the doctor much, honestly. I always try to tough things out. I don’t like being a bother.
DOCTOR: Okay, high blood pressure, well-controlled with medication, and a hysterectomy in the past. And you generally don't seek medical attention unless you absolutely have to. That’s good to know. Are you currently taking any medications for your blood pressure or anything else?
PATIENT: Yes, I take Lisinopril, 20 milligrams, once a day. That's for the blood pressure. And… oh, sometimes I take ibuprofen for aches and pains, but not regularly. Just when I really need it. Like after I tripped and bruised my knee. That's about it. I don't take a lot of pills, if you know what I mean.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril 20mg daily for blood pressure and occasional ibuprofen. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I've never had a reaction to anything. I can eat anything, take any medicine… well, except maybe I don’t like the taste of penicillin, but that’s just a preference, not an allergy. Honestly, I don’t think I’m allergic to anything. I’m pretty lucky that way. Can we get back to the tingling now? I really want to know what’s causing it.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. That’s good. To get a better picture, let's talk about your family history. Has anyone in your family had diabetes, nerve problems, or anything similar?
PATIENT: Oh, my family… let me think. My mother had arthritis, pretty bad towards the end of her life. And my father had heart problems. But I don’t think anyone had diabetes or nerve problems, not that I remember. We didn't talk about those things much. It was a different time, you know? People didn't share their health problems like they do now. Is that helpful? I'm not sure I'm very good at this family history stuff.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Teretha. It’s helpful to know. Okay, mother had arthritis, father had heart problems, no known diabetes or nerve problems. And finally, could you tell me a little about your social history?
PATIENT: Social history? Oh dear. What does that mean? You mean… my job? I’m a postal carrier, like I said. I’ve been delivering mail for… goodness, almost 30 years now! It’s a good job, keeps me busy. I live alone since my husband passed away. I have a few friends, but mostly I keep to myself. I don’t smoke, and I rarely drink alcohol. I used to garden a lot, but my knees aren’t what they used to be, so I don’t do that much anymore. Is that what you wanted to know? I feel like I'm giving you my life story here!
DOCTOR: That's exactly what I wanted to know, Teretha. Thank you for sharing all of that. It gives me a much better understanding of your overall health. So, you're a postal carrier of 30 years, live alone, no smoking or drinking, and some limitations with gardening due to knee issues. Okay, with all that information, I'd like to do a quick physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that's fine. Whatever you need to do. I just want to know what’s causing this tingling. The sooner we figure it out, the sooner I can get back to work! I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s start with your hands. Please relax your arms at your sides. I'm going to tap on your reflexes now. Okay, reflexes are… 2+ bilaterally, which is normal. Now, can you squeeze my fingers?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Is that alright? I'm trying to squeeze as hard as I can. It feels a little weird with the tingling, you know? It makes it hard to tell how much strength I have.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's good, that feels strong. About 5 out of 5 on both sides. Now, I'm going to touch different parts of your hands with this. Just tell me when you feel the sensation. Can you tell me when you feel this?
PATIENT: Yes, I feel that. And that… and that. Wait a minute… that one… on my thumb, feels… a little different. Not as strong, maybe? It's hard to explain. It's still there, but it's… muted? Like it's further away. Is that what you mean? The tingling is making it hard to tell what I'm feeling.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s exactly what I mean. It sounds like there may be some decreased sensation in your thumb. Now, let’s move to your feet. Please relax your legs. I'll be doing the same tests on your feet as I did with your hands. We'll check your reflexes, strength, and sensation. Okay, reflexes are… 2+ bilaterally in your feet as well. Now, can you push your foot against my hand like you’re pressing on a gas pedal?
PATIENT: Yes, I can do that. Is that strong enough? It's a little harder to do this sitting down. I usually have more leverage when I’m standing, you know? It feels a bit wobbly.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's good. About 5 out of 5, but I noticed you had some difficulty maintaining balance. Now, let's check sensation in your feet. Just tell me when you feel the sensation.
PATIENT: Yes, I feel that. And that… and that. Oh, wait. My big toe… that feels… different too. It's not as strong as the others. It feels… kind of numb, almost. And it tingles more when you touch it. It’s hard to explain. It’s like… a prickly tingling. Is that what you mean? It feels weird. I’m sorry, I’m not very good at describing this.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Teretha. You’re describing it just fine. Decreased sensation and increased tingling in your big toe and some decreased sensation in your thumb… and some balance issues. Based on the exam and your history, it sounds like you may have peripheral neuropathy. This means there’s some damage to the nerves in your hands and feet. There are many potential causes, including diabetes, vitamin deficiencies, certain medications, and even just age. However, it’s important to rule out other possibilities. To help narrow down the cause, I'd like to order some blood tests. This will include a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, a vitamin B12 level, and a thyroid stimulating hormone level. We’ll also check your blood sugar to rule out diabetes. Would that be okay with you?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Neuropathy… that sounds serious. Blood tests… yes, okay. Whatever you think is best. I just want to know what’s wrong, and what I can do about it. I don’t like the sound of that damage, though. It sounds painful. Will the tests tell me if it's from the blood pressure medicine? Because I don’t want to stop taking that, if it’s keeping me healthy. And how long will it take to get the results? I really need to get back to work, you know? The route won't deliver itself! .
DOCTOR: It's understandable to be concerned, Teretha. We’ll get to the bottom of this. The blood tests can help us determine if the neuropathy is related to your blood pressure medication, or another potential cause like a vitamin deficiency. We absolutely won’t make any changes to your medication without knowing the results first. The lab results usually take about 3-5 business days to come back. I’ll have my nurse call you as soon as they’re available. In the meantime, it’s important to avoid any activities that worsen your symptoms. If your symptoms worsen significantly, or you develop any new symptoms like weakness or difficulty walking, please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
