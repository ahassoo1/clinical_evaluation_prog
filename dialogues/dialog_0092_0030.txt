DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Purtee. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Giganti. It’s a pleasure to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, it’s a bit embarrassing, but I’ve noticed a change in my… body odor, I guess you’d call it. It just doesn’t smell like me anymore, if that makes sense. It’s been going on for a few weeks now.
DOCTOR: Yes, that certainly does make sense. It’s good you brought this to my attention. Changes in body odor can sometimes indicate an underlying issue, so it’s wise to get it checked out. When you say it doesn't smell like you anymore, can you describe what it does smell like now?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a tricky one. It’s not a bad smell, exactly. It’s just… different. It’s almost… sweeter, I think? And a little bit… musty? Not like mold, just… not fresh. I usually smell, well, like me – a little bit of soap and lotion, nothing strong. This is just… noticeable. I’ve tried different deodorants, but nothing seems to help.
DOCTOR: Okay, "sweeter" and "musty" – that's helpful. And you’ve noticed it despite trying different deodorants. Has this change been constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It’s pretty constant, actually. It’s not like it disappears some days and then comes back. It's there every day, all day. Though, I feel like it's a little stronger after I’ve been doing something active, like working. I lay floors, you see – not carpet or wood, the other kinds. It’s pretty physical work.
DOCTOR: I see. That’s good to know – the association with physical activity. And you lay floors – so quite a bit of exertion. Have you noticed any other changes along with this, Ms. Purtee?
PATIENT: Let me think… not really. No changes in my diet, no new medications. I haven't been feeling sick or anything. I mean, I get tired after work, but that's normal. My weight hasn't changed either. Oh! Actually… now that I think about it, I have been sweating a little more than usual, even when it's not hot. Just a little, though. Not soaking wet or anything.
DOCTOR: Okay, increased sweating, even without heat exposure. That's another piece of the puzzle. Now, let's go through a bit of your medical history, if you don't mind. Do you have any pre-existing medical conditions, such as diabetes or thyroid problems?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I had my gallbladder out a long time ago, when I was in my twenties, but that’s it. I don’t take any regular medication, except for a multivitamin sometimes. And my insurance is Medicare, so they keep pretty good track of things, I would think. I haven’t been to the doctor much in the last few years, to be honest. Just for check-ups.
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder removal many years ago and generally good health otherwise. Medicare is excellent for keeping records, you’re right. And no current medications aside from occasional multivitamins. Have there been any significant changes in your family history?
PATIENT: Hmm… that's a good question. My mother had high blood pressure, and my brother has some heart trouble. But nothing else that I can think of. They’re both… older now, so it’s hard to remember exactly what was going on when. And my father… well, he passed away a long time ago. I don't really know much about his health history.
DOCTOR: Okay, a family history of high blood pressure and heart trouble. Thank you. Now, Ms. Purtee, I’d like to ask a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, none of those. Never smoked a day in my life. I don't drink alcohol, and definitely no recreational drugs. I try to eat pretty healthy, mostly just regular food. Nothing fancy. I do drink a lot of water, though. Especially when I’m working. Keeps me going.
DOCTOR: That's very good. Healthy habits are important. Alright, Ms. Purtee, I'd like to perform a brief physical examination, if you're comfortable with that. We'll just check your vital signs – blood pressure, pulse, temperature – and I'll listen to your heart and lungs, and do a quick exam of your skin. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I’m happy to do whatever you need me to.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Let's start with your blood pressure. Just relax your arm for me… Okay, that's 130 over 80. Your pulse is 72, regular. Temperature is normal at 98.6. Now, if you'll just take a deep breath for me… Heart sounds are normal, no murmurs. Lungs are clear, no wheezing or crackles. Now, let's take a look at your skin… Skin appears normal. No rashes, lesions, or areas of concern. I do notice a faint, slightly unusual odor… slightly sweet, as you described. It’s not strong, but it is present.
PATIENT: Okay. That's good to know. So, what do you think it could be, Doctor? Is it something serious? I'm a little worried, to be honest.
DOCTOR: That’s a fair question, Ms. Purtee. Based on what you've told me and the preliminary examination, several possibilities come to mind. The changes in body odor, along with the increased sweating, could be related to hormonal changes, especially given your age. It could also be a benign change in your skin bacteria. However, to rule out other potential causes, I'd like to order some blood tests. These tests will help us assess your thyroid function, blood sugar levels, and kidney and liver function. We’ll also check for any signs of infection. It’s unlikely to be anything serious, but it's best to be thorough. Do that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds very reasonable. I'd rather be safe than sorry. So, blood tests, okay. Where do I go to get those done?
DOCTOR: Excellent. Here is a requisition for the lab work. You can go to the lab at Suburban General Hospital – it’s just down the street at 123 Main Street. They accept Medicare, so you shouldn't have any issues. It's best to fast for 12 hours beforehand – that means no food or drinks, except for water. Once the results are back – which usually takes 2-3 business days – we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, if you notice any significant changes in your condition – such as fever, chills, or a sudden increase in the odor – please don't hesitate to contact the clinic. Do you have any questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to listen and figure things out. I’ll go get the blood tests done as soon as I can.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Purtee. I’m glad I could help. We’ll get to the bottom of this. Don't hesitate to call the clinic if anything comes up. Have a good day, and please take care.
PATIENT: .
