DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Tofani. I’m Dr. Korrell. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s… it’s a bit hard to explain, honestly. My memory isn’t what it used to be. It’s mostly about… well, my daughter, bless her heart, she’s been worried about me. She said something about… feeling weak on one side? And there’s been headaches in the family, bad ones. I think my brother had them, a long time ago. But it’s all a bit fuzzy.
DOCTOR: Right, I see here your daughter expressed some concerns. Weakness on one side… and a family history of headaches. Okay. Just to clarify, Ms. Tofani, when you say weakness, where specifically are you feeling it?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… It’s not all the time, you understand. And it comes and goes. But… I think it’s mostly on my… right side? Yes, right arm and leg, I believe. Not completely gone, just… heavier. Hard to lift things sometimes, you know? And sometimes my face feels… droopy on that side too. But like I said, it doesn't happen all the time. It’s… confusing. I wish I could be more clear.
DOCTOR: Okay, intermittent weakness, primarily on the right side – arm, leg, and sometimes facial drooping. And you said this isn't constant. Can you tell me when you first noticed this weakness?
PATIENT: Oh, dear… when was it? That’s a tricky one. It feels like… a while now. Not recently, but not years and years ago either. Maybe… six months? A year? It’s hard to say, Doctor. Things all blend together after a while, you know? I just know my daughter noticed it first, when I was trying to help her with some gardening. She said I was dropping things a lot. It wasn't a big deal then, I just thought I was clumsy!
DOCTOR: Alright. So, roughly six to twelve months of intermittent weakness on the right side, noticed initially by your daughter. And you mentioned headaches in the family. Were those headaches similar to any you’ve experienced yourself, Ms. Tofani?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Well, I get headaches sometimes, nothing terrible, usually just a bit of a dull ache. But my brother… his were awful. My daughter tells me they called them migraines. He’d have to lie down in a dark room for days. I don’t remember them being quite that bad for me, but… I do get them on and off. Sometimes with a bit of nausea, but nothing… debilitating. Mostly just uncomfortable. Do you… what is a migraine, exactly? I never really understood what he had.
DOCTOR: A migraine is a type of headache that can cause severe throbbing pain or pulsing sensations, usually on one side of the head. They can be accompanied by nausea, vomiting, and extreme sensitivity to light and sound. Your brother’s sounds like a classic case. As for your headaches, you said they're milder, with some nausea. Do they occur frequently?
PATIENT: Oh, no, not frequently, thank goodness. Maybe once or twice a month, if that. And they don't last very long, usually just a few hours. I usually take a little something over the counter and it helps. Aspirin, I think. It’s hard to keep track. I mostly wanted to come in because my daughter was so worried about the weakness. She’s a good girl, always looking out for me. Is the weakness… something serious, Doctor? I don't want to be a bother.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, intermittent weakness on the right side, headaches a couple of times a month, generally mild and responsive to over-the-counter aspirin. Now, Ms. Tofani, to get a clearer picture, I'd like to do a brief physical exam. Just a quick neurological assessment to check your reflexes, strength, and coordination. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I just want to make sure everything is alright. My daughter will be so relieved. Just tell me what to do. I hope I don’t mess anything up… I’m not very good at remembering instructions these days.
DOCTOR: Don't worry at all. I'll explain everything as we go. First, let’s just have you sit comfortably in the chair. Now, can you tell me your date of birth, just to confirm everything in the system?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness… let me see… it’s… August 14th, 1942. Yes, that’s right. 1942. It feels like a long time ago! I always remember the year because… well, never mind. It’s not important. Just August 14th, 1942. I hope I got that right. Sometimes the dates… they all run together.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Tofani. That’s perfect. Now, I'm going to check your blood pressure. 140/85. A little elevated, but not overly concerning. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes in your arms and legs. Can you relax your arms for me?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Relax… that's what my husband always tells me when I'm fussing over something. Relax. I hope I don’t flinch. My hands sometimes get a little shaky when I’m nervous. And I do get cold easily, so my arms are probably a bit chilly. Is that going to matter?
DOCTOR: Reflexes are a little diminished on the right side, but not dramatically so. Now, let's try squeezing my hands. Squeeze as hard as you can. Grip strength is slightly weaker on the right side as well. Now, I'm going to ask you to close your eyes and touch your nose with your finger. And now, touch my finger with your finger. Okay.
PATIENT: Oh dear… I’m sorry, Doctor. Is that bad? I knew I wasn’t very good at these things. It feels a little… clumsy, trying to reach. And my hand feels… heavy. Like I said, it's not constant, but it’s definitely more difficult on this side. I hope it’s not anything serious. I really don’t want to worry my daughter any more than I already have.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Tofani. Based on what you've told me and the brief exam, there are some findings that warrant further investigation. The slight weakness on your right side, coupled with the diminished reflexes and difficulty with coordination, could indicate a neurological issue. It's too early to say definitively what's going on, but we need to rule out a few possibilities. I’m going to order an MRI of your brain to get a clearer picture. We’ll also do some blood work to check for any underlying conditions.
PATIENT: Oh… an MRI? Is that… is that serious, Doctor? I've never had one before. And blood work… I don’t like needles. Is it going to hurt? I just hope it’s not something too awful. My daughter… she'll be so worried. What are you thinking it could be? I know you don’t want to scare me, but… I’d rather know. Even if it’s bad news.
DOCTOR: Ms. Tofani, it’s important to remember that these tests are just to gather information. An MRI will help us visualize your brain and identify any potential causes for your symptoms. The possibilities range from something relatively minor to something more significant. It could be a small stroke, a blockage in a blood vessel, or something else entirely. I don't want to jump to conclusions without seeing the results. As for the MRI itself, it's a painless procedure, although it does involve lying still in a loud machine for about 30-45 minutes. The blood work will involve a small needle prick, but it’s usually over quickly. I’m going to order these tests and schedule a follow-up appointment for us to discuss the results in a week. In the meantime, if you experience any sudden worsening of your symptoms—such as severe headache, difficulty speaking, or weakness that spreads—please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Oh… a week? That feels like a long time to wait. But… okay. Sudden worsening… I’ll remember that. My daughter will be relieved to know we're doing something. She always says I should get things checked out right away. Loud machine… I don't think I'll like that. But… if it helps, I’ll do it. So… I just have to wait, and then come back in a week? And if anything gets worse, go to the emergency room. You’re very kind, Doctor. I appreciate you explaining everything so carefully. It’s just… worrying. It always comes back to worrying.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Tofani. I understand your anxiety, and it's perfectly normal to be worried. We'll take things one step at a time. My staff will schedule the MRI and blood work for you, and they'll also arrange the follow-up appointment. They'll give you all the necessary instructions. In the meantime, try to rest and avoid any strenuous activity. Do you have any questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: Oh… no, I don't think so. You've explained everything very clearly. Just… the waiting, I suppose. And the loud machine. But I’ll manage. My daughter will be here to help. Thank you, Doctor Korrell. You've been very patient with an old woman who can’t remember things very well. I think that’s all. Just… waiting. .
DOCTOR: You're most welcome, Ms. Tofani. Don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your appointments. And please, try not to worry too much. We’ll get to the bottom of this. My staff will escort you to the scheduling desk. Have a good day, and I’ll see you in a week.
