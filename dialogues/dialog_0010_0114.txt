DOCTOR: Good morning, Maribeth. I’m Dr. Annesley. Welcome to the clinic. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. It’s…well, it’s my breathing. It’s been troubling me. I have trouble when I try to lie flat. It feels like I can’t get enough air.
DOCTOR: Okay, trouble breathing and worse when lying flat. That's good information to start with. Can you tell me more about when this started?
PATIENT: Hmm…let me think. It wasn't sudden, not exactly. Perhaps…three months ago? It started slowly, just noticing it more and more. At first, I just used an extra pillow, but now…even two pillows aren’t enough. It’s gotten worse over the last month, I’d say.
DOCTOR: Alright, three months gradual onset, worsening over the last month, requiring more pillows. And is it just when lying flat, or does it bother you at other times – like walking around, or sitting up?
PATIENT: No, it’s mostly when I lie down. When I’m up and about, I don’t have any trouble. Sitting is fine too. It’s just when I try to get comfortable in bed. It’s very…unsettling. I used to enjoy reading before bed, but now I dread it.
DOCTOR: Okay. So, exertional breathlessness is not present. Just positional. And you mentioned “unsettling.” Can you describe what feels unsettling about it?
PATIENT: Well, it’s…a tightness. In my chest, mostly. Like something is pressing on me. And sometimes, I feel a little…fluttering. Not a fast beat, but…a sort of shaky feeling. It’s hard to explain. It makes me anxious, if that makes sense. I don't like feeling like I can’t breathe.
DOCTOR: It does make sense. Tightness in the chest and a fluttering sensation with the positional breathing difficulty. Anxiety is understandable in that situation. Have you had any cough with this, Maribeth?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, no cough at all. Not a single one. That's why I thought it was…different. Usually when you have trouble breathing, you cough, don't you? This is just…air hunger, I suppose. And the tightness. It’s a peculiar feeling.
DOCTOR: You are right to note the absence of a cough; that is helpful. Air hunger and tightness are good descriptors. Let’s go through some other things. Do you have any swelling in your ankles or legs?
PATIENT: Swelling? No, not that I've noticed. I check them sometimes, you know, just to be sure. My ankles are…well, they look normal. I wear sensible shoes, always. No swelling, Doctor. Definitely not.
DOCTOR: Good. No lower extremity edema. Have you had any fevers, chills, or night sweats recently?
PATIENT: No, none of those. I haven't been sick at all. Not a fever, not a chill, no sweating at night. I sleep quite soundly, actually, even with this breathing trouble. It’s just…when I go to lie down. It’s a constant worry, to be honest. But no other symptoms like those you mentioned.
DOCTOR: Okay. No fever, chills, or night sweats. Now, I'd like to ask about your medical history, if you don't mind. Have you been diagnosed with any conditions, like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Let me see… High blood pressure, yes, years ago. The doctor put me on a pill, but I didn’t like the way it made me feel, so I stopped taking it. I haven’t been back to a doctor regularly since my divorce. No diabetes, no…heart problems that I know of. Just the blood pressure, and I haven’t had it checked in…well, a long time. I don’t believe I’ve ever had anything serious, to be truthful.
DOCTOR: Alright. History of hypertension, off medication. And no known diabetes or heart conditions. Do you know what your blood pressure was when you were diagnosed?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, no, I do not. The doctor just said it was high and gave me a pill. I wasn’t one for asking a lot of questions back then. I just wanted to feel better. I don't recall the numbers, I'm afraid. It was…many years ago. I haven't thought about it much since. I just stopped taking the medicine when it upset my stomach.
DOCTOR: Okay, no recollection of specific blood pressure readings. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Let me think… No surgeries, no. And no hospital stays. I broke my wrist when I was a child, but that’s the only time I’ve ever been in a hospital. It wasn’t a serious break. Just a cast for a few weeks. Nothing like a major operation or anything. I've been very fortunate, health-wise, until this breathing trouble, of course.
DOCTOR: Okay. No significant surgical history or hospitalizations. Let's talk about your family. Is there anyone in your family with heart disease, lung problems, or blood clots?
PATIENT: Hmm... My mother had a weak heart, I believe. She was always tired and short of breath, but she didn't go to the doctor much either. And my brother had some trouble with his legs, swelling, I think, but I don't know what it was. Other than that... not that I recall. My father was very healthy, lived to be 85, but he was a stubborn man and didn’t believe in doctors. It’s a family trait, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Alright, family history of possible heart disease in mother, possible leg issues in brother. Now, can you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Well, I live alone. I keep busy with my books, mostly. And I do a little gardening when the weather is nice. I don't smoke, never have. I used to drink a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, but I’ve cut back on that lately. I try to eat healthy, mostly fruits and vegetables. I walk a little, but not much. I haven't been very active since my husband passed. It just…takes the energy out of you.
DOCTOR: Okay, non-smoker, minimal alcohol, relatively healthy diet, limited activity. Now, one last thing before the exam. Are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or herbal supplements?
PATIENT: Just a multivitamin, Doctor. One every morning with my breakfast. And sometimes, when my arthritis flares up, I take ibuprofen. But that’s it. Nothing else. No herbal remedies, no prescription medicines. Just the multivitamin and the ibuprofen when I need it. I try to avoid taking too many pills, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright, multivitamin and ibuprofen as needed. Thank you for that thorough history, Maribeth. Now, I'd like to listen to your heart and lungs, and I’ll take your blood pressure. Then we can discuss a plan. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly fine. Please do. I'm eager to find out what's causing this trouble. And thank you for listening so patiently. It’s a relief to finally be talking to someone about it.
DOCTOR: Of course, Maribeth. That’s what I’m here for. If you could just lie back on the examination table, please. I’m going to start with your blood pressure, and then listen to your heart and lungs. It may be a little chilly, so let me know if you'd like a blanket. Alright, your blood pressure is a little elevated today. Now, let me listen to your heart and lungs. Take deep breaths for me, please. Okay. I'm hearing some faint crackles in your lungs, and your heart is beating a little faster than usual. It doesn't sound like anything immediately alarming, but it is something we need to investigate further.
PATIENT: Oh dear. Crackles, you say? Is that bad, Doctor? Is it my heart? I haven't been feeling any chest pain, if that helps. Just the difficulty breathing when I lie down. And now you’re saying my blood pressure is high too? It all sounds rather… worrying. What do you think is going on?
DOCTOR: It’s understandable that you’re worried, Maribeth. Let's break this down. The crackles in your lungs can indicate fluid buildup, but it's important not to jump to conclusions. High blood pressure can certainly contribute to this, and that’s why it’s good we checked it. The fact that you’re not experiencing chest pain is reassuring, but it doesn’t rule anything out. Based on what you’ve told me, and what I've found during the exam, I suspect we need to rule out a few possibilities. The most likely scenario is heart failure – where your heart isn't pumping as efficiently as it should, leading to fluid buildup in your lungs. However, it could also be a lung condition, like pneumonia, though that’s less likely given the lack of fever. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order a few tests. First, a chest X-ray to see how much fluid is in your lungs. And then, an electrocardiogram to check your heart’s electrical activity. We’ll also need some blood work to assess your kidney function and check for other potential causes. Would you be able to get those tests done this week?
PATIENT: Oh my. Heart failure? That sounds…serious, Doctor. I haven't felt sick, not really. Just tired, and short of breath. And all this talk of fluid…it’s all a bit overwhelming. Yes, I suppose I can get the tests done. Where would I go? And… how long will it take to get the results? I’m not good with hospitals, you know. I haven't been to one in years. I just want to know what’s going on and get it fixed, if possible. Is it a painful process? I do hope it’s not too involved.
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety, Maribeth. It’s natural to feel overwhelmed when facing the unknown. Let’s take this one step at a time. The tests are relatively simple and not painful at all. For the chest X-ray, you’ll simply stand in front of a machine for a few seconds while it takes a picture of your lungs. You won’t feel anything. The ECG involves placing small stickers on your chest, arms, and legs to measure your heart's electrical activity. It takes only a few minutes. The blood work involves a simple blood draw. You can go to St. Luke’s Hospital – it’s the closest facility. I’ll give you a written order for the tests. They should be able to schedule you for them this week. The results usually take 24-48 hours to come back. Once I have those, we can discuss them and determine the best course of action. Now, while we’re waiting for the results, I’m going to prescribe you a diuretic – a water pill – to help reduce some of the fluid buildup. It’s a low dose, and it should help you breathe easier. It's important to take it as directed. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No allergies, Doctor. None that I know of. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything. A diuretic, you say? Will that make me have to…go to the bathroom a lot? I do have a long drive home, and I don’t want to have any…unfortunate incidents. And if it’s heart failure, what does that mean exactly? Will I need to be hospitalized? I truly dread the thought of that. I just want to get back to my books, you know?
DOCTOR: That's a valid concern about the diuretic. Yes, it will make you urinate more frequently, especially in the beginning. That’s how it helps remove the excess fluid. I'm prescribing a low dose to minimize that effect. Try not to drink too much fluid before going to bed, and plan for a few extra bathroom breaks on your drive home. As for heart failure, it doesn’t necessarily mean your heart is stopping. It simply means it’s not pumping as efficiently as it should, which can cause fluid to build up in your lungs and other parts of your body. It’s a manageable condition, and there are many treatments available. Whether or not you’ll need to be hospitalized depends on the severity of the condition and how you respond to treatment. We’ll monitor your condition closely, and if your symptoms worsen, or you experience any chest pain or difficulty breathing, we’ll need to consider hospitalization. But let’s not get ahead of ourselves. We’ll take things one step at a time, and I’m confident we can get this under control. Here’s the prescription for the diuretic, called furosemide. Take one tablet every morning with breakfast. And here’s the order for the chest X-ray and ECG. Do you have any questions about the medications or tests before we proceed?
PATIENT: Furosemide… I’ll try to remember that. One tablet with breakfast. And…no drinking too much before the drive. It sounds…complicated. No, I don't think so. You've explained everything very clearly, Doctor. I appreciate your patience. It’s just…a lot to take in. I suppose I’ll just go home and try to relax, and get the tests done as soon as possible. And I’ll try not to worry too much. Thank you for seeing me today. You’ve put my mind at ease…somewhat. Hopefully, it’s nothing too serious. I just want to get back to my books, like I said. Is there anything else I should be aware of? Any symptoms I should watch out for? Before I forget…
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Maribeth. It's perfectly natural to feel overwhelmed, and I'm glad I could help ease your mind. Yes, there are a few symptoms to watch out for. If you experience any sudden chest pain, severe shortness of breath, swelling in your ankles or legs, or feel very weak or dizzy, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Also, if you notice any weight gain over a short period of time, let me know. That can be a sign of fluid buildup. Here's a list of those warning signs, just in case. And please, don't hesitate to call my office if you have any questions or concerns. We're here to help. I'm optimistic we'll get to the bottom of this, Maribeth. Try to relax, get some rest, and focus on getting the tests done. I look forward to seeing you again soon to discuss the results. Have a safe drive home, and take care.
