DOCTOR: Right, Manuel Carlotta. Seventy years old... Okay. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Hmm? Oh. Yes. My wife… she wants… a baby. Maybe. We… talk about it. She is… much younger. I am… old. We want to know… is good idea? Is possible? I make… little things. Metal, plastic. Not babies!
DOCTOR: Right. A baby… at seventy. Well. That's… a question. Look, sir, with all due respect, this isn't exactly a common situation. I’m an internal medicine physician – I don't specialize in reproductive health. We need to consider a lot of factors. Your wife’s age is relevant, of course, but your health is… paramount. Tell me, have you had a recent physical?
PATIENT: Physical? Oh… yes. I think so. Long time ago. Maybe… two years? Doctor… not here. In… city. I feel… okay. Mostly. Sometimes… back hurts. And… forget things. Like… what I eat for breakfast! But strong for my age, I think. I still work with my hands. Little models. Very precise.
DOCTOR: Two years… alright. And you're experiencing some memory issues, you say?
PATIENT: Yes. Not… all the time. Just… little things. Names. Dates. Where I put my glasses! But I can still build! Very good at it. My wife… she says I worry too much. That's why she wants… a baby. She says it will make me happy. I want to make her happy.
DOCTOR: Look, sir, I understand you want to make your wife happy. That's admirable. But having a child at seventy… it's a significant undertaking, physically and emotionally. And frankly, your memory concerns are something we need to investigate before even considering this. I’m going to need to do a full assessment. Let’s start with a physical exam. Blood pressure, heart rate, listen to your lungs... the usual. Then we'll talk about some blood work to get a baseline. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmm… I don’t think so. Never had… bad reaction. Maybe… a little itchy sometimes with some creams. But nothing… serious. Blood work? Okay. If you think… is good idea. I trust you, Doctor. Just… want to be sure. Is possible? That’s all.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's start with the physical. Blood work will give us a clearer picture. Now, if you don't mind, could you please lie back on the examination table?
PATIENT: Okay. Table… yes. Little cold, this table. But… okay. You tell me what to do, Doctor. I am ready. Just… a little nervous. Is long time since… checkup.
DOCTOR: Alright. Just relax. Deep breaths. Good. Heart sounds… a little murmur, but not particularly concerning for someone your age. Blood pressure is… elevated. 140 over 90. We'll need to monitor that. Lungs are clear. Now, let’s check your reflexes. Hmm. A little diminished, but within expected range. Now, I'm going to take a look in your ears and throat. Open wide and say “ah.”
PATIENT: “Ah…” Throat… feels a little dry. And… I think I have a small cough. Sometimes. Especially… in the morning. Not bad cough. Just… tickle. My wife… she makes very good tea. Helps the cough. Ginger and lemon. Very good.
DOCTOR: Alright. A little redness, but nothing alarming. Could be from the dry air or a mild irritation. Now, I’m going to palpate your abdomen. Just let me know if anything feels tender. Any pain here?
PATIENT: No pain. Ooh… just there… a little sore. Sometimes. When I… eat too much. Or… bend over. Old… gets sore easily. I used to be very strong. Lift heavy things. Build big models. Now… little models. Easier on my back.
DOCTOR: Alright. That could be a musculoskeletal issue – something we can look into further. Now, before we proceed, I need to ask a few more questions about your medical history. Have you ever been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Hospital…? Hmm… Long time ago. When I was… young man. Broken leg. Playing football. Very foolish. And… when my wife was born. But that… not sick. Just… baby hospital. Many years ago. No… nothing else. Never been… seriously sick. Just… little things. Colds. Flu. Oh! And… appendicitis. When I was… maybe thirty? They… cut me open. But I got better. Very good doctor.
DOCTOR: Broken leg, appendicitis… alright. And have you had any surgeries besides your appendectomy?
PATIENT: Surgeries…? Let me think… No. I don't think so. Maybe… small things. Skin tags. But nothing… big. Like… cutting me open. Just… little snips. My wife… she takes care of my skin. Says I need to look nice. For… the baby. She is very hopeful.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about medications?
PATIENT: Medications…? Oh. Just… little pills. For my back. Sometimes. When it… really hurts. And… vitamin D. The doctor… said I need more sunshine. But I don’t go out much. My wife buys them. She remembers everything. I forget the names. Little blue pills. And… white ones. For the back.
DOCTOR: Alright. Vitamin D and something for back pain. Do you know the dosages of those medications?
PATIENT: Dosages…? No. I don’t know. She… fills the bottles. Tells me how many. I just… take them. She says… “Take two of the blue ones, Manuel.” Or… “One white one after dinner.” I trust her. She is very… careful. I don’t like… remembering pills. Makes my head hurt.
DOCTOR: Alright. We’ll need to get a full list of your medications from your wife. This is important. Now, let's talk about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family history…? Hmm… My father… he had… problems with his heart. Old age. He… just got weak. And… my mother… she had… diabetes. Sugar problem. She… needed pills. Like… my mother. And… my brother… he had… cancer. Long time ago. Very sad. He… didn’t get better. Not much… good health in my family.
DOCTOR: Alright. Heart problems, diabetes, and cancer in the family. This is all important information. Now, tell me about your social history. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: Smoke? Oh no. Never. My wife… she would be very angry. And… bad for health. Very bad. I like… tea. And… little biscuits. Sometimes. She makes very good biscuits.
DOCTOR: Alright. No smoking. Do you drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Alcohol…? Sometimes. Very little. Maybe… a small glass of wine. With dinner. On… special occasions. My wife… she likes a little wine too. Very small glass. We… celebrate sometimes. But not much. Mostly… tea. She is the one who drinks the wine. I prefer tea.
DOCTOR: Alright. Very occasional alcohol use. Now, one final question before we get to ordering some tests. Are you currently sexually active?
PATIENT: Oh… Well… yes. Sometimes. Not… every day. Old… not so strong anymore. But… we still… hold hands. And… be close. My wife… she is very loving. Is that… okay? For the baby?
DOCTOR: Alright. Thank you for being honest with me. Okay, sir, we've covered a lot of ground. Based on what you've told me, and your age, I want to order some blood work. It will check your overall health, your kidney and liver function, your blood sugar levels, and some hormone levels. We also need to do a urine analysis. And, I’m going to refer you to a cardiologist for a heart evaluation, given your family history and the murmur I detected. Finally, I'd like to see your wife, so we can get a complete list of your medications and discuss this further. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes… that sounds… okay. Lots of tests. But… if it will help. And… if it will help us have a baby. My wife… she will be very happy. She can… bring the list. And… come with me. She is very good at… remembering things. I just hope… the tests are not too bad. Old… gets tired easily.
DOCTOR: I understand. We'll take things at your pace. We'll start with the blood work and urine analysis. The lab is just down the hall. I'll have the nurse draw the samples. Then we'll schedule the cardiology appointment. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Questions…? Hmm… Is… is it possible? For a baby? At my age? Is it… safe? For my wife? And… for the baby? I just… want to be sure. I don't want to… cause any problems.
DOCTOR: Sir, having a child at seventy is… high-risk. It’s not impossible, but there are significant medical considerations for both you and your wife, and potential risks to the baby. The blood work and cardiology evaluation are crucial to determining if you're physically fit enough to even consider this. We need to assess your overall health, your heart function, and your hormone levels. We’ll also need to discuss the risks of pregnancy at your wife's age, and potential complications. I’m not going to give you a definitive answer right now. We need more information. We’ll do the tests, and then we’ll have a frank discussion about the pros and cons. Does that sound fair?
PATIENT: Fair… yes. That sounds… fair. I just… want to know the truth. Whatever it is. If it’s not possible… I need to know. If it’s too risky… I need to know. I trust you, Doctor. You tell us… what is best. For my wife… and… for the baby. Let’s do the tests. Where… where do we go? For the tests?
DOCTOR: Alright. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood. She will also collect a urine sample. The lab is just down the hall to the left. Once that's done, we'll schedule your cardiology appointment. I will see you both in a week to discuss the results. In the meantime, please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. Do you have any further questions for me right now before we proceed?
PATIENT: No… I think… that’s all. Thank you, Doctor. For… being honest. And… for taking the time. I just… hope for good news.
DOCTOR: You’re welcome, sir. We'll do everything we can. I will let the nurse know you're ready. Please take your time and rest.
