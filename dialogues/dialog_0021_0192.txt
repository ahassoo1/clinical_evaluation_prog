DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Hartness. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Right. Well, it's for the… the army thing. The test. Gotta get it done, you see. Before I… well, before I sign up. It's a requirement, I think. They want to make sure I'm not falling apart, or something. Not that I think I am.
DOCTOR: Right. The army physical… yes, yes. A sensible precaution, I suppose. Though honestly, most of them don’t send the best specimens my way. Just trying to tick boxes, usually. So, tell me, what specifically are you concerned about?
PATIENT: Concerned? Nothing’s wrong. I just… I want to be sure everything’s alright. For the test, you understand. I’ve always been strong. Worked with engines all my life. Lots of lifting, bending, that sort of thing. Never had any problems. But they ask all these questions… about family history and… and feelings. Feels a bit silly, if you ask me. What’s that got to do with being able to take orders?
DOCTOR: Well, Mr. Hartness, while physical strength is important, the army does want to make sure you're… comprehensively fit. Family history can indicate predispositions to certain conditions, and they ask about… 'feelings' – as you put it – to assess your mental resilience. It’s… bureaucratic, certainly. But we have to cover all bases. Let's start with you. Any major illnesses or injuries you've had?
PATIENT: Illnesses? Not really. Had the flu a few times, like everyone does. Broke my wrist when I was a teenager, climbing a tree. Stupid, really. Healed up fine though. Been perfectly healthy since. Strong as an ox, I tell ya. Never been one for sitting around feeling sorry for myself. Don’t believe in it. What kind of conditions are we talking about anyway? Sounds like a lot of fuss over nothing, if you ask me.
DOCTOR: Well, we're looking for things like heart conditions, diabetes, asthma... anything that might be exacerbated by strenuous activity. Or predispositions to them, inherited from your family. It’s not about whether you feel strong, Mr. Hartness, it's about ruling things out. Let’s talk family. Anyone in your family had any of those issues?
PATIENT: Heart trouble… Hmm. My father… he had a bit of a cough near the end. Old age, mostly. Smoked too much, always said that’s what did him in. Not a proper heart condition, I don’t think. And my mother… she was fine. Never a day's illness in her life. Stubborn woman, she was. Wouldn't even go to the doctor when she needed to. Diabetes? Not that I know of. None of us are the type to… worry about things. We just get on with it. It's all a bit silly, really. Asking about feelings and coughs… What exactly are you trying to find out?
DOCTOR: Right. So, father with a history of smoking-related cough, mother with… admirable stoicism. That’s… helpful, in a limited way. We're trying to assess your overall risk profile, Mr. Hartness. It’s not about judging your family's lifestyle choices, it's about ensuring you're safe for a physically demanding role. Now, how about you?
PATIENT: Safe? I am safe. Always have been. Look, I fix engines for a living. It's not exactly a desk job, you know. I’m on my feet all day, lifting heavy parts, crawling under things. I'm perfectly capable. I don't smoke, don't drink much, and I eat… well, I eat what my wife cooks. That’s probably healthy enough. What else do you need to know? Are you going to ask about my childhood now? This is ridiculous.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. No need to get agitated, Mr. Hartness. Just trying to gather information. So, no major medical issues, active lifestyle, healthy diet… That’s good. We'll do a quick physical exam, just to confirm what you've told me. Blood pressure, pulse, listen to your heart and lungs, check your reflexes… routine things. Then we can discuss the results. Sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Fine. Get on with it then. The sooner this is over, the better. I’ve got things to do, you know. Engines don’t fix themselves. And my wife’s expecting me home for dinner. Just… don't take too long. And please, no asking about my feelings again. It's… undignified.
DOCTOR: Very well. If you'll just step onto the table… and please remove your shirt. I'll start with your blood pressure. And, I assure you, I won't delve into your emotional state unless absolutely necessary. Although, a certain level of self-awareness is helpful in assessing suitability for demanding roles… but we won't dwell on that now.
