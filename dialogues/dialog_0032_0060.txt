DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Theriot. My name is Dr. Pipkorn. It’s a pleasure to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, good morning to you too, Doctor. Honestly? It’s probably nothing, but my family… we have a history. Lots of… things. My aunt died young, my grandfather wasn’t right in the head towards the end, and my mother… well, let’s just say she’s not as sharp as she used to be. I just want to make sure I don’t end up the same way. You know, peace of mind, really. I'm a teacher, I need to be on my game.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Theriot. Family history is important, and it's wise to be proactive. While I appreciate you being forthcoming, “things” and “not right in the head” aren’t particularly helpful for a medical assessment. Could you be a bit more specific about what your aunt’s cause of death was, and what you observed with your grandfather and mother?
PATIENT: Ugh, see? This is what I mean. Everyone wants specifics. I don’t have specifics. My aunt… heart attack, I think? It was quick. And my grandfather… he just… forgot things. A lot of things. Got confused easily. Kept repeating himself. Eventually, he needed full-time care. As for my mother… she misplaces everything. She'll start a sentence and then… lose track of what she was saying. It's frustrating, mostly. And it’s making me anxious. I’m trying to be prepared, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright. A heart attack in your aunt, progressive memory loss in your grandfather, and now some cognitive difficulties in your mother. That gives us something to work with, though a more detailed history would be beneficial. “Cognitive difficulties” is rather broad. Can you describe what you've personally observed with your mother?
PATIENT: Well, like, yesterday she was making tea and put the kettle in the fridge. The fridge, Doctor. And then she was asking me what my wife’s name was. We’ve been married for five years. She just… blanked. It happens more and more often, little things, but they’re adding up. It’s not like she’s totally out of it, she still knows who I am, but… it’s worrying. Honestly, sometimes she gets really frustrated with herself, which is almost worse than if she didn’t realize it.
DOCTOR: I see. Putting the kettle in the fridge is… unusual, and forgetting your wife’s name after five years of marriage is certainly concerning. The awareness of her own deficits, as you describe, is… noteworthy. Now, let's focus on you, Mr. Theriot. Have you experienced any memory problems, difficulty concentrating, or changes in your mood or behavior?
PATIENT: No, not really. I mean, I forget where I put my keys sometimes, who doesn't? But nothing… significant. I'm a little stressed, probably because of all this family stuff, but I sleep okay. I’m a pretty organized person, generally. I keep things in order. I need to be, for my job. I’m a teacher, I have to remember a lot of names and dates and… curriculum. So, no, I haven't noticed anything wrong with myself. I’m just trying to get ahead of things, you know? Preventative measures.
DOCTOR: Very well. It's good that you're not experiencing any noticeable cognitive decline yourself at this time. However, given your family history, I think it would be prudent to perform a brief cognitive assessment. It’s a standard test – nothing to be alarmed about – just a series of questions and tasks to assess your memory and attention. Would you be willing to proceed?
PATIENT: A test? Look, I told you, I'm fine. I'm a perfectly capable adult. I don't need a test to tell me I'm functioning normally. I’m a teacher, Doctor. I deal with tests all the time. It feels… condescending, frankly. I came here for reassurance, not to be treated like… like I’m already losing my mind.
DOCTOR: Mr. Theriot, I understand your frustration, however, my suggestion is not based on any assumption that you are experiencing cognitive difficulties. It is simply a precautionary measure, given your strong family history of neurodegenerative conditions. It's akin to getting a cholesterol check even if you feel perfectly healthy. It provides a baseline. However, if you are truly opposed to a cognitive assessment, I respect your decision. In that case, we can focus on lifestyle modifications to promote brain health. Regular exercise, a healthy diet, and adequate sleep are all crucial. But I strongly advise you reconsider the assessment, as it would provide valuable information. Do you have any other concerns I can address at this time?
PATIENT: Fine. Fine. But don’t expect me to be thrilled about it. And please, keep it brief. I have things to do. I’m not trying to spend the whole day here getting quizzed. And honestly, if it's just going to be basic memory stuff, I'm not sure what good it'll do. I remember my lesson plans perfectly well, thank you very much.
DOCTOR: Very well. It will be a brief assessment, approximately fifteen to twenty minutes. It will involve memory recall, but also tests of attention, language, and spatial orientation. It’s designed to be sensitive enough to detect subtle changes. I assure you, it's not a comprehensive neurological exam. I’ll explain each part as we go along. Let's begin with a simple recall task. I’m going to say three words, and I want you to repeat them back to me. Try to remember them, as I will ask you to recall them later. Are you ready?
PATIENT: Yes, let's just get it over with. Go ahead.
DOCTOR: The three words are: apple, table, penny. Please repeat them back to me.
PATIENT: Apple… table… penny. There. Happy?
DOCTOR: Excellent. Now, I’m going to ask you a series of questions about your current date and location. What is today’s date, including the year?
PATIENT: It's August 2nd… 2025. Honestly, Doctor, is this really necessary? It feels… patronizing.
DOCTOR: It is a standard component of the assessment, Mr. Theriot. And yes, it is necessary. Now, can you tell me what city and state we are currently in?
PATIENT: Look, I came here because I'm worried about my family history, not to be interrogated on basic facts. This is ridiculous. Fine, it's… I’m in… suburban… wherever this place is. I didn’t ask where we were when I booked the appointment. It’s a doctor's office, obviously.
DOCTOR: Mr. Theriot, I understand your frustration, but your inability to state the city and state – information readily available to you – is concerning. And it is relevant to the assessment. I was hoping to avoid this, but I believe a referral to a neurologist for a more comprehensive evaluation is warranted. This assessment, while not definitive, raises enough red flags that I cannot, in good conscience, simply dismiss your concerns without further investigation. I can provide you with a list of specialists in the area. Would you like me to do that?
