DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Carlotta. I'm Dr. Alzoubi. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Hmm… my wife… she wants… a baby. We… want to make sure everything is okay. Old man like me… need check, yes? I forget things… so maybe need help to remember how to… start. It's been a long time.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. You and your wife are thinking about trying for a baby, and you'd like to make sure you're healthy enough and address any concerns given it's been some time. That's very responsible of you both. Let's start with a bit of your medical history. Do you have any current medical conditions – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, heart problems, or anything else your doctors have told you about?
PATIENT: Hmm… doctor… lots of doctors over years. I think… maybe high blood pressure, long time ago. They gave me… little pills. Stopped taking them… felt okay after. And… back pain. Old man back. Not… serious. I go to physical therapy sometimes. But… nothing else, I think. I forget! My wife knows better. She keeps the papers.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. It’s good you had physical therapy for your back. And it’s good you're aware of the past blood pressure issue, even if you’re not currently taking medication. We'll need to check that today. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. No… I don’t think so. Nothing bad. Maybe… sometimes a little itchy after I eat shellfish. Not… serious itchy. Just… a little. My wife says I should not eat so much, but… I like shellfish! Not a real allergy, I think. Just… old man stomach.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a possible mild reaction to shellfish, not a severe allergy. We’ll make a note of that. And we’ll keep that in mind. Now, let's talk about medications. Are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter pills, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Let me see… Ah! Yes. I take… a little pill for my… water. The doctor said my water was not… strong. It helps me… go to the bathroom. And… sometimes, when my back hurts, I take a little pain pill. Just when it is really bad. Not every day, no. Just… sometimes. I think that is all. Maybe a vitamin D… my wife gives it to me. For the bones. Old man bones.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a medication for your bladder, a pain pill as needed for your back, and vitamin D. Do you know the names of the medication for your bladder and the pain pill?
PATIENT: Names… oh dear. No… I don’t remember. Little white pills. And… the pain pill is… yellow, I think. Small yellow pill. I give them to my wife… she knows the names. She keeps everything very organized. I am not good with names… or remembering things. Sorry, Doctor.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Mr. Carlotta. It’s very common to forget medication names. We can look up your medications if you give me your wife’s name and date of birth; that way, we can get accurate records. And while we’re at it, have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Yes… one surgery. Long, long ago. When I was young man… very foolish. I fell… working with metal. Broke my arm. They fixed it. Everything okay now. Just… a little stiff sometimes when it is cold. That is all. My wife always reminds me to wear a sweater. Very good wife.
DOCTOR: Okay, a previous surgery to fix a broken arm. Good to know. Now, just a few more questions about your background. Could you tell me about your family history?
PATIENT: Family… hmm. Long family in Somalia. Many brothers and sisters. Most still there, I think. Hard to know now. My father… strong man. My mother… very kind. No… no one sick. No heart trouble, no… cancer. Everyone lived long time. But… it's a long way away. Hard to remember details. We don't talk much about it now. It makes my wife sad. She misses home.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. No major known medical issues in your family, as far as you know. Now, let's talk a little bit about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No! No smoking. Never smoke. Bad for health. And… no alcohol. Not much. Sometimes… small glass of wine with dinner. But very little. And… no drugs! Never. Old man like me… just want good health for my wife and… maybe a baby. Not good things, those… smoking and drugs. Very bad.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear, Mr. Carlotta. Maintaining good health is important. Okay, that gives me a good overview of your history. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, just to check your overall health and make sure everything is working as it should. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That is good. Whatever you need. I trust you. I want to be sure… everything is okay. For the baby. And my wife. She is very worried. Old man like me… need to be strong. Please, do what you need to do.
DOCTOR: Wonderful. Alright, let’s start with your blood pressure. Could you please take off your shoes and socks?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Here you go. It's a little cold in here, isn’t it? I should have worn thicker socks. My wife always tells me…
DOCTOR: It is a little chilly. Now, just relax your arm… and take a few deep breaths. Okay, your blood pressure is 142/88. That’s a little elevated, but not dramatically so. We’ll want to keep an eye on that. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Now, let’s take a look at your ears…
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgement. My wife says I should listen to the doctor… always. Old man like me… need good advice. Is something wrong?
DOCTOR: Everything looks good in your ears. No signs of infection or wax buildup. Now, I'm just going to press on your stomach. Let me know if anything feels painful. No tenderness here. And finally, I’ll just check your reflexes. Reflexes are normal. Okay, overall, your physical exam is within normal limits, aside from the slightly elevated blood pressure. I'd like to order some blood work to get a more detailed look at your health. This will include a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a thyroid test. We'll also do a urine sample.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. That sounds good. Whatever tests you think is best. Blood work… urine… yes. I will do whatever you need. And… will we be able to… try for the baby soon? My wife is very eager. She worries about being too old. Old man like me… slowing down. We don't want to wait too long.
DOCTOR: That's a very reasonable concern, Mr. Carlotta. I understand your wife’s anxieties. The blood work and urine sample will give us a clearer picture of your overall health and help us determine if you're both ready to start trying for a baby. Here are the requisitions for the lab tests. You can go to the lab downstairs and they'll take the samples. They'll need a urine sample, so please try to collect one when you can. Once we have the results, we can discuss them in detail and determine the next steps. I would also recommend that your wife see her gynecologist for a check-up, to ensure she is in good health as well. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Hmm… no… I don’t think so. You explained everything very well. But… will the tests… be expensive? My wife and I… we don’t have much money. We are old… on fixed income. Will Medicare cover them? My wife worries about the bills. That is… her biggest worry, I think. More than the age. More than the tests. The money.
DOCTOR: That’s a very valid concern, Mr. Carlotta. Let me check with the billing department to see exactly what Medicare will cover for these tests. I can also see if there are any programs available to help with the costs. Okay, it looks like Medicare should cover most of these tests, but there might be a small co-pay. I’ll have the billing department contact your wife directly to discuss the specifics and any potential financial assistance options. In the meantime, I’m going to write a referral for a consultation with a urologist. This isn’t urgent, but it’s a good idea to get a specialist’s opinion, especially given your desire to start a family. They can evaluate your overall reproductive health and address any potential concerns. Here’s the referral. Do you have any other questions before you go?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think that is everything. You have been very kind. And very helpful. My wife will be very happy. She always worries so much. Thank you. Thank you very much. I think… I will go downstairs now. And then… go home to my wife. Tell her the good news. Thank you again, Doctor Alzoubi. You have given us hope.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful to hear, Mr. Carlotta. It was my pleasure. Please don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. And best of luck to you and your wife. Have a good day.
