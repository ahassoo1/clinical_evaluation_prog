DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Purtee. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Abady. It’s a pleasure to meet you. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, it’s a little embarrassing, but I’ve noticed a change in my body odor. It’s… different. Not worse, exactly, just different than it usually is. I figured it was best to get it checked out, you know?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Purtee. It's very sensible of you to come in and have it evaluated. Changes in body odor can sometimes be a sign of an underlying issue, and it's always best to be proactive. To help me understand what’s going on, could you describe this difference in more detail?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. It's hard to explain. Usually, I just smell… like me, I guess? Kind of a natural scent. But lately, it's almost… sweeter? And maybe a little bit musky? It's not like BO, not exactly. It's… subtler, but definitely noticeable to me. I’ve been using the same deodorant for years, so it’s not that. I don’t think so, anyway.
DOCTOR: I understand. A subtle but noticeable change is still important to investigate. And you're right to rule out changes in your hygiene products. Now, have you noticed this change occurring gradually over time, or did it appear rather suddenly?
PATIENT: It started… maybe a month ago? I think it was after that heat wave we had. It wasn't super sudden, more like… I noticed it one day and thought, “That’s not quite right.” And then it’s just been… there. Not getting worse, just… consistent. Does that make sense? I’m terrible at describing things, I apologize.
DOCTOR: You’re describing it perfectly well, Ms. Purtee. Don’t apologize at all. A month ago, coinciding with the heat wave, is helpful information. Heat can sometimes exacerbate certain conditions. To get a better understanding, could you tell me if you've noticed any other changes alongside this altered body odor?
PATIENT: Let me think… Hmm. No, not really. I haven't felt sick or anything. No fever, no weight loss, no extra sweating besides the usual when it’s hot. My energy levels are normal. I did have a little bit of trouble sleeping last week, but that’s happened before, usually when I’m stressed. Nothing major. Oh! And my appetite has been a little lower, maybe? But I haven’t been tracking it or anything, just… not as hungry as usual.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Purtee. That’s helpful. Reduced appetite and occasional sleep disturbances are good to note. Now, let’s talk a bit about your medical history. Do you have any current medical conditions that you’re aware of?
PATIENT: Well, I have high blood pressure, but it's managed with medication. I take lisinopril, I think it’s called. And I had my gallbladder removed about ten years ago, but other than that… not much. I had the usual childhood illnesses, but nothing serious. Oh, and I’m allergic to penicillin. Really allergic. Breaks me out in hives. Does that cover it?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s very helpful, Ms. Purtee. High blood pressure managed with lisinopril, a history of gallbladder removal ten years ago, and a penicillin allergy – I've made a note of all of that. Now, regarding your family history – are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Let’s see… My mother had diabetes, type 2, I believe. And my father had heart disease, he had a stroke about five years before he passed. My brother is healthy as a horse, though. Nothing major on his side. My grandmother on my mother's side… she had dementia, but that was later in life. Is that what you were looking for?
DOCTOR: That is excellent information, Ms. Purtee. History of type 2 diabetes in your mother and heart disease in your father are important to be aware of. Now, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Sure. I work as a floor layer – not carpet, more like vinyl or tile. It’s pretty physical, lots of bending and kneeling. I’m on my feet all day. I don't smoke, and I rarely drink alcohol, maybe a glass of wine with dinner once or twice a month. I try to eat healthy, lots of vegetables, but sometimes it’s hard when I’m working and on the go. I don't really exercise regularly, I get enough movement at work, I guess. Does that give you a good picture?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s very helpful, Ms. Purtee. A physically demanding job, no smoking or heavy alcohol consumption, and a generally healthy diet are all good things. Now, just to be thorough, have you noticed any changes in your skin recently – any rashes, new moles, or unusual growths?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. My skin's been pretty normal, maybe a little dry in the winter, but that’s usual. I haven’t noticed any new moles or anything changing on me. I do try to wear sunscreen when I’m outside, especially with my work, but it’s hard to remember sometimes. I haven’t had any itching or anything like that either. Just… normal skin, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Purtee. That’s good to know. Now, I’d like to perform a brief physical exam, if you don't mind. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your skin. It will just be a quick assessment. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s perfectly fine. Go ahead, Doctor. I’m ready when you are. I appreciate you being so thorough. I’m a little nervous, but I figured it was better to get it checked out.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Purtee. It’s always best to be proactive about your health. Let’s start by checking your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is slightly elevated, but not dramatically so, given your history. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds are regular, and your lungs are clear. I didn't notice anything concerning during the skin exam. Now, I’m going to gently palpate your lymph nodes, just to check for any swelling. Your lymph nodes feel normal. Everything appears to be within normal limits, physically. Given your description of the change in body odor, and the fact that the physical exam is unremarkable, I’d like to order a few blood tests, just to rule out any underlying medical conditions. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good, Doctor. If that's what you think is best, then let’s do the blood tests. I want to get to the bottom of this, and I trust your judgment. What kind of tests are you thinking of? I hope they're not too… invasive? I'm a little squeamish, if I'm being honest.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Purtee. Nothing invasive at all, I assure you. Just a standard blood draw. I'd like to check a complete blood count , a comprehensive metabolic panel – that will check your kidney and liver function, blood sugar and electrolytes – and a thyroid-stimulating hormone level. We'll also check your hemoglobin A1c to get a picture of your average blood sugar over the past few months. These tests can help us rule out a variety of potential causes for the change in body odor. Do you have any questions about those tests?
PATIENT: No, that all sounds… reasonable. I don't think I have any questions, actually. You explained it all very clearly. So a regular blood draw, then? Is there anything I need to do to prepare for it? Like, should I fast beforehand or anything like that? I really don’t want to mess it up and have to come back again.
DOCTOR: Yes, a regular blood draw. And you are correct to ask about preparation! For the most accurate results with the CMP and A1c, I would recommend fasting for at least 8-12 hours beforehand. That means no food or sugary drinks, but you can still drink water. The CBC doesn’t require fasting, but it’s best to be consistent, so I’d recommend abstaining from food and sugary beverages during that time. I will provide you with a lab order and instructions for the blood draw. They will draw the blood here at the clinic. Do you have any known difficulties with blood draws, like fainting or a history of collapsing?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. I've had blood work done before, and I didn’t have any problems. I usually just look away. I get a little lightheaded sometimes, but nothing major. I think I’m okay. And thank you for asking. It's good to know you’re thinking of everything. I appreciate that. So, just no food for 8-12 hours. Got it.
DOCTOR: Excellent. And if you do start to feel lightheaded during the blood draw, please let the phlebotomist know immediately. They are trained to handle that. I will also send the lab order to the lab electronically so they are expecting you. Once the results are back – usually within a few days – we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms – such as fever, weight loss, excessive sweating, or any other concerning changes – please don't hesitate to contact the clinic. Do you have any questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. You’ve been very thorough and reassuring, Doctor. I feel a lot better knowing we’re checking things out. Thank you for taking the time to listen and explain everything so clearly. I really appreciate it. I'll schedule a follow up when the results are back.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Purtee. It was my pleasure. I understand your concern, and I’m glad I could address it. Remember, we're here to help. I will have the receptionist schedule your follow-up appointment as you leave. Have a good day, and please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns.
