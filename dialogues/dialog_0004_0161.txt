DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Trefren. I'm Dr. Deschane. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, to be honest, a friend suggested I come talk to you about… something to help prevent HIV. She said there's a pill you can take, even if you're not… you know… actively worried, just to be safe. That’s what I’m here about, I guess.
DOCTOR: I see. Preventative measures, proactively. Very well. Ms. Trefren, to be clear, you're asking about pre-exposure prophylaxis – PrEP – for HIV. It is a very effective medication, as your friend mentioned. However, it’s not simply a matter of starting a pill. We need to determine if you’re a suitable candidate and, frankly, understand why you feel this is necessary. First, let's talk about your risk factors. Can you elaborate on what prompted this conversation with your friend?
PATIENT: Risk factors… Honestly? I’m a little embarrassed to say. I’m… single, as you can see on the paperwork, and I do date. Sometimes casually. It’s just… you hear things, you read things. And my friend, she’s very cautious, and she just said it’s better to be safe than sorry. It’s not that I don’t trust people, but… well, you never really know, do you? I haven't had any… recent concerns, if that makes sense. Just a general worry.
DOCTOR: A general worry is a perfectly valid reason to inquire about preventative measures, Ms. Trefren. However, PrEP does have potential side effects and requires regular monitoring, so we need to be thorough. Let's review some pertinent medical history to ensure it’s appropriate for you. Have you ever been tested for HIV before?
PATIENT: Yes, I have. A couple of times, actually. Once, maybe five years ago, when I first started dating again after… well, a long time. And then again, maybe two years ago. Both times negative. I can give you the dates if you need them. My doctor… she keeps very good records. I think she’s still in practice, Dr. Amin, over on Elm Street.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Ms. Trefren. Knowing your previous negative status is important. And yes, please, if you can recall approximate dates, that would be helpful. Now, let's move on to other medical conditions. Do you have any chronic health problems, such as high blood pressure, diabetes, or kidney issues?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. I'm pretty healthy, actually, for my age. I walk a lot – my job keeps me moving, you know, being a parking attendant? And I try to eat well, mostly. Just… a little bit of a sweet tooth, that's my vice. My blood pressure is usually good, I get it checked with my yearly physical. Honestly, the biggest thing is just… getting enough sleep, sometimes. It's hard.
DOCTOR: Walking is excellent. And good to hear about your blood pressure. Your weight is a bit elevated, Ms. Trefren, but not significantly concerning at this point. Now, let’s talk about medications. Are you currently taking any prescription drugs, over-the-counter medications, or supplements?
PATIENT: Just vitamins, mostly. A daily multivitamin, and sometimes I take calcium. And occasionally, if I have a headache, I'll take ibuprofen. That's it. Really. Nothing regular, nothing for anything serious. Oh, and sometimes a little bit of melatonin to help with the sleep I mentioned. But that's not every night, just when I'm really struggling.
DOCTOR: Alright. No regular prescription medications, that's good. And you mentioned a sweet tooth… any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies, thankfully. Not to food, not to drugs, nothing like that. I'm pretty lucky in that regard. My mother always said I had a cast-iron stomach. She was a bit of a worrier too, so she always checked!
DOCTOR: A robust constitution is certainly advantageous, Ms. Trefren. Now, to complete the picture, let's briefly discuss your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – heart disease, diabetes, kidney problems, or any history of sexually transmitted infections?
PATIENT: Well, my father had heart disease, unfortunately. He passed away when he was in his seventies. And my mother had high blood pressure, like I said, she was a worrier. As for STIs… I don’t… I don't really know. We didn't talk much about those things growing up, if I'm honest. I don’t think anyone in my family ever openly discussed anything like that. It wasn't really the sort of thing we talked about.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Trefren. Family medical histories can be incomplete. Alright, before we proceed further, I'm going to need to do a brief physical examination. Specifically, I'll need to check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and do a quick exam to rule out any obvious signs of infection. It's standard procedure. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Perfectly acceptable. I figured you'd want to do some checking. Just… try not to make me lie on that paper table if you can? My back isn't what it used to be.
DOCTOR: I will do my best to accommodate that, Ms. Trefren. Please have a seat here on the exam stool. First, let’s take your blood pressure. Relax your arm, please. … 142 over 88. A bit elevated, as expected given your weight and recent stress. Heart sounds are regular, though slightly stronger than ideal. Lungs are clear. Now, I’m just going to briefly examine your skin for any unusual rashes or lesions. Please let me know if anything is tender. … No obvious signs of infection. Overall, your physical examination is unremarkable, though your blood pressure is something we will need to address regardless of whether you proceed with PrEP.
PATIENT: Okay, good. I'm glad it didn't find anything obvious. And yes, I know my blood pressure could be better, I've been meaning to talk to my doctor about it. So… what does this all mean? Am I a candidate for this pill? Should I… can I start it? I just want to be safe, you know? I don’t want to worry about all this every time I… go on a date.
DOCTOR: Ms. Trefren, based on your history and physical examination, you could be considered a candidate for PrEP. However, there are a few considerations. Your elevated blood pressure requires attention before starting PrEP, as some of the medications used can further impact blood pressure control. Furthermore, while you express a desire for preventative measures, your risk factors remain somewhat undefined. To proceed responsibly, I recommend a few further steps. First, a complete blood panel to assess your kidney function and overall health. Second, testing for any existing sexually transmitted infections. Third, I would like a referral to a cardiologist to evaluate your blood pressure and determine the best course of management. Until these steps are completed, I cannot responsibly prescribe PrEP. It would be… imprudent. I understand your concerns about safety, but simply taking a pill without addressing these underlying factors is not a solution.
PATIENT: Okay… that makes sense. That's… a lot, but it makes sense. I can do those things. Blood work, testing… a cardiologist. I suppose I should have expected that. It’s just… I was hoping for something simpler. So, what happens now? Do I schedule appointments? Do you have referrals for a cardiologist? And where do I go for the blood work and testing? I want to get this started, you know? As soon as possible.
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Trefren, you will need to schedule appointments. I have a list of cardiologists here who accept your Medicare insurance. Dr. El-Sayed is excellent, but has a longer wait time. Dr. Ramirez is accepting new patients with shorter wait times. For the blood work and STI testing, I will provide you with a lab requisition. You can go to Quest Diagnostics on Elm Street. They take Medicare and have convenient hours. The requisition specifies exactly what needs to be tested. I will also have my nurse schedule a follow-up appointment with me in two weeks to review your results and discuss further steps. It is important to follow these instructions diligently, Ms. Trefren. This is not a matter to be taken lightly. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, I understand. Dr. Ramirez, then. Shorter wait time sounds good. And Quest Diagnostics on Elm Street. I can do that. Two weeks for a follow-up. Okay. I can schedule that when I leave. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you explaining everything. It’s… a lot to take in, but I feel better knowing what I need to do. I’ll get this scheduled and get the tests done right away. Hopefully, we can get this sorted out quickly. I just want to be safe.
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Trefren. I expect to see you in two weeks with your results. Do not hesitate to contact the office if you have any questions.
