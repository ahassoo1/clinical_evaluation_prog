DOCTOR: Hi Aeisha, welcome. It’s lovely to meet you. I’m Dr. Georgiou. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Georgiou. It’s very nice to meet you as well. Well, to put it simply, I feel…stuck. Like I need a bit of a reset, a jumpstart, if you will. I haven't been feeling quite myself lately, and I'm hoping you can help me figure out what that means.
DOCTOR: "Stuck" – I hear you. That’s a really good way to put it, and a very common feeling, actually. Can you tell me a bit more about what that feels like?
PATIENT: It’s…hard to explain. It's not one specific thing. Just a general lack of energy, mostly. And a little…disinterest in things I used to enjoy. My work is fine, I can still do it, but I don’t have the same…spark, you know? Even getting up in the morning feels like a chore. It’s been going on for a few months now, I suppose. Not getting worse, necessarily, but definitely not improving.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a few months of low energy, decreased interest in things you usually enjoy, and it’s affecting your motivation even to start the day. That gives me a good starting point. Is this affecting your sleep at all?
PATIENT: Yes, actually. It's not that I can't sleep, but I don't sleep as soundly as I used to. I wake up a lot during the night, and I don’t always feel rested when I get up. It’s…a lighter sleep, if that makes sense. Not necessarily tossing and turning, just…not restorative. I usually get around six or seven hours, though.
DOCTOR: Six to seven hours, lighter sleep, waking up not feeling rested. Okay. And how about your appetite?
PATIENT: That’s…changed a little as well. I haven’t lost my appetite completely, but I don't feel hungry as often. I still eat, mostly because I know I should, but it’s not as enjoyable. I used to really look forward to meals, especially cooking. Now…it just feels like another thing on the list. I haven't really lost any weight, though, if that's what you're wondering.
DOCTOR: Good to know about the weight. So, decreased appetite, not necessarily a big change, but enough to notice. We're building a picture here. Have you noticed any changes in your mood beyond just the lack of interest?
PATIENT: Well… I wouldn’t say I’m sad, exactly. More…irritable, perhaps? Little things bother me more than they used to. My husband has noticed it, too. He says I’m quicker to snap at him, which I feel terrible about. It’s not constant, but it’s definitely been happening more lately. And I find myself worrying a little more, about…everything, really. Nothing specific, just a general sense of unease.
DOCTOR: Irritability and increased worry…that’s helpful to know. Okay. Let’s step back for a moment. Any significant life changes or stressors in the past few months?
PATIENT: Not really… not anything major. My daughter moved further away for a new job, which was a bit sad, but we talk on the phone often. Work has been the same, thankfully – no extra pressure or anything. Honestly, that’s part of why I’m so confused. Everything seems fine on paper, but I just don’t feel like myself. It's...frustrating.
DOCTOR: It sounds incredibly frustrating to feel this way when there isn't an obvious cause. That's actually quite common, Aeisha. Sometimes these things develop gradually, and it can be difficult to pinpoint a specific trigger. Okay. Now, I'm going to ask you a few questions about your medical history, if you don't mind. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions – high blood pressure, diabetes, thyroid problems, anything like that?
PATIENT: Not that I’m aware of, no. I had a bout of bad bronchitis a few years ago, but that cleared up completely. My mother had high blood pressure when she was older, but I’ve never been diagnosed with anything myself. I have regular check-ups with my primary care physician, and everything has always been normal. I do take a daily multivitamin, if that’s relevant.
DOCTOR: That's good to know about the regular check-ups and the multivitamin. And any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: No, thankfully. I haven’t needed any surgeries. I’ve been very lucky in that regard. Just the usual childhood immunizations, and a flu shot every year. I try to be good about those.
DOCTOR: Good. That's very responsible of you. Okay. Let's talk about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, cancer, depression, anxiety?
PATIENT: My father had heart disease, he passed away when he was in his seventies. And my aunt on my mother's side struggled with depression for many years. I don’t know a lot about it, honestly – it wasn’t something we talked about much in my family. My mother was very stoic. She had arthritis, but that’s about it, I think. I’m not sure about further back than that, to be honest. We don’t have a lot of medical history documented in my family.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful. So, heart disease on your father’s side and depression in your aunt. Now, before we move on, I just want to ask about allergies. Any known allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I’m aware of. I have no food allergies, and I’ve never had a reaction to any medication. I can take most antibiotics without any trouble. I don’t have any seasonal allergies, either – no hay fever or anything like that. I’m quite fortunate, really.
DOCTOR: You are very fortunate. Now, last question before we do a quick physical exam. Are you currently taking any other medications, besides the multivitamin?
PATIENT: No, just the multivitamin. Nothing else. I don’t like taking a lot of pills if I can avoid it, to be honest. I prefer to try and stay healthy naturally. So, that’s everything, I think?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s very thorough, thank you. Now, if you don’t mind, I’d like to do a quick physical exam – just listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and do a basic neurological assessment. It will only take a few minutes. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s perfectly alright. Please, go ahead. I’m ready whenever you are.
DOCTOR: Alright. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a few deep breaths for me. Blood pressure is 130/80, which is slightly elevated, but not dramatically so. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes and a few simple balance tests. Everything appears normal so far. No obvious neurological deficits. Your exam is largely unremarkable, which is good.
PATIENT: That's…reassuring to hear. So, what does that mean, Doctor? The slightly elevated blood pressure…and everything else being normal? What are your thoughts?
DOCTOR: Well, given your symptoms – the low energy, decreased interest, difficulty sleeping, and irritability – combined with the normal physical exam and slightly elevated blood pressure, there are a few possibilities we need to consider. One is simply stress – even if you don't feel particularly stressed, the body can react to subtle stressors. Another possibility is a mild vitamin deficiency, even with the multivitamin, or a thyroid issue, although your exam doesn't strongly suggest that. Finally, it's important to rule out depression, even though you say you don't feel sad. Sometimes depression can manifest as fatigue and loss of interest rather than overt sadness. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to order some blood tests. We'll check your complete blood count, thyroid function, vitamin D levels, and a basic metabolic panel. We can also do a slightly more comprehensive check for vitamin deficiencies. Do that sound alright?
PATIENT: That all sounds very sensible. Stress…yes, perhaps. I hadn’t really considered that. The blood tests seem like a good idea. Yes, please. Definitely. The depression…I don’t know. It’s just…not what I expected. But if that’s what it takes to figure out what’s wrong, then I’m willing to try.
DOCTOR: It’s good that you’re open to exploring all possibilities. And it’s important to remember that “depression” is a broad term, and it doesn’t always look the same. Often, it presents differently in different people. We'll get the results back in a few days, and then we can discuss the best course of action. In the meantime, I want you to try and focus on self-care – getting enough sleep, eating healthy, and engaging in activities you enjoy, even if you don’t feel like it. I’m also going to give you a brief questionnaire to fill out called the PHQ-9. It’s a standard depression screening tool. It will just help us get a better understanding of your mood and thought patterns. Would you like to do that now?
PATIENT: Yes, please. That sounds good. The questionnaire...I'm happy to fill it out. Anything that can help. Thank you for explaining everything so thoroughly, Doctor. It makes me feel much better, just knowing we're taking steps to figure this out.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Aeisha. That's what I'm here for. Take your time with the questionnaire, and feel free to ask if you have any questions. Once you’re done, we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms – like difficulty breathing, chest pain, or thoughts of harming yourself – please contact my office immediately, or go to the nearest emergency room. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, I understand completely. Thank you for being so thorough, and for making me feel comfortable. I will certainly contact the office if anything changes. It’s a relief to finally be doing something about this.
DOCTOR: Take all the time you need. I'll be right here when you're finished.
PATIENT: Here you go. I tried to answer as honestly as possible. I hope it’s helpful. Is there anything else I need to do today, or should we just wait for the blood test results?
DOCTOR: Thank you. This is helpful. It does suggest that there may be some underlying mood issues to explore further. We'll see what the blood tests reveal. Based on these results and the questionnaire, I’d like to schedule a follow-up appointment for about a week from today. That will give the lab time to process the results, and allow us time to discuss them thoroughly. How does next Tuesday at 2:00 PM sound?
PATIENT: Tuesday at 2:00 PM sounds perfect. Thank you so much, Doctor. I feel much more optimistic now, just having a plan in place. I appreciate your patience and understanding.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Aeisha. I'm glad I could help. Remember, don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns before our next appointment. Here’s a lab requisition form – you can take this to any lab, but if you’d like, our receptionist can help you schedule an appointment at a lab near you. It was a pleasure meeting you, and I look forward to seeing you next week. Have a good day.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You as well. I will definitely let your receptionist know. I have a feeling things will be better soon.
