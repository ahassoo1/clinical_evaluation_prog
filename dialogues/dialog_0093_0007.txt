DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Reihner. It’s a pleasure to meet you. My name is Dr. Eriberto Bakan. I understand you're here today for a consultation. Could you tell me a bit about what brings you in?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is… painful. That is why I am here. I work with fence, you see. Erecting it. And it hurts. I wish to be quick, if that is alright.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Reihner. We'll get right to it. Pain is never alright, and I appreciate you coming in to address it. When you say "it hurts," could you be a bit more specific?
PATIENT: It hurts… my back. Lower back, mostly. And sometimes down my leg. The right one. It started… let me think… July 15th. Lifting a post, heavy one. It felt a pull then, and now… well, now it is constant. Not always bad, but always there. I need to keep working, Doctor. I have bills.
DOCTOR: I understand. July 15th, lifting a post – that gives us a good starting point. Constant pain is concerning, especially with radiating discomfort down your leg. To help me understand better, could you describe the pain itself?
PATIENT: Describe… how it feels? It is… sharp, sometimes. Like a knife. Other times, it is just… dull. A heavy ache. And when I move certain ways… especially bending over… it feels like something is caught. I do not know how to explain it better. It is just… wrong. Is that helpful, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Yes, that is helpful, Ms. Reihner. “Sharp like a knife” and “dull ache” – that helps me differentiate the type of pain you’re experiencing. And the sensation of something being “caught” is important. Now, on a scale of zero to ten, with zero being no pain and ten being the worst pain imaginable, what would you rate your pain right now?
PATIENT: Right now… let me think. It is not ten, certainly. I have had worse. But it is not low, either. Maybe a… six? It is distracting. I have to be careful how I sit, how I stand. And when I lie down… it does not always help. Sometimes it feels worse when I am trying to rest.
DOCTOR: A six, distracting and affecting your sleep, that is significant. I want to get a better understanding of what might be contributing to this. Do you notice anything that improves the pain?
PATIENT: Improves…? Not much, truthfully. Sitting very still sometimes helps, but I cannot stay still. That is my job. Hot water on my back feels a little better, briefly. And… lying with a pillow under my knees, I suppose. But it is temporary. It always comes back. And when it is bad… nothing seems to help. Is that… is that useful information, Doctor? I am not good at explaining these things.
DOCTOR: You’re doing very well, Ms. Reihner. It’s often difficult to describe pain, and you're providing very useful information. Knowing what makes it slightly better is as important as knowing what makes it worse. Now, let's talk about your medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you ever had back problems before – any injuries, surgeries, or treatments?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never. This is… new. I have been healthy, mostly. A cold here and there. But nothing like this. No injuries. No surgeries. My husband… he was the one who went to the doctor. I just took care of him. I am not used to being the patient. Medicare is what I have for insurance, if that matters.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. And you're quite right, it’s a different experience being the patient. Medicare is fine; we accept it here. Now, could you tell me about any other medical conditions you may have, like diabetes, high blood pressure, or anything else?
PATIENT: No. Nothing. I have no conditions. I watch what I eat. I walk when I can, when my back allows. My husband… he had trouble with his heart. But I do not. I am… I was a caregiver. Mostly. I am strong. Or, I was. Before this pain. Is there anything else you need to know, Doctor? I would like to finish if possible. I have work to do.
DOCTOR: That's excellent to hear, Ms. Reihner. Knowing you’re generally healthy gives us a good starting point. Before we proceed, let's briefly discuss any medications you're currently taking, including over-the-counter drugs and supplements.
PATIENT: Nothing. I take no medications. Not even a headache pill. My husband… he had many. I avoid them if I can. Just vitamins sometimes. A multi-vitamin, for general health. But I have not taken any regularly in months, I think. I rely on… hard work. And hot water. Is that all, Doctor? Really, I need to be going soon.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Reihner. No medications, no recent supplements – that's helpful. And I understand you're eager to return to work. To get a better understanding of what might be causing your pain, I'd like to conduct a brief physical examination. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Physical… examination? What does that involve, Doctor? I am… hesitant. I do not like being poked and prodded. I need to know. Is it quick? Will it hurt? I need to be sure before I agree. This back… it is very sensitive.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly understandable, Ms. Reihner. It's always good to be cautious. A physical exam will involve me gently checking your range of motion – how well you can bend, twist, and move your back. I’ll also be feeling your back for tenderness or any muscle spasms. I'll also do some simple neurological tests to check your reflexes and sensation in your legs and feet. I will be as gentle as possible, and I will stop immediately if you feel any significant pain. It shouldn't be painful, but you might feel some slight discomfort. It will take approximately ten to fifteen minutes. Would you like me to explain any part of it in more detail?
PATIENT: Ten to fifteen minutes… Alright. If it is truly gentle. I do not want to make it worse. And if I feel any real pain… I want you to stop. Immediately. I need to work, Doctor. This is important. Explain the tests, if you would. I like to know what is happening. And do not expect me to lie down. I cannot lie still for long.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Reihner. I will be very mindful of your discomfort. We'll minimize movement as much as possible. First, I’ll observe your posture and how you walk. Then, I’ll ask you to gently bend forward, backward, and sideways to see how far you can move without pain. I'll also ask you to twist your torso. I will not force you to do anything that causes significant discomfort. Then, I’ll gently feel along your spine and the muscles on either side, checking for tenderness or spasms. Finally, I'll test your reflexes and sensation in your legs and feet to see if there's any nerve involvement. This involves a light touch and a gentle tap with a small hammer. You do not need to lie down for the entire exam; we can adapt the tests so you can remain standing or seated. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Standing… yes. That is better. No lying. And gentle is key, Doctor. I am a fence worker, not a… delicate flower. But this back… it is bad. Alright. Let us get it over with. Quickly, please. I have posts waiting.
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Reihner. We'll be as efficient as possible. I’ll start with your posture and gait. Please just walk across the room naturally, as you normally would. Okay, Ms. Reihner. Now, if you could just stand comfortably, with your arms relaxed at your sides… Just let me know if anything feels particularly uncomfortable. I'm feeling some mild muscle tension in your lower back, particularly on the right side. Any pain with this pressure?
PATIENT: Mild… yes. That is… noticeable. But not sharp. Like a dull ache, like I told you. It is… constant, mostly. It doesn't suddenly hurt when you touch it. It just… is. It's hard to explain. Is that helpful, Doctor? I am trying to be precise. I do not want to waste your time. And I really do need to get back to work. These fences won't build themselves.
DOCTOR: That is very helpful, Ms. Reihner. A constant, dull ache is important information. Now, I'd like you to slowly bend forward from your waist, keeping your knees straight as much as possible. Just go as far as you can comfortably go. I’ll be observing your range of motion. And how does that feel?
PATIENT: Ooh… that is… not good. It pulls. Down my leg, mostly. That right leg. Not a sharp pain, but… a stretching. And it feels… stuck. Like something is caught. I cannot go much further. It hurts to push it. And it will be harder to get back up. I am not young, Doctor. I do not bend like I used to.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Reihner. Take your time. No need to rush. I am here to support you. And how does that feel returning to standing?
PATIENT: Ooh… that is worse. Like a… a knot tightening. And now my leg is… tingling. Just a little. Not numb, but… a pins and needles feeling. Down the back of my leg. Is that… is that bad? I do not like that tingling. I need to get back to work, Doctor. These fences… they won't build themselves. I have deadlines. And bills.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Reihner. Let’s take a seat for a moment. The tingling in your leg is concerning, and we need to address it. It suggests potential nerve involvement. Now, I’m going to perform a simple neurological test to assess your reflexes. I’ll gently tap the back of your knee with this small hammer. Just relax your leg, and let it respond naturally. Now, I'm going to test your sensation. Can you tell me if you can feel this light touch?
PATIENT: Testing… reflexes. Light touch. Alright. That… tickles. But it does not feel normal. It feels… weaker. On the right leg, I think. Not a big difference, but… something is not right. And the light touch… yes, I can feel it. Both sides. But the right side… it feels… duller. Not completely gone, but… muted. Like wearing a thick glove. Does that make sense, Doctor? I am trying to be precise. I need to get back to work. Soon. These fences won't build themselves.
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Reihner, that makes perfect sense. Diminished sensation and a weaker reflex on the right side are significant findings. Based on your history, the physical examination, and the neurological findings, my preliminary assessment is that you are experiencing radiculopathy, likely due to a compressed nerve in your lower back. This is consistent with a possible herniated disc or spinal stenosis. Now, to confirm this diagnosis and rule out any other potential causes, I recommend an MRI of your lower spine. This will allow us to visualize the nerves and identify the source of the compression. In the meantime, I recommend limiting strenuous activities, particularly lifting and bending. We can also discuss some pain management options, such as over-the-counter anti-inflammatory medications and physical therapy. Would you like me to write you a prescription for something in the meantime?
PATIENT: MRI…? That sounds… expensive. And time-consuming. I cannot afford to be out of work for long. And I need to work to afford… well, everything. Anti-inflammatory…? Those make my stomach upset. Physical therapy…? Is that… walking? Stretching? I can do some of that myself. I do not need someone telling me what to do. What if it is… serious? What if I need surgery? I have heard horror stories. I just need to get back to work, Doctor. I need to build these fences. What do you recommend I do right now to get back to work? Is there something you can give me to take to make the pain better? Just enough to get through the day?
DOCTOR: I understand your worries completely, Ms. Reihner. The MRI is the best way to get a definitive diagnosis, and we can explore financial assistance options if cost is a concern. We can also discuss alternative imaging studies if that’s preferred, though they may not provide as much detail. Surgery is rarely the first option, and we would only consider it if other treatments fail. In the vast majority of cases, radiculopathy can be managed effectively with conservative measures like physical therapy, pain medication, and lifestyle modifications. For immediate pain relief, I can prescribe a short course of a muscle relaxant to help alleviate the muscle spasms and ease the nerve compression. However, it’s important to note that muscle relaxants can cause drowsiness, so you’ll need to be cautious when operating machinery or driving. I do not recommend returning to strenuous activities at this time. Continuing to lift and bend could worsen your condition and prolong your recovery. However, I understand your financial concerns. I can write you a prescription for a low-dose pain reliever and muscle relaxant, and I can provide a work excuse for limited duty for the next week. This would allow you to return to work with restrictions, avoiding lifting, bending, and any activities that exacerbate your pain. We will also schedule a follow-up appointment next week to reassess your condition and discuss your options for further treatment. Does that sound acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Limited duty… yes. That is… acceptable. As long as I can earn something. I need to pay the bills. And no heavy lifting… I can manage that. I am not getting any younger. A work excuse… yes. That will help. And no heavy lifting for a week… alright. I can do that. Muscle relaxant… will it make me sleepy? I need to be alert when I am working with the fence. Safety is important. And I do not want to fall. Do I need to fill out any forms? For the work excuse? And the prescription? I have my Medicare card here. I need to get back to work as soon as possible, Doctor. These fences won't build themselves. It's just… hard. Really hard.
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Reihner, I understand. We’ll work together to get you back on your feet. The muscle relaxant can cause some drowsiness, but it varies from person to person. We’ll start with a low dose and see how you tolerate it. If it makes you too sleepy, we can adjust the dosage or switch to a different medication. It's crucial to prioritize your safety, so please do not operate heavy machinery if you feel impaired. Here's the work excuse, stating that you can return to limited duty, avoiding lifting, bending, and strenuous activities for the next week. And here's the prescription. The pharmacy will provide instructions on how to take the medication. Please let me know if you have any side effects or concerns. Here is my information and the clinic’s contact information. If you have trouble getting the medication filled or have any questions, please don’t hesitate to call the office. I recommend scheduling a follow-up appointment for next week to reassess your condition. In the meantime, please rest as much as possible and avoid any activities that aggravate your pain. Do you have any other questions or concerns I can address before you leave?
PATIENT: Alright. Limited duty. No heavy lifting. Muscle relaxant… I hope it does not make me too sleepy. One question, Doctor. If the pain… gets worse? If the tingling… gets worse? What do I do? Do I go to the emergency room? I do not want to waste my time… or your time. But I do not want to make it worse, either. Thank you, Doctor. You have been… helpful. It is just… hard. Really hard. But I need to get back to work. These fences won't build themselves. I have bills to pay. I think… that is all. For now. But if the pain gets worse… I will call. I promise.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Reihner. It was my pleasure to assist you. And you're right to ask about what to do if your condition worsens. If you experience any of the following, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately: Sudden weakness in your legs or feet Loss of bowel or bladder control Severe, unrelenting pain that does not respond to medication Numbness or tingling that spreads rapidly Otherwise, if the pain simply increases gradually, or the tingling worsens, please call the office as soon as possible, and we will schedule an earlier follow-up appointment. Do not hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns, even if they seem minor. I wish you the best, Ms. Reihner. Please take care of yourself, and prioritize your safety. Remember, these fences can wait if your health is at risk. And please, call if you have any questions or concerns. .
PATIENT: .
