DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Bilstein. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Shely. It’s a pleasure to meet you. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s… nice to meet you as well. Let me see… what brings me in… Well, my legs, mostly. They bother me something awful at night. Cramping, you see. Keeps me up, it does. It’s been going on for… oh, goodness, I can't rightly say how long. A while, certainly.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Ms. Bilstein. Leg cramping at night can be quite disruptive. To help me understand what might be causing this, could you describe the cramping in more detail?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, disruptive is a good word for it. Well, it’s… a tightening. A hard squeezing, mostly in the calves, I think. Both legs, usually. It just… comes on suddenly. Not always, but often. And it’s painful. Not a sharp pain, but a deep ache. Makes me want to just… hold on tight and wait it out. It does go away, eventually, but it takes a bit. Do you… understand? It's hard to explain, sometimes.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand perfectly, Ms. Bilstein. A deep ache and tightening in the calves that comes on suddenly and then gradually subsides. That sounds very uncomfortable. Now, to get a better picture, could you tell me if anything seems to trigger these cramps?
PATIENT: Triggers… hmm. That’s a good question. I… don’t know. Not that I’ve noticed, anyway. I walk a bit, mostly around the house. I used to garden, but it’s been a while now. I don't do anything strenuous, if that’s what you mean. Sometimes, if I stand for too long, maybe? But even then, not always. Honestly, Doctor, I haven't a clue. It just… happens. It feels rather random, if you ask me.
DOCTOR: I see. So, it doesn't seem consistently related to activity or standing. That does make it a bit more challenging to pinpoint the cause. Now, let’s talk a little about your overall health. Do you have any other medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… I had a bit of trouble with my heart, years and years ago. But the doctor said it was… settled. That was a long time back. I get a little tired now and then, but I figured that’s just from getting old. I don't really have any conditions, not that I know of. I used to see a doctor regularly, but… well, that was a while ago. I haven't been to one in… a long time. I’m not much trouble, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Ms. Bilstein. It’s helpful to know about the previous heart trouble, even if it was years ago. And it’s perfectly alright that you haven’t been to a doctor in a while. We’ll get a good understanding of what’s going on today. Just to be thorough, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything other than the heart issue you mentioned?
PATIENT: Surgeries… let me see. Oh! Yes, I had my appendix taken out when I was a young woman. A very long time ago, of course. And… I think I was in the hospital once with a bad bout of the flu, but that was so long ago I hardly remember it. Nothing major, Doctor. Really. Just the appendix, and maybe the flu. I've been quite lucky, all things considered. I don’t bother doctors much, usually.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Ms. Bilstein. Appendix removal and a bout of the flu – thank you for letting me know. Now, could you tell me about any medications you are currently taking, including any over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, no, dear. I don't take any medications. Not a one. I used to take something for my blood pressure, a long time back, but the doctor took me off of it. I try to stay away from those things if I can. And I don’t much believe in those supplements. Just a waste of money, if you ask me. I drink my tea, and that’s about it. Old-fashioned, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Alright, no medications or supplements. Thank you for clarifying. Now, are there any allergies I should be aware of – to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Not that I know of. I eat most things. I used to get a bit of a rash from poison ivy when I was a girl, but that was a long time ago and I haven’t been in the woods for… oh, goodness, decades. I don’t think I’m allergic to anything, Doctor. I’ve always been quite sturdy, really. Not much bothers me.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, Ms. Bilstein. No known allergies. Now, to get a better understanding of your family health history, are there any medical conditions that run in your family – such as heart disease, diabetes, or arthritis?
PATIENT: Oh, family… That’s a hard one. My mother… she had a weak heart, I think. She wasn't well when she was older. And my brother… he had something with his joints, maybe arthritis? He walked with a cane towards the end. My father… he was a strong man, always healthy. As for the rest… It’s been so long, and we didn’t talk much about those things. I don’t remember much, honestly. A bit of heart trouble, maybe some joint problems. That's about all I can recall. We weren't a family for sharing, if you understand.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Bilstein. It’s common for family medical histories to be incomplete. Knowing about the heart trouble and potential arthritis in your family is helpful. Now, I’d like to ask a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke or use tobacco products?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no! I would never! My mother always said it was a terrible habit. I’ve never touched a cigarette in my life. Never even wanted to. A waste of money, and bad for your health, she’d say. No, Doctor, I don't smoke. And I certainly don't use any of those… other things.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful, Ms. Bilstein. Thank you for sharing that. And how about alcohol?
PATIENT: Well, now… a little bit of sherry, sometimes. On special occasions, you understand. A small glass with dinner, perhaps. I don't drink much, and not very often. It helps me relax, a little. But it's not a habit, dear. Certainly not. Just a small treat now and then. I'm not much of a drinker, if that’s what you’re asking.
DOCTOR: Alright, a small amount of sherry on occasion. That's good to know. Now, Ms. Bilstein, before we move on, could you tell me a little about your typical daily activity?
PATIENT: Oh, well… I mostly stay around the house. I do a little bit of light housework, you know. Dusting, washing dishes… nothing strenuous. I enjoy reading, mostly. And I like to watch the birds out the window. I walk a bit, mostly around the rooms. I used to garden, but it’s been quite a while since I’ve been able to do that. I try to keep myself busy, but I don't do much running around, if that's what you mean. It’s a quiet life, Doctor. A very quiet life.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Bilstein. That gives me a good picture of your daily routine. Now, I’d like to perform a brief physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I’ll start by checking your blood pressure and pulse. It would also be helpful to listen to your heart and lungs, and examine your legs, where you’ve been experiencing the cramping. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Oh… alright. If you think it’s necessary. I don't mind, dear. I haven’t had a proper check-up in… well, a very long time. It's just… I’m not used to all of this. Do you promise it won’t take too long? And will it… hurt? I suppose if it will help my legs, I’m willing to try. Just be gentle, dear. Very gentle.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Bilstein. I promise to be as gentle as possible. It shouldn't hurt at all. It will only take a few minutes. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, but not significantly. And your pulse is normal. Your heart sounds are a bit quiet, but otherwise normal. Your lungs sound clear. Now, I'm examining your legs. Your muscles feel normal, with no swelling. Your reflexes are a little slow, and your pulses are a bit weak, but they are present. I don’t note any skin changes or signs of inflammation. Do you experience any numbness or tingling in your legs or feet?
PATIENT: Numbness… tingling… hmm. Sometimes, yes. Not often, but occasionally. Mostly in my feet, I think. A little pins and needles feeling. It doesn't last long, though. Just comes and goes. I figured it was just… old age, dear. The circulation not being what it used to be. It’s not painful, just… uncomfortable. Does that make sense? It’s hard to describe, really. A little bit like when your foot falls asleep, but not as bad. Is that… bad?
DOCTOR: That’s helpful to know, Ms. Bilstein. The numbness and tingling, along with the weak pulses and slightly diminished reflexes, suggests some possible peripheral artery disease, or PAD, though further testing would be needed to confirm that. This means there may be some reduced blood flow to your legs and feet. Given your symptoms of leg cramping at night, the numbness and tingling, and the findings from the physical exam, I suspect the cramping may be related to this reduced circulation. It’s also important to consider the slightly elevated blood pressure, as that can contribute to vascular problems. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order a few tests. Would you be willing to have a simple blood test to check your cholesterol and blood sugar levels?
PATIENT: Blood tests… oh dear. I haven’t had one of those in ages. But… if it will help, then yes. Yes, I suppose so. Cholesterol… and blood sugar… Is something… wrong? I try to eat healthy, mostly. Not much sugar, you know. Are you saying… I have something serious? Just tell me… will it hurt? And will it take long? I do get anxious about these things, dear. It's just… getting old isn't easy, you know.
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Ms. Bilstein. Please don’t worry. A blood test is a very simple procedure. It doesn’t usually hurt much – just a quick pinch. And it doesn't take long at all - only a few minutes. I’m not saying you have something serious, but these tests will help me rule out any underlying causes for your symptoms and determine the best course of treatment. The blood tests will check for high cholesterol, which can contribute to blocked arteries, and high blood sugar, which can damage blood vessels over time. I also think it would be helpful to perform an ankle-brachial index test. This is a non-invasive test where I measure the blood pressure in your ankles and compare it to the blood pressure in your arms. It can help me assess the blood flow to your legs and confirm whether there is any significant blockage. Would you be willing to have that test done as well?
PATIENT: Blocked arteries… oh dear. It sounds… frightening. But if you think it’s necessary, then yes. Yes, I suppose so. I trust your judgment, Doctor. You seem very knowledgeable. Ankle-brachial… what was it? Another test, yes. As long as it doesn’t hurt too much. And it doesn’t take long. I do get tired easily, you know. And anxious. When will I know the results? And… what if it is something serious? Will I need… surgery? Oh dear.
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Ms. Bilstein. Let’s take things one step at a time. The ABI test is very simple and painless. I’ll use a special device to measure the blood pressure in your arms and ankles – that’s all. It will only take about 15-20 minutes. As for the results, I should have them back within a few days. Once I have the results, I’ll review them with you and explain everything in detail. It’s too early to say whether you’ll need surgery. Most cases of mild peripheral artery disease can be managed with lifestyle changes, such as regular exercise, a healthy diet, and medication to lower cholesterol and blood pressure. If the disease is more severe, surgery may be an option, but we’ll cross that bridge if we come to it. For now, let’s focus on getting these tests done. I’ll write you a referral for the blood work and the ABI test. The lab and the vascular specialist's office will contact you to schedule appointments. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: No… I don’t think so. Just… appointments. And results. It all sounds… a bit much. I suppose I should call them, then? The lab and… the vascular specialist. Do you have the numbers written down? And… what should I tell them? That Doctor Shely sent me? I’m not very good with these things, dear. I get confused easily. And anxious. Is there… anyone I can call to help me with this? A friend? A family member?
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Bilstein. Don't worry, I'm happy to help. Here is the referral sheet with the lab and the vascular specialist’s contact information. Yes, just tell them that Doctor Shely referred you. They will have everything they need. And no, you don’t need to worry about confusing anyone. It’s perfectly alright to ask for help. If you have a friend or family member who can assist you with scheduling the appointments, that would be wonderful. If not, the lab and the specialist’s office are usually very helpful with making arrangements over the phone. I’ll also have my nurse, Sarah, call you tomorrow to check in and see if you need any assistance with scheduling the appointments. She’s very patient and understanding, and she can answer any questions you may have. For now, let’s just focus on taking things one step at a time. You’ve already taken the first step by coming in today. And I’m here to support you every step of the way. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Sarah… yes, that sounds… nice. Having someone to call. That would be… helpful. I think… I think that’s all for now, Doctor. Thank you for your patience. And for explaining everything so clearly. I do feel a little… better, knowing that there’s a plan. Even if it is… a bit frightening. I suppose I should be going now. Thank you again, Doctor. And thank you to Sarah, too. I do hope… I do hope everything will be alright. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Bilstein. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. And remember, we’ll take things one step at a time. Sarah will be in touch tomorrow, and I’m always here to support you. Please be careful walking, and take your time. .
