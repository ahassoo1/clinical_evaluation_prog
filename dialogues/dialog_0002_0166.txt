DOCTOR: Hi Tarin, welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Ranjan. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: It’s a pleasure to meet you as well, Dr. Ranjan. Thank you for having me. I’ve been experiencing some numbness in my leg, and it’s become… persistent enough that I thought it best to have it checked out. It started a few weeks ago, I believe it was around July 10th, though I recall the exact time quite clearly – 3:17 PM, I was working on a particularly detailed animation sequence.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good you came in to get it checked out. Numbness can be a little concerning, and it's helpful to know when it started. July 10th, around 3:17 PM… you have a good memory! And it was related to work – specifically, detailed animation work. Can you tell me a little more about the numbness itself?
PATIENT: Yes, my grandmother always said I remembered everything. It can be… a bit much, at times. As for the numbness, it began in my left leg, starting in my foot and slowly working its way up my calf. It isn’t constant. There are periods where I don't notice it at all, but it returns, usually after I’ve been sitting for a prolonged duration – working, mostly. It feels… like a pins-and-needles sensation, but not painful, exactly. More… absent. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense, Tarin. And yes, a good memory can be… a lot! “Absent” is a good way to describe it. So, it started in the foot, moved up the calf, comes and goes, and is triggered by prolonged sitting, especially when you're working. No pain, just a pins-and-needles sensation or feeling of absence. Is it just your left leg, or have you noticed it in other parts of your body at all?
PATIENT: No, it’s been exclusively my left leg. I’ve been… actively monitoring it, if you will, since it began. I haven’t experienced anything similar in my right leg, my arms, or anywhere else. I did briefly wonder if it was related to my posture while I was animating, but I consciously adjusted how I sit, and it hasn't made a difference, unfortunately. I recall making the adjustment on July 14th, around 10:23 AM. It was a slight alteration to the lumbar support on my chair.
DOCTOR: Okay, very thorough monitoring, Tarin – that’s great! Just the left leg, no spread. And you adjusted your posture on July 14th at 10:23 AM, without any improvement. Let's talk a little bit about your overall health. Have you had any other medical issues in the past?
PATIENT: Not significantly, no. I had a bout of influenza when I was sixteen – February 28th, 2009, I believe – but I recovered fully. Aside from that, I’ve always been quite healthy, generally. I maintain a relatively active lifestyle – walking, mostly – and I eat a balanced diet. I’ve never been diagnosed with any chronic conditions, and I haven’t had any surgeries. I do have private insurance, if that’s relevant. I recall signing up for the plan on April 5th, 2023. It’s with North Star Health.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. Influenza when you were sixteen, full recovery, generally healthy, active lifestyle, balanced diet, no chronic conditions or surgeries. And you have North Star Health insurance – that’s helpful. Do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I’m aware of. I’ve never experienced an allergic reaction to anything – food, medications, plants, anything. I recall trying various foods as a child – my grandmother was quite keen on introducing me to new flavors – and never having an issue. I haven’t taken any medications regularly, so there hasn’t been much opportunity for a reaction, I suppose. I occasionally take over-the-counter pain relievers for minor headaches, but nothing consistent.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies, no regular medications. That’s good. Let’s talk about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family – things like diabetes, heart disease, nerve problems, anything like that?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. My maternal grandmother, Elsie, had type 2 diabetes, diagnosed around 1988, I believe – October 12th, specifically. She managed it for quite some time, but it did contribute to complications later in life. My father’s side… my paternal grandfather, Samuel, had heart disease. He had a bypass surgery in 1995, but ultimately passed away due to complications. As for nerve problems… I don’t recall anyone specifically being diagnosed with anything like that, but my aunt, Beatrice, has occasionally mentioned experiencing tingling sensations in her hands, though she hasn’t sought medical attention for it. It’s been… intermittent, I understand.
DOCTOR: Okay, so maternal grandmother with type 2 diabetes, paternal grandfather with heart disease, and your aunt with intermittent tingling sensations. That’s helpful to know. Now, a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, I do not smoke. I occasionally drink alcohol – a glass of wine with dinner, perhaps, on social occasions – but very rarely. And no, I do not use any recreational drugs. I believe I last consumed alcohol on June 18th, a small glass of Pinot Noir with a friend. I generally prefer to maintain a healthy lifestyle, as I mentioned previously. I find it… conducive to my work, and to my overall well-being.
DOCTOR: Okay, no smoking, very rare alcohol use, no recreational drugs. That's good. Alright, Tarin, that gives me a good overview. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam to get a better sense of what’s going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. That sounds perfectly reasonable. Please, proceed at your convenience. I trust your judgment, Dr. Ranjan. I recall reading your credentials before scheduling the appointment – quite impressive, if I may say so. Specifically, your research on peripheral nerve disorders.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Tarin. I'm glad you found that helpful. Alright, let’s start. I'm going to have you lie down on the examination table. I'll check your reflexes, muscle strength, and sensation in your legs, and then I'll listen to your pulses. First, let's start with your reflexes. Can you bend your knees and let your legs relax?
PATIENT: Certainly. As you wish. I will do my best to remain relaxed. I do occasionally experience slight muscle tension, especially in my back, but I will endeavor to keep my legs loose. I recall a massage therapist recommending progressive muscle relaxation techniques… I should perhaps revisit those. I lie down on the examination table, positioning myself as comfortably as possible. Proceed when you are ready, Dr. Ranjan.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Relax your legs completely. Your reflexes are… a little diminished on your left side, compared to your right. Not dramatically, but noticeable. Now, I’m going to check your muscle strength. Can you push your heel down against my hand?
PATIENT: Yes, I understand. I will push down with my heel as firmly as I can. I recall participating in a strength training program briefly in 2020… it was a rather grueling regimen, focusing primarily on core and leg strength. I'm not currently in peak physical condition, but I should be able to provide adequate resistance. I exert force against Dr. Ranjan’s hand, maintaining a steady pressure.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. And now, the other leg. Your strength is… slightly reduced on your left side as well, compared to the right. It's subtle, but there is a difference. Now, I’m going to check your sensation. I’m going to lightly touch different parts of your leg with this cotton ball. Can you tell me when and where you feel the touch?
PATIENT: Yes, I understand. I will close my eyes and concentrate on the touch. I recall reading that focusing on internal sensations can enhance perceptual accuracy. Please proceed at your own pace. I will alert you immediately when I feel the cotton ball on my skin. I lie still, attempting to remain as receptive as possible.
DOCTOR: Okay… and now the outer calf… and the inner calf… and the top of the foot… Your sensation is… slightly diminished on the left foot and lower leg, compared to the right. It’s not completely absent, but it takes a little longer for you to perceive the touch on the left side. Alright, that completes the physical exam. I’ve also listened to your pulses, and they are both strong and equal. Based on the exam, it appears there is some mild weakness and diminished sensation in your left leg. The diminished reflexes are also a little concerning. These findings suggest there might be some nerve involvement. Now, to get a clearer picture, I’d like to order a few tests – an MRI of your lumbar spine and some nerve conduction studies. These tests will help us determine if there’s any compression of the nerves in your lower back or if there’s damage to the nerves themselves. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… prudent. An MRI and nerve conduction studies. I recall reading about those procedures previously – they seem quite standard for diagnosing nerve-related issues. I trust your judgment, Dr. Ranjan. I understand that further investigation is necessary to determine the precise cause of these symptoms. I am agreeable to proceeding with those tests. Could you perhaps elaborate on the process involved in each? Specifically, the duration, and any potential discomfort I should anticipate? I recall a colleague mentioning a rather unpleasant experience with an MRI machine… though I understand that technology has advanced considerably since then.
DOCTOR: Yes, you're right to ask. It’s good to be informed. Let's start with the MRI. It stands for Magnetic Resonance Imaging, and it uses strong magnets and radio waves to create detailed images of your spine. It’s non-invasive – meaning it doesn’t involve any needles or incisions. You’ll lie on a table that slides into a large, tunnel-like machine. It can be a bit claustrophobic for some people, but we can give you a mild sedative if you’re anxious. The scan itself usually takes about 30-45 minutes. You'll need to lie very still during the scan, and it will be noisy – we’ll provide you with headphones. As for discomfort, most people don’t experience any pain, but you might feel a little warm. Now, the nerve conduction studies. These tests measure how quickly electrical signals travel through your nerves. We’ll attach small electrodes to your skin, and then we’ll send small electrical impulses through your nerves. You might feel a slight tingling or buzzing sensation – it’s usually not painful, but it can be uncomfortable. It takes about 30-60 minutes, and we'll focus on the nerves in your legs and feet. Do you have any metal implants or pacemakers?
PATIENT: No, I do not have any metal implants or pacemakers. I recall having a comprehensive medical evaluation in 2022 prior to an international trip, and nothing of that nature was detected. I am not currently taking any medication, and I have no history of surgical procedures. The MRI machine’s potential for interaction with metal is something I had considered, and I am relieved to hear that it is not a concern. The nerve conduction studies sound… less comfortable, perhaps, but certainly manageable. I appreciate you detailing the procedures so thoroughly, Dr. Ranjan. It alleviates my anxieties considerably. Regarding scheduling, is there a preferred time for these tests? I am relatively flexible, and I can adjust my work schedule accordingly. I recall a colleague recommending avoiding peak hours to minimize wait times.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know you don’t have any metal implants. And you’re right to ask about wait times - it’s always best to plan ahead. The radiology department is generally less busy in the mornings, before 10:00 AM, and on Wednesdays. If you can, scheduling the MRI and nerve conduction studies on a Wednesday morning would be ideal. It will likely take a couple of hours to complete both tests. I will have my nurse, Sarah, schedule those for you. She’ll also give you some specific instructions about preparing for the tests, such as avoiding caffeine and certain medications. In the meantime, I recommend continuing to monitor your symptoms. If you experience any worsening of your numbness, weakness, or develop any new symptoms, such as bowel or bladder problems, please contact me immediately. Those could be signs of a more serious condition. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly reasonable - a Wednesday morning appointment would be ideal. I appreciate Sarah scheduling those for me, and I will certainly adhere to any preparatory instructions provided. Regarding worsening symptoms… yes, I suppose I should clarify what constitutes a "significant" worsening. If the numbness were to radiate beyond my left leg, or if I experienced any loss of motor control, that would warrant immediate attention, correct? And the bowel and bladder symptoms you mentioned… are those indicative of cauda equina syndrome, perhaps? I recall reading about that condition briefly in a medical journal. Otherwise, I believe that answers my questions for the time being. Thank you once again for your thorough assessment and clear explanations, Dr. Ranjan. I am confident that we are proceeding with a sound diagnostic plan.
DOCTOR: You’re very well-informed, Tarin, and you're absolutely right to ask. Yes, if the numbness were to spread beyond your left leg, or if you experienced any loss of motor control – such as difficulty walking or weakness in your foot – that would definitely warrant immediate attention. And yes, the bowel and bladder symptoms I mentioned can be indicative of cauda equina syndrome, which is a serious condition requiring urgent medical intervention. It’s a rare, but important possibility to be aware of. We’ll keep that in mind as we evaluate your condition. For now, let’s focus on getting those tests done. We’ll review the results together and determine the best course of action. I’m glad I could address your concerns, and please don’t hesitate to contact me if anything changes. Sarah will be in touch shortly to schedule those tests. Have a good day, Tarin.
PATIENT: Thank you, Dr. Ranjan. I appreciate your time and expertise. I will certainly be in touch if anything changes. I recall your name – Jessieca, is it? It was a pleasure meeting you, and I look forward to reviewing the test results together.
