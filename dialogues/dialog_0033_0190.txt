DOCTOR: Right. Ms. Snerling, yes. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, um… it’s this… unsteadiness. I keep feeling… off balance. It’s been happening for a little while now, I think. It’s hard to say how long, exactly. Things just feel… wobbly, sometimes. Not all the time, but enough to be worrying.
DOCTOR: "Wobbly," right. And how long is “a little while”?
PATIENT: Oh dear… that’s the tricky part. I… honestly, it feels like months. Maybe six? Or was it closer to eight? My husband… he used to keep track of things for me. I’m not very good with dates, you see. It’s just… a blur, lately. I wish I could be more precise.
DOCTOR: Right. Months. And is this unsteadiness constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It comes and goes. Definitely not constant. Some days I feel perfectly normal, and other days… well, like this morning, getting out of the car was a bit of a struggle. It’s not a fall-down kind of unsteady, more like… I have to really concentrate on where I’m putting my feet. And sometimes things seem to… spin, just a little. But not like a proper dizzy spell, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: “Spin, just a little.” So, not a full rotation, then. And does anything specific trigger these episodes?
PATIENT: No, not that I've noticed. It doesn't seem to be related to anything I do, or where I am. It’s just… random. I work out on the oil rigs, you know, a lot of physical activity, and it doesn’t happen during that, thankfully. It’s more… when I’m resting, or walking normally. Which is… unsettling. I don’t understand why it would happen, if I’m not doing anything strenuous.
DOCTOR: Oil rigs, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, rotary drill operator. It’s… demanding work. Lots of… well, lots of everything. It keeps me busy, though. I used to enjoy it very much. My husband… he worried about me, of course. Said it was too dangerous, but I… I needed to keep occupied. It’s hard to explain. He always said I was too independent for my own good.
DOCTOR: Right. And let’s focus on the medical aspect, shall we?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. Sorry. It’s just… things have been a bit… difficult, since he passed. It’s hard to think straight sometimes. The unsteadiness, as you said. It’s… worrying me, because I need to be steady at work. It’s not safe otherwise. Is there anything I should be… concerned about? Anything serious it could be?
DOCTOR: We'll need to rule out a few things. Let's start with your medical history. Any prior illnesses?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That's… difficult. I don’t really remember having any serious illnesses. I had the usual childhood things, I suppose. Measles, mumps… nothing major. My husband always handled the doctor’s appointments and kept track of everything. He said I worried too much about medical details. I… I had a bad fall once, years ago, broke my wrist. But that healed properly, I think. I haven't been to a doctor in… a long time, honestly. Perhaps five years? Or more. I truly can't recall.
DOCTOR: Alright. Any surgeries?
PATIENT: Um… let me think. Just the wrist, I believe. When I was younger. A simple break, nothing complicated. They put it in a cast, and it healed. It wasn’t… a major operation, if that makes sense. No other surgeries that I can remember. My husband… he would know for sure. He kept all the paperwork. It's all… somewhere, I suppose. After he… passed… things got a bit disorganized.
DOCTOR: And any allergies?
PATIENT: Oh, allergies… I don't think so. I haven’t ever had a reaction to anything, not that I recall. Sometimes my skin gets a little itchy, but that’s usually just from the dry air on the rig. Nothing serious. I don't carry an EpiPen or anything like that. My husband always said I was very fortunate to have a strong constitution. I suppose I always believed him. It’s… frustrating that I can’t remember things properly. It feels like my mind is… slipping away.
DOCTOR: Any medications currently?
PATIENT: No, none at all. I don't take anything regularly. Never have, really. My husband used to take something for his blood pressure, but… well, that’s besides the point. I don’t have any prescriptions, or anything like that. I prefer to avoid medication if possible. I believe in… natural remedies, mostly. Though I haven't found anything that helps with this unsteadiness, unfortunately.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s have a quick look at you. Please, have a seat and we’ll do a brief neurological exam.
PATIENT: Oh, very well. A neurological exam, you say? Yes, of course. I hope I won’t be too clumsy. It’s… a little unnerving, being examined. But if it helps, I’m happy to cooperate. Just let me know if there’s anything I need to do.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Snerling. I'm going to check your reflexes. Relax your legs. Patellar reflexes are 2+ bilaterally. Achilles reflexes are also 2+ bilaterally. Now, follow my finger with your eyes. Cranial nerves II-XII grossly intact. Can you close your eyes and tell me what I am doing with this. Sensation intact to light touch, pain, and temperature. Proprioception appears intact. Now stand, and walk a straight line for me. Gait is slightly unsteady, but no significant ataxia noted. Romberg test negative.
PATIENT: Oh, my. That’s… a little startling. Yes, I can feel that. Yes, I feel that. That's… cool. Oh dear. This is… difficult. It feels a bit wobbly, as you can see. I’m trying my best to stay steady. It’s… harder than it looks. I think I’m walking in a straight line, but it’s not very graceful, I’m afraid. I’m focusing very hard on keeping my balance. There. I believe that’s a straight line, more or less. Is that alright?
DOCTOR: Alright. Given your history and the exam findings, it's difficult to pinpoint a definitive cause at this time. It could be related to inner ear issues, or perhaps mild proprioceptive deficits. However, given your work environment, we also need to consider possible exposure to toxins or subtle head trauma.
PATIENT: Oh dear. Toxins or head trauma? That sounds… concerning. I mean, it is a rough environment, you’re right. Lots of noise, and things falling around… I haven’t had any major injuries, not that I recall, but… bumps and scrapes, certainly. And the fumes… we wear masks, of course, but still… Is that serious? What does that mean, exactly? And what can be done about it? I need to be able to continue working, you see. It’s… important.
DOCTOR: Look, Ms. Snerling, I’m not going to speculate. But given the potential for subtle neurological effects from your work, I recommend an MRI of the brain to rule out any structural abnormalities. And I’d like you to see an ENT specialist to evaluate your inner ear function. As for continuing to work, I can't advise that until we have more information. But you should be extremely cautious and report any changes in your condition to your employer. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Oh. An MRI… and an ENT specialist. Yes, I… I understand. It sounds… rather serious. Is it something terrible? I mean, is it likely to be something… bad? And an MRI… is that painful? I’ve never had one before. I suppose I should contact my insurance… This is all rather overwhelming. And I do need to continue working, as you said. I’m the sole provider, you see. What if… what if I can’t work? What do I do then? This is… a great deal to take in.
DOCTOR: Look, Ms. Snerling, I understand you're anxious. But I’m not going to speculate on the results before we have them. An MRI is not painful, it's just loud. As for your work, that's not a medical question. I'm referring you for further evaluation. I'll write you a referral to a neurologist and ENT specialist. Their offices will contact you to schedule appointments. Here’s a list of specialists who accept your insurance. I also recommend you consult with a financial advisor regarding your employment situation. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: Oh. No. I… I think that’s all. Thank you. Thank you for your time. I… I suppose I’ll contact these specialists. It’s… a great deal to process. Thank you.
