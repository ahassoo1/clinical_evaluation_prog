DOCTOR: Hi Triana, welcome to the clinic. It’s nice to meet you. I’m Dr. Maskal. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Look, I don’t have a lot of time for this. It’s my stomach. Been…well, it’s been a mess for weeks now. I’ve tried everything the drugstore has, and nothing’s working. I just want it fixed.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. “A mess” can mean a lot of things, so let’s try to narrow it down. When you say weeks, roughly how long?
PATIENT: Honestly? I don’t keep track of days. Maybe…three weeks? Four? It’s been long enough that I’m starting to lose weight, and frankly, I’m tired of being stuck inside. It’s diarrhea, Doctor. Constant diarrhea. Is there anything you can actually do about it, or am I just wasting my time?
DOCTOR: Alright, constant diarrhea for three to four weeks – that is concerning, especially with the weight loss. We definitely want to figure this out. Before we jump to conclusions, can you describe the diarrhea itself?
PATIENT: What do you mean, “describe it”? It’s…watery. And frequent. Like, really frequent. It’s not…bloody or anything, if that's what you're getting at. Just…a lot of it. Honestly, it's embarrassing even talking about it. Is that really necessary to go into detail about?
DOCTOR: No, you’re right, we don’t need to get overly graphic. Just confirming no blood is good. And frequency is helpful – roughly how many times a day are you going to the bathroom?
PATIENT: Look, it varies. Some days it’s…eight times. Other days, maybe six. It's constant, remember? It’s not like a normal stomach thing where you go a few times and it’s over. It’s just…always there, looming. And I’m already late getting back to work, so could we speed this up? I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Okay, eight times a day is significant. And I apologize for the delay – I want to make sure I get a good understanding of what’s going on so we can get you feeling better quickly. Have you noticed any other symptoms alongside the diarrhea?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Let me think…I’ve been tired, obviously. Who wouldn’t be, with all this? And…my stomach cramps a bit. Not constantly, but sometimes. And…I haven’t been very hungry. Which, honestly, is probably good because…well, you know. It doesn't stay in there very long, if you catch my drift. That’s it. No fever, no vomiting. Just…this mess.
DOCTOR: Okay, tiredness, cramping, and loss of appetite – those all fit. Let’s talk about your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, like Irritable Bowel Syndrome, Crohn’s disease, or anything else involving your digestive system?
PATIENT: No. I’ve never had any of those fancy…syndromes. I’m a pretty healthy person, usually. I eat okay, I don’t smoke, I drink…sometimes. This is just…out of the blue. My husband…my late husband, he always said I had an iron stomach. Obviously, that's not true now. But I've never been sick like this.
DOCTOR: I’m very sorry to hear about your husband. That must be incredibly difficult. And it’s good to know you haven’t had any previous digestive issues. Have you had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No surgeries. Look, are we getting anywhere with this? I feel like you’re just asking a lot of pointless questions. I told you, it’s diarrhea. Constant, horrible diarrhea. What kind of tests are you going to do? Are you going to give me something that actually works? I've got a business to run, I don't have time for endless examinations.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Triana. I apologize if it feels like I'm asking a lot of questions, but it's important to rule out different possibilities and ensure I'm providing the best care. I promise we'll get to a plan soon. Before we talk about tests, could you tell me about your medications and any allergies you have?
PATIENT: Medications? Just a multivitamin, occasionally. And allergies…dust, mostly. Nothing serious. Look, I'm not a complicated case. I just need something to stop this. I haven’t been this miserable in years. Are you going to ask me what I had for breakfast next? Honestly.
DOCTOR: No, I won’t ask about breakfast. Just confirming – multivitamin only, and a dust allergy. Okay. And, just to be thorough, what about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history? Really? Are you serious? My mother had high blood pressure. My father…he worked in a cannery, so probably some lung problems. That’s it. Everyone on both sides lived to be pretty old, mostly. No one had…stomach troubles or anything. Are we done yet? I have paint to apply. A client is expecting me. This is ridiculous.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known family history of digestive issues. Okay. Let's do a quick physical exam. I'm going to listen to your abdomen and check for any tenderness. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Fine. But make it quick. I really don't have time for this. And try not to poke too hard. I'm already uncomfortable enough as it is. Just…get it over with.
DOCTOR: Okay, just relaxing your abdomen for me. Deep breaths in and out… Sounds are…hyperactive. Which is consistent with diarrhea. Now, I’m going to gently press on your abdomen to check for any tenderness. There’s some mild tenderness in the lower abdomen, but no significant guarding or rebound tenderness. Tympanic to percussion. No distention. Overall, the exam is relatively benign, but the hyperactive bowel sounds and tenderness warrant further investigation.
PATIENT: Ow! That’s a little sore, yes. See? I told you it was bad. What does that even mean, “hyperactive”? Does that mean I have worms? I knew I should have boiled the water on that camping trip. Honestly. What are you going to do now? Just tell me what tests you want to do, and let’s get it over with. I have a client waiting, you know. They aren't going to wait forever.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand your concern. “Hyperactive” just means your bowels are moving very quickly, which is consistent with what you’re experiencing. And no, it doesn’t necessarily mean you have worms, though that's something we can rule out. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order a few tests. A stool sample to check for bacteria, parasites, and blood. Also, a complete blood count to see if you're anemic, which can happen with prolonged diarrhea, and a basic metabolic panel to check your electrolytes. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: More tests. Of course. Just…get it done. I guess. What do I even do with a stool sample? Do I have to bring it in myself? This is absolutely ridiculous. Fine, whatever. Just tell me where to go, and let’s hurry it up. My time is valuable.
DOCTOR: Okay. I'll have the nurse give you the collection kit and instructions for the stool sample. You'll need to collect a small amount of stool in the container and bring it to the lab as soon as possible. The nurse will also give you the requisition form for the blood work. You can go to the lab in the same building – they’re open until 5 pm today. The results typically take 24-48 hours. In the meantime, I want you to focus on staying hydrated with electrolytes. I can prescribe an oral rehydration solution, if you’d like.
PATIENT: Fine. Electrolytes. Whatever. Just give me the kit and get me out of here. I'll go do the tests. Don't bother with the rehydration solution, I'll buy some sports drinks. Honestly, this whole thing is a waste of my time, but…fine. Just…get it over with. I'm going to get that kit. Let's not waste any more time. .
DOCTOR: Alright, the nurse will be right with you. And please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. We’ll get to the bottom of this, Triana. Thank you for your patience. .
