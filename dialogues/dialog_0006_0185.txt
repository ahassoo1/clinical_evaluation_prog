DOCTOR: Alright, Zelina, good to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Look, can we just get this over with? It's my breath. It smells bad. Really bad. Honestly, it's embarrassing. I don't need a whole life story asked of me, just… fix it.
DOCTOR: Okay, okay. Bad breath… happens. We can definitely take a look. It’s good to know what’s been going on, even if it's just briefly, to rule things out. But we'll try and keep it quick, alright?
PATIENT: Rule things out? What things? Look, I work on the highway. It's dirty. Maybe it's that? I don’t have time for a bunch of questions about my… personal life. I just need something to mask it, or whatever. Do you have something strong?
DOCTOR: Right, highway work...dust, fumes, all sorts of things. It could be that, absolutely. But sometimes bad breath…halitosis…can point to other things. Just a quick check to be safe. Before we go for a mask, I want to rule out anything serious. Have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Like what? I'm not a doctor, you know. I just know my breath smells like…well, like the highway sometimes. Look, I'm divorced, okay? My ex complained a lot. Is that a symptom? I'm not sure what you want me to say.
DOCTOR: No, divorce isn't a symptom, Zelina. Sorry, that was… a bit personal. I just need to get a feel for things. Okay, let's focus on the breath. Any pain in your teeth?
PATIENT: Pain? No. Look, I had a filling a couple years back, but it hasn’t bothered me. Everything feels… normal. I just want something to get rid of the smell. Is that really so hard? I mean, you're a doctor. Shouldn't you have something for this?
DOCTOR: Alright, no tooth pain, filling a couple years ago. Okay. Let’s take a quick look in your mouth, just to check things out. Open wide for me, please.
PATIENT: Ugh, fine. But hurry. I have a lunch break, you know. Just get it over with.
DOCTOR: Okay…teeth look generally healthy, no obvious cavities. Gums are a little…inflamed, maybe a slight redness. Do you brush and floss regularly?
PATIENT: Regularly? Look, I brush when I can. Floss? Sometimes. It's not exactly easy when you're covered in dirt all day. I’m a highway worker, not a… a dental model. Are you judging me? Because if you are…
DOCTOR: No, no judgement, Zelina. Just trying to get a picture. Inflamed gums can definitely contribute to bad breath. It looks like you may have some early gingivitis. It’s not uncommon, especially with…certain lifestyles. Let's talk about oral hygiene first. What kind of toothbrush do you use?
PATIENT: A toothbrush? A normal one! What, is there some special toothbrush I'm supposed to have? I get them from the dollar store. Look, I don’t have time for this. I'm not exactly rolling in money, okay? Just tell me what will fix the smell. A stronger mouthwash? Something?
DOCTOR: Okay, a regular toothbrush is fine. But let’s talk technique. Are you brushing for at least two minutes, twice a day?
PATIENT: Two minutes? Seriously? Who has time for that? Look, I brush it quickly, get the food bits out, and I’m done. I have things to do. I'm not sitting there timing myself like it’s some kind of competition. Is this really necessary?
DOCTOR: Alright. Look, I understand you're busy. But proper brushing is key. We can start with that. And a good antibacterial mouthwash, used twice daily, would help. I recommend one with chlorhexidine, but it can stain teeth with long-term use. Let’s try one without chlorhexidine first. I'll write you a prescription for a generic brand. It shouldn’t be too expensive. And I'm going to recommend a visit to a dentist in the next few weeks. They can give you a proper cleaning and check for anything else going on. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: A dentist? Ugh. Fine. Whatever. Just give me the prescription. I don’t want to spend more money on this than I have to. And honestly, if this mouthwash doesn't work, I'm not sure what I'm going to do. Is that it? Can I go now?
DOCTOR: Alright, here's the prescription. The mouthwash should help with the bacterial buildup. If it doesn't improve after a week, please schedule an appointment with a dentist. And, to be clear, if you experience any jaw pain, difficulty breathing or swallowing, please seek medical attention immediately. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: No. That's it. Just…thank you. Honestly, this was a waste of time. .
