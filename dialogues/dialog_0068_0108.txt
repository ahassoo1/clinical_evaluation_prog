DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Gentz. I'm Dr. Sham. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Yeah, well, it's this… bleeding. Not a good time for it, let me tell ya. Been happenin' a few times now. Don't need this on top of everything else.
DOCTOR: Okay. Bleeding… can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: What do you mean, more? It’s blood, alright? Comin’ from… down there. Look, I’m not one for details, Doc. It’s… unpleasant. Enough to make a fella feel weak, is what I'm sayin'. And it smells. Really smells. It’s not like a little scrape, okay? It’s… significant.
DOCTOR: Right, significant bleeding. I understand you’re not comfortable with details, and that's perfectly alright. But to help me understand what's going on, could you tell me when it started?
PATIENT: Hmm… when did it start? Let me think. It was… after my wife passed. Definitely after. Maybe a month or so? Everything kinda blurred together after… well, you know. It wasn't constant, though. Started happening on and off. Now it's… more on than off, if you catch my drift. Why does it matter when exactly? Is it somethin' I ate?
DOCTOR: It matters because timing can sometimes point to the cause. And no, it’s unlikely to be something you ate, Mr. Gentz. We need to figure out where the bleeding is coming from. Is it from the rectum?
PATIENT: The… what now? Rectum? You gotta use plain English, Doc. I ain't a doctor. You mean… the butt? Is that what you’re askin'? Yes. It’s comin’ from… there. Don't look at me like that. It’s embarrassing enough as it is, you know. Honestly, you people… all these fancy words.
DOCTOR: I apologize, Mr. Gentz. I didn't mean to be insensitive. Rectum is just the medical term for the… well, you got it. And you are right to be concerned. Okay. Has the stool color changed at all?
PATIENT: Changed? Like what? Is it supposed to be a certain color? I haven’t been payin’ much attention to my… business, Doc. Honestly, I just try to get it over with. It's dark, I guess. Darkish. Like… regular. Or maybe a little blacker. I dunno. Look, I'm a simple man. Don't ask me to be a stool expert. Is this gonna take long? I got things to do.
DOCTOR: Dark or black stool is something we need to pay attention to. It can indicate bleeding higher up in the digestive tract. Okay. Have you experienced any pain, cramping, or discomfort along with the bleeding?
PATIENT: Pain… sometimes. Not like a sharp, stabbin’ pain. More of a… dull ache. Low down. And yeah, cramping. Especially before… you know. It kinda feels like… gas pains, but worse. It doesn’t last long, usually. Just kinda comes and goes. I just figured it was somethin' I ate, honestly. Everything’s a mess these days, anyway. Can’t trust nothin’.
DOCTOR: Alright. And how often would you say this is happening now, Mr. Gentz?
PATIENT: How often… let me think. It used to be once a week, maybe. Now? Three, four times a week, easy. Sometimes more. It’s gettin' worse, Doc. That's why I’m here, isn't it? I can’t keep changin’ my clothes every other day. It's… demoralizing, to be honest. A man shouldn't have to deal with this. Especially not after… everything.
DOCTOR: Okay. Mr. Gentz, given the frequency and the dark stool, I need to do a quick physical exam. I'll need to check your abdomen and then do a rectal exam. It won't be pleasant, but it’s important to get a better idea of what’s going on. Do you understand?
PATIENT: A… what now? You want to look at it? No. Absolutely not. I told you, I ain’t comfortable with details. I came here to get a pill, maybe, not to be… prodded. I'm a grown man, Doc. You can’t just go around lookin' at… things. I don’t like this. Not one bit. Is there anything else you can do? A scan? A test? Anything besides… that.
DOCTOR: I understand your discomfort, Mr. Gentz. A physical exam is the most direct way to gather information right now. While scans can be helpful, they don't always provide a clear picture and don’t rule out everything. However, we can start with a stool test to check for blood. It’s non-invasive. And… I can document your refusal of the physical exam. But I strongly recommend we proceed with the exam to get a more accurate assessment. If the stool test comes back negative, we may need to consider a referral to a gastroenterologist for further evaluation. Would you be willing to at least agree to the stool test?
PATIENT: A stool test… okay. Fine. A stool test. That I can handle. As long as you don’t expect me to… collect it here. I’m not bringin’ a sample to the doctor’s office, alright? I’ll… I’ll do it at home. But that’s it. No pokin' and proddin’. Got it? And make sure you tell me exactly how to do it. I’m not a scientist. Just… get it over with. This is humiliating enough.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Gentz. I understand. I’ll have the nurse give you a collection kit and detailed instructions. It's important to follow those instructions carefully. We'll need a small sample, collected on three separate days, if possible. Once you've collected the samples, you can bring them to the lab – the nurse will give you directions. I will also document your refusal of a physical exam at this time. Do you have any allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Allergies? Nah. I’m a tough guy. Dust, maybe. But that’s about it. I can handle a little dust. Look, just get me this kit. I wanna get this over with. I got things to do, you know? People expect things from me. I can’t be spendin’ all day in a doctor’s office over a little… blood. Although, it’s not really little anymore, is it? Nevermind. Just the kit. Please.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Gentz. I'll have the nurse bring that kit right in. While you’re waiting, I'll just ask a couple more quick questions. Are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications? Hmph. Just some aspirin when my knees act up. That’s it. And a little… something for sleep sometimes. Don’t judge me. It’s been a rough couple of years. It's nothing fancy, just… something to help me rest. Over the counter stuff. You know. Nothing the police need to worry about. Don’t write that down, either. It’s personal.
DOCTOR: Alright, aspirin and something for sleep, occasionally. I won’t put anything in your chart you’re not comfortable with. Just trying to get a complete picture, Mr. Gentz. And… before I let the nurse in, do you have any family history of bleeding disorders, colon cancer, or other digestive issues?
PATIENT: Family history… Well, my father… he always had a weak stomach. Couldn’t eat nothin’ without gettin’ sick. And my aunt, on my mother’s side… she had… something. Cancer, maybe. A long time ago. I don’t remember the details. They didn’t talk about it much. People didn’t talk about cancer back then. It was… shameful. Honestly, Doc, I don’t know. A lot of people get sick. I try not to dwell on it. It’s depressing enough as it is. Is this gonna be over soon?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Gentz. That's perfectly alright. I understand. I think we've covered the basics for now. I'll have the nurse bring in the stool collection kit and instructions. Please follow those instructions carefully. Once the results come back, we’ll discuss the next steps. If you experience any increased bleeding, severe abdominal pain, or dizziness, please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me before the nurse comes in?
PATIENT: No. Just… get me the kit. And try not to make a big deal out of it, alright? I just wanna get this over with. I got things to do. Things a man's gotta do. This is ridiculous. Absolutely ridiculous. .
