DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Popova. I’m Dr. Gorga. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning to you too, Doctor. Well, it’s this headache I’ve been havin’. Right at the back of me head, you know? Been botherin’ me for a bit now. Not constant, but it comes and goes, and when it does come, it’s a right nuisance.
DOCTOR: Hmm, okay. A headache at the back of the head… alright. And how long has this been going on for, roughly?
PATIENT: Let me see… Oh, must be… close to three weeks now, I reckon. Maybe a little longer. It started off kinda mild, I thought it was just tiredness, but it’s gotten a bit more noticeable lately. Doesn’t stop me from doin’ things, but it’s always there, niggling away.
DOCTOR: Right. Three weeks… and you said it’s not constant. Can you describe the pain a little more?
PATIENT: Well, it’s not like a sharp pain, not at all. More like a… a pressure, really. A dull ache, spread across the back of me head. Sometimes it feels a little tight, like somethin’s squeezin’. And it doesn’t shoot anywhere, stays right there at the back. It’s worst when I’m thinkin’ hard, or if I’m bendin’ over for too long, doin’ someone’s toes, you know? Bein’ a manicurist, I'm bendin' a lot!
DOCTOR: Okay, a pressure, dull ache, tight feeling… worse with concentration and bending. Do you notice anything else that makes it worse, or better?
PATIENT: Hmm... Let me see… Lying down seems to help a bit, yeah. And if I take a little rest, it fades. But nothin' really makes it go away completely, just takes the edge off. Strong light bothers it a little, I suppose. Not a terrible bother, mind you, but bright sunshine does seem to make it a bit more noticeable. And I ain't been sleepin' as well lately, if I'm honest. Just a little restless, tossin' and turnin'.
DOCTOR: Alright, so lying down helps, rest helps a bit, bright light makes it a bit worse, and you haven't been sleeping well. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms alongside the headache?
PATIENT: No, not really. No blurry vision, no dizziness, no numbness, no fevers… I haven’t been feelin’ sick to me stomach or anything like that either. Just the headache, and a bit of trouble gettin’ a good night’s sleep. Oh! And me wife says I’ve been a little more forgetful than usual, but at me age, what can you expect? Though I remember everything perfectly, mind you! It’s her who forgets things!
DOCTOR: Okay, no other symptoms… just the headache and sleep trouble. And a bit of forgetfulness, according to your wife. Do you have any medical conditions that you’re aware of?
PATIENT: No, not really. I've always been a healthy man, touch wood! Bit of high blood pressure a few years back, the doctor said, but it was nothin' serious. He put me on some pills for a while, but I stopped takin’ them after a bit, and he didn’t mind. Otherwise, just the usual aches and pains of gettin' old, you know? I don't see doctors often.
DOCTOR: Alright, a history of high blood pressure that was treated, but you're not currently on any medication. And no surgeries that you recall?
PATIENT: No, no surgeries at all. Never had the need for one, thankfully! Just the usual scrapes and bruises from workin' with me hands, but nothin' a bit of plasterin’ didn’t fix. I'm a simple man, Doctor. Not much trouble with me, usually. Just want to get this headache sorted, so I can keep doin' what I love.
DOCTOR: Okay. No surgeries. And no allergies to any medications or anything else you know of?
PATIENT: No, not that I'm aware of. Never had a bad reaction to anything. I can eat anything, drink anything, no problems at all. My wife always jokes I have a cast-iron stomach! She worries about me eatin' too much pepper, though. Says it makes me too lively! But no, no allergies.
DOCTOR: Alright. No allergies. Now, just a couple more questions. Family history… has anyone in your family suffered from frequent headaches, or any neurological conditions?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think… My mother used to get headaches now and again, but nothin' terrible. Just the usual tension headaches, I reckon. My father, he was a strong man, never sick a day in his life. No one in the family ever had anything serious, not that I know of. No stroke, no nothin’ like that. We weren’t much for talkin’ about health, back in me day. You had a pain, you dealt with it, and moved on.
DOCTOR: Okay, a history of occasional tension headaches in your mother. And lastly, what about your social habits?
PATIENT: Social habits? Oh, you mean like drinkin' and smokin'? No, no, I don't smoke, never have. And I don't drink much these days, just a small glass of wine with me dinner now and again. Nothin' heavy. I spend most of me time with me wife, tending to the garden, and workin', of course. I like to keep busy. A quiet life, really.
DOCTOR: Alright, so a quiet life, no smoking, minimal alcohol. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright. Just check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and do a quick neurological check. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that's fine. Go ahead, Doctor. Whatever you need to do to get to the bottom of this headache, I'm happy to let you. I trust your judgment.
DOCTOR: Alright. Blood pressure is a little elevated, 150/90. Not terribly high, but something we’ll keep an eye on. Heart sounds regular, lungs are clear. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes and strength. Please relax your arms… and tell me if you feel any pain. Strength appears normal in all extremities. Some slightly diminished reflexes, but that’s not uncommon at your age. Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light. No obvious visual deficits. Now, just a quick range of motion of your neck… gently turn your head to the left… and to the right… any pain with that?
PATIENT: No pain with that, Doctor. Just feels a little stiff, sometimes. Been sleepin’ on a new pillow lately, might be that. It’s not a sharp pain, just a little… tight. And a little clickin’ sound, sometimes, when I turn it. Me wife says I sound like an old radio! But no, no real pain.
DOCTOR: Okay, I'm feeling some tenderness in the muscles at the base of your skull. Seems like there's some muscle tension there. Based on what you've told me and the exam, it sounds like you're likely experiencing tension headaches, possibly exacerbated by some stiffness in your neck muscles. However, given your age and slightly elevated blood pressure, I’d like to be cautious.
PATIENT: That makes sense, Doctor. Me neck does feel a bit tight sometimes, especially after workin’ with someone’s feet all day. And me blood pressure, you say it’s a little high? I suppose I should be tryin’ to cut back on the salt, then. What do you think I should do about the headache? Is there anything I can take? And should I be worried about this tightness in me neck?
DOCTOR: Okay, so for the headache, I’m going to recommend over-the-counter ibuprofen or naproxen as needed for pain relief. Follow the dosage instructions on the bottle, and don't take it for more than a few days without talking to me. We can also consider a muscle relaxant if the neck stiffness is particularly bothersome, but I’d like to start with the ibuprofen first and see if that helps. As for the neck tightness, some gentle stretching exercises and warm compresses can be helpful. I'll have the nurse print you out a handout with some simple exercises. Regarding your blood pressure, yes, it's a little elevated. I’d like you to monitor it at home for a week, if you can. We'll also need to run some basic blood tests just to rule out any other underlying causes. And, just to be on the safe side, I think a CT scan of your head would be a good idea, to rule out anything more serious.
PATIENT: A CT scan, you say? Oh, dear. That sounds a bit… serious. Is it somethin’ you think I should be really worried about, Doctor? And these blood tests… what are you lookin’ for, exactly? I don't mind takin’ some pills, and I'll definitely try them stretches, but I'm not keen on too many tests, if I'm honest. I'm a simple man, you know? I just want to get rid of this headache and get back to workin'.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Popova. It's not that I'm expecting anything serious, but given your age and the fact that this headache is persistent, it's important to rule out any potential underlying causes. The CT scan is a precautionary measure. It’s a quick, painless scan, and it will give us a clear picture of your brain. As for the blood tests, we're just looking for things like infection, inflammation, and any imbalances that might be contributing to the headache. It's a standard procedure. I want to be thorough and make sure we're not missing anything. It's better to be safe than sorry, especially with something like your head. The vast majority of headaches are harmless, and I suspect yours is just tension related. But we need to rule out anything more serious before we can be certain. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Yes, I suppose that makes sense, Doctor. You’re right, it's better to be safe. I don’t like bein’ tested, but I trust your judgment. If you think it’s necessary, then I'll do it. So, what happens next? Do I need to make an appointment for these tests? And will the nurse print me out them stretches? I’ll try to keep track of me blood pressure, too. Hopefully, it won’t be too high.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I’m glad we could talk through this. Yes, the nurse will print you out the stretches and give you instructions on how to monitor your blood pressure. We’ll also schedule you for the blood tests and the CT scan. The blood tests can be done here at the clinic tomorrow morning, and we’ll schedule the CT scan for later next week. Once we have the results, we’ll review them together and discuss the best course of action. In the meantime, try the ibuprofen if needed, and focus on gentle stretching and rest. If your headache gets significantly worse, or if you develop any new symptoms like fever, vision changes, or weakness, please call the clinic immediately. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything, Doctor. You've explained everything very clearly, and I appreciate you takin’ the time to listen to me. I'll try to stay positive and follow your instructions. Hopefully, it’s just a bit of tension, like you said. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Popova. I’m glad I could help. Don't hesitate to call if you have any concerns at all. The nurse will be in shortly to review the instructions and schedule your tests. Take care, and I’ll see you next week.
PATIENT: .
