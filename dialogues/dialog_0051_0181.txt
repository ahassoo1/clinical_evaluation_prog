DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Mombrun. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Glazewski. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you too. As I mentioned to the receptionist, I scheduled this visit simply for a general check-up. I like to keep tabs on things, you see. Just a wellness panel, if you will. Preventative maintenance, I always say. Though I confess, I don't always understand all the numbers they give you afterwards – that’s why I scheduled time with you.
DOCTOR: That's very wise, Mr. Mombrun. Preventative care is excellent. And we're happy to help you understand any results. A general wellness panel is a great place to start. Before we get to ordering anything, if you don’t mind, I like to gather a little bit of your medical history first. It helps me get a more complete picture. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. No problem at all. Ask away. I have a fairly straightforward history, I believe, but I’m happy to share whatever information you need. I’ve been quite fortunate with my health, all things considered. Perhaps you’d like to start with my family? My mother lived to be ninety-seven, a very robust woman. My father...well, he had some trouble with his heart later in life.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful to hear about your mother’s longevity, Mr. Mombrun. And thank you for sharing about your father. Heart trouble…do you happen to recall what specifically he was diagnosed with, if you know?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think… it was quite a few years ago now. I believe the doctor used the term “congestive heart failure,” though truthfully, I didn’t grasp all the details at the time. He had a good deal of swelling in his legs and found it increasingly difficult to breathe, especially when he exerted himself. He was quite a strong man before that, a carpenter by trade. He ended up needing a pacemaker, and then…well, then his time came. It was peaceful, thankfully. He was eighty-two.
DOCTOR: I see. That gives me a helpful starting point, thank you. And you mentioned he was a carpenter – a physically demanding job. Do you have any family history of diabetes, high blood pressure, or any other significant illnesses on either side of the family?
PATIENT: Yes, you’re right to ask. My aunt, my mother’s sister, suffered with diabetes for many years. She had to have her foot amputated, a very sad situation. And my uncle, on my father’s side, had high blood pressure. He wasn’t particularly diligent about watching his diet, I’m afraid, and it eventually led to a stroke. Otherwise, thankfully, we’ve been a fairly healthy bunch. A lot of robust constitutions, I’d say. Though, as you know, genetics are only part of the story. I’ve always tried to be mindful of my lifestyle.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Mr. Mombrun. Diabetes and hypertension are important factors. It sounds like you are very aware of your health risks. Now, turning to you personally, have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I haven't. Not a one. I’ve been remarkably lucky in that regard. I had the usual childhood illnesses – measles, mumps, chickenpox – but nothing serious. I broke my arm once falling from a mango tree as a boy, a rather silly accident, but it healed cleanly. And I had my appendix removed in my twenties, a routine operation. Aside from that… perfectly healthy, I assure you. I take good care of myself, eat well, and get plenty of exercise. Mostly gardening, these days. It keeps me active and provides fresh vegetables for my wife, Elena. She’s a wonderful cook.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent to hear, Mr. Mombrun. Gardening is wonderful exercise, and a healthy lifestyle is invaluable. So, appendectomy in your twenties…were there any complications with that surgery?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, none at all. It was quite straightforward, thankfully. I was in the hospital for a few days, and then back to normal. The doctor said I was lucky it hadn’t burst. I remember being quite unwell for a day or two beforehand, a rather sharp pain in my abdomen, but the surgery resolved it quickly. It was many years ago, of course. I don't recall the name of the surgeon now. I don’t make a habit of dwelling on unpleasantness. But it was a clean recovery, and I’ve had no problems with it since.
DOCTOR: Good, that’s reassuring. And just to complete the picture, are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not a single one. I prefer to get my nutrients from whole foods whenever possible. Elena, my wife, is quite insistent on it. She makes a lovely smoothie every morning with all sorts of fruits and vegetables. It's quite delicious, though I sometimes grumble about the kale. She says it’s good for me, and I trust her judgement. Aside from that, I take nothing. Just good food, plenty of water, and a little bit of sunshine. I believe in keeping things simple.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful, Mr. Mombrun. A healthy diet is certainly a good foundation. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, none that I am aware of. I've never had a reaction to anything. I've eaten all sorts of things throughout my life, traveled to many countries, and never experienced an allergic response. I've even been stung by a few bees while gardening, though that was just a bit of discomfort, not a full-blown allergy. Elena, again, is quite vigilant about checking labels, just in case. But to date, I’ve been fortunate enough to have no allergies whatsoever. A blessing, really.
DOCTOR: That's excellent, Mr. Mombrun. It sounds like you and Elena have a very healthy lifestyle and a good system in place. Now, before we move onto a physical exam, could you tell me a little about your social history?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. What would you like to know? I've been happily married to Elena for forty-two years now. We met in Caracas, where I was working as a construction foreman. She was a teacher, a very lovely woman, even then. We have two grown children, a son and a daughter, both happily married with children of their own. We have five grandchildren, a source of great joy in our lives. I retired about five years ago, which allows me to spend more time with my family and in my garden. I don't smoke, and I only drink a glass of wine with dinner occasionally. I consider myself a social person, enjoying the company of friends and family. Is there anything specific you're interested in?
DOCTOR: That sounds like a very fulfilling life, Mr. Mombrun. Congratulations on your long and happy marriage, and on the growing family. Just a couple more questions, if you don’t mind. Have you ever used recreational drugs, or do you have a history of excessive alcohol consumption?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, never. Not a single time. I was raised with a strong sense of morality, and I've always avoided such things. And as for alcohol, I enjoy a glass of wine with dinner occasionally, as I mentioned, but I've never been one for excessive drinking. I find it interferes with my sleep, and I prefer to wake up feeling clear-headed. I’ve always preferred a good cup of coffee, frankly. A little bit of caffeine to get me going in the morning. But that's the extent of it. I've always been a moderate person, I suppose. It’s served me well, all these years.
DOCTOR: Excellent, Mr. Mombrun. That provides a very complete picture of your history. Now, I’d like to perform a brief physical exam, if you’re comfortable with that. It will involve listening to your heart and lungs, checking your blood pressure, and a general examination. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Yes, please. I have no objections whatsoever. I trust your expertise. Go ahead, whenever you’re ready. I’ve always been a proponent of regular check-ups. Better to be safe than sorry, as they say. I’ll do whatever you need me to do. Just let me know if there’s anything I should be doing. And thank you for taking the time to listen to my rather long-winded history.
DOCTOR: Not at all, Mr. Mombrun. It’s my pleasure, and a thorough history is vital. Alright, let’s start by listening to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath for me…and exhale slowly. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs noted. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Blood pressure is 130/80, which is within the normal range. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, and non-distended. No masses or organomegaly appreciated. Pulses are strong and regular in all extremities. Skin is warm, dry, and intact. No rashes or lesions noted. Overall, physical exam is unremarkable. Everything sounds and looks good, Mr. Mombrun. However, as a preventative measure, I’d still like to order a comprehensive metabolic panel, a lipid panel, and a complete blood count. Does that sound agreeable?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly reasonable. Preventative measures are always a good idea. I appreciate your thoroughness. A comprehensive panel, a lipid panel, and a blood count – yes, please. Whatever you think is best. Just let me know when and where I need to go to have the blood drawn. And thank you again for your time and attention. You've put my mind at ease. Now, about those numbers…is there anything I can do to prepare, or should I just show up?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Mombrun. Glad I could reassure you. As for the blood draw, you can eat and drink normally beforehand – no special preparation is required. The lab is just down the hall, room 203. They're open until 5 pm today, or you can schedule an appointment for tomorrow if that’s more convenient. Once we have the results, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them in detail. In the meantime, continue with your healthy lifestyle – it's clearly serving you well. Are there any questions you have for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I believe that covers everything. You’ve been very helpful and informative. Elena will be pleased to hear everything went smoothly. I do appreciate your patience with my long-winded explanations. And thank you again for explaining the need for the blood work. I sometimes feel a bit overwhelmed by medical jargon, but you explained it very clearly. I think I'm all set for now. Perhaps I'll see you next week to discuss the results. Thank you, Doctor Glazewski.
