DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Rover. I’m Dr. Pitmon. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Uh… well, it’s about… long-term care, I think? My… someone said I needed to get checked out for it. My wife… she handled most things. It’s been a while since she… passed. I just want to make sure everything’s okay, you know? For the future.
DOCTOR: Right, I understand. “Long-term care check-up.” That’s… vague, but we can certainly work with that. It's good you're being proactive. When your wife passed… how long ago was that, Mr. Rover?
PATIENT: Oh, gosh. A few years now. I… I don’t remember exactly. Maybe… three? Four? Time gets away from you. It feels like a long time, but… not long enough, if that makes sense. It was sudden, a heart thing. She was always healthy, though.
DOCTOR: Three or four years… alright. And you’re feeling generally well yourself, currently?
PATIENT: Yeah, I guess so. A little tired, maybe? Old age, I reckon. I do some work down at the docks, moving things around. Keeps me busy. Nothing feels broken, if you know what I mean. Just… slow. And forgetful. Always been a bit that way, but it's worse now, I think.
DOCTOR: “A little tired” and “a little forgetful.” Right. So, the fatigue… is that constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It’s mostly at the end of the day. After a long shift down at the docks. But sometimes… even in the morning, I feel like I haven't slept. It's hard to explain. Like I used all my energy just… existing. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It does, Mr. Rover. That's helpful. Now, let’s talk about this forgetfulness a bit more. Can you give me an example of something you've forgotten recently?
PATIENT: Oh, boy. Um… yesterday, I went to the store for milk. Got there, wandered around for a good ten minutes… couldn't remember why I was there. Had to go home and check the fridge. Little things like that. Sometimes I forget names, too. People I’ve known for years. It’s embarrassing.
DOCTOR: Right. Okay. And has this been a gradual thing, this worsening memory, or did it seem to happen relatively suddenly?
PATIENT: Gradual, I think. It's been getting worse for… well, probably since my wife got sick, to be honest. I was so worried about her, I probably wasn't paying attention to myself. It’s just… harder now. Used to be able to juggle things. Now, I feel like I'm dropping balls all the time.
DOCTOR: Alright. And aside from the fatigue and memory issues, are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… not that I can think of. No pain, no dizziness… I eat okay, I guess. Maybe a little less than I used to. Just… not much appetite sometimes. And… I get a little… frustrated. Easy to get annoyed, quicker than I used to be. But that could just be the forgetting.
DOCTOR: Mr. Rover, I’m going to ask a few more questions, just to get a fuller picture. This is routine, alright?
PATIENT: Okay, that's fine. Ask away, Doctor. I'll do my best to answer.
DOCTOR: Have you noticed any changes in your vision recently?
PATIENT: Vision… huh. Now that you mention it… things seem a little blurry sometimes. I just figured it was my age, you know? I haven’t been to the eye doctor in… well, a long time. Maybe a couple of years? It's not bad, just not as sharp as it used to be.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your hearing?
PATIENT: Hearing’s okay, I think. My wife used to complain I didn’t listen to her enough, but that wasn’t my ears, I swear! But seriously, I haven’t noticed any trouble hearing lately. Everything sounds normal. Though… sometimes the TV is a little loud. I always liked it loud.
DOCTOR: Right. Okay. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any chronic conditions – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease?
PATIENT: Let me think… My wife… she had the blood pressure. I never did. I had a bad knee when I was younger, playing football, but that's been fixed. And… oh! I had pneumonia once, a long time ago. But other than that… not really. Just the usual colds and flu. I don't think so.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Just the knee, like I said. A long time ago. When I was still working construction. It healed up fine. Nothing else. No, that’s it. I avoided the doctors as much as possible. Always figured I was tough enough to get through things on my own.
DOCTOR: Okay. And what about medications?
PATIENT: Just a little something for my knee when it flares up, sometimes. Ibuprofen, I think? Over the counter stuff. Nothing regular. I don’t like taking pills if I can avoid it. That’s about it.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, I'm going to do a quick physical exam. Just checking your reflexes, listening to your heart and lungs, that sort of thing. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, sure. That's fine. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. I’m ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s start with your blood pressure. Just relax your arm… good. Your heart rate is a little elevated, but nothing alarming. Lungs are clear. Now, let’s check your reflexes… Alright. Your strength seems good. Now, I’m going to check your cranial nerves… Follow my finger with your eyes… good. Okay. Memory… can you tell me today’s date?
PATIENT: Uh… August… the second? Yeah, August the second. 2025, right? I think. It’s hard to keep track sometimes.
DOCTOR: Alright. And can you repeat these three words for me: apple, table, penny?
PATIENT: Apple… table… penny. Apple, table, penny. Did I get them right?
DOCTOR: Yes, you did. Now, I’m going to ask you a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: No, sir. Never have. My wife hated it, and… well, it just didn't seem worth it. Never been a smoker.
DOCTOR: Do you drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Not much. A beer with dinner sometimes, maybe on the weekends. Nothing heavy. I don't really have a sweet tooth for it, you know? It's not really a habit.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your diet?
PATIENT: Well, I try to eat healthy. Fish when I can get it, lots of vegetables. My wife… she was a good cook. She always made sure we had a balanced meal. I… I haven't been as good at it since she passed. It's just… easier to grab something quick. But I try. Mostly.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Rover. Based on what you’ve told me and the quick exam, it's difficult to say definitively what's going on. Your symptoms – fatigue, forgetfulness, changes in appetite, and mild difficulty with recall – could be due to a number of things. It could be related to stress and grief from your wife’s passing. It could also be early signs of cognitive decline. We need to do some further testing to rule things out. I’d like to order a full blood panel, including a thyroid check. I also recommend a CT scan of your brain to rule out any structural problems. And finally, I’d like to refer you to a neurologist for a more in-depth cognitive assessment. Do that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: That… that sounds like a lot. A CT scan? Is it… is it serious? I just want to make sure I'm okay. I don't want anything… bad. But if you think it's necessary, I guess. It's just… a lot to take in. A neurologist too? What are you looking for, exactly?
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Rover. It does sound like a lot, and I wouldn't recommend it if I didn't think it was important. The CT scan is just a precaution, to rule out things like strokes or tumors. It’s a quick and painless procedure. And the neurologist is a specialist in brain health – they can perform more detailed tests to assess your memory and cognitive function. We’re not looking for anything bad, per se. We’re just being thorough. It could be something as simple as a vitamin deficiency, or stress, as I mentioned. But it's important to rule out anything more serious. I'll also order a depression screening, as grief can manifest in many ways. Would you be comfortable with those tests?
PATIENT: I… okay. If you think it’s best. It’s just… it’s a lot to handle. My wife always took care of these things. I never had to worry about it before. A depression screening… well, I do feel sad sometimes. I guess. Yes. Okay. Let’s do the tests. But… how long will it take? And what if… what if it is something bad?
DOCTOR: I understand your worry, Mr. Rover. We'll take it one step at a time. The blood work can be done today, and the results should be back in a few days. The CT scan will need to be scheduled, and that can take a week or so. As for the neurologist, I’ll get the referral sent over and they’ll contact you to schedule an appointment. We’ll discuss the results of each test as we get them, and I'll explain everything in detail. And remember, Mr. Rover, even if it is something serious, there are treatments available. We’ll explore all our options together. In the meantime, I’m going to give you a list of resources for grief counseling and support groups. It’s okay to ask for help, and it’s important to take care of your emotional wellbeing. Now, let’s get the paperwork started for the blood work. Then I'll have the nurse come in and draw the samples. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes. Alright. That sounds… good. Thank you, Doctor. Paperwork first, then the blood work. Okay. Just… let me know if anything is… bad. As soon as you know. .
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Rover. I will. We’ll be in touch as soon as we have the results. Please don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. The nurse will be in shortly. And remember, you're not alone in this.
