DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Mr. Reyno. I’m Dr. Yackey. Now, let's not waste any time. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Uh, yeah. Hi. Just... a cough. Been coughin’ a bit. And there’s… stuff. Red stuff. When I cough. I smoke, you know. A lot. That’s probably it. I don’t… really remember when it started, exactly. Just been happenin’.
DOCTOR: “A bit,” you say. And “red stuff.” Right. We’ll get to the bottom of it, though I suspect it’s as you say. Still, we have a standard protocol. How would you characterize this cough?
PATIENT: Uh… how to… character-ize? It’s… wet, I guess. And it happens mostly in the mornin’. Feels like somethin’ stuck in my chest, too. Not all the time, though. Like I said, I smoke. A pack a day, maybe more. For… a long time. Does that matter? I forget things easy these days.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Reyno, that does matter. A pack a day for… how long precisely?
PATIENT: Shoot. Uh… a long time. Since I was… young. Maybe… thirty years? Longer? I don't keep track. It's been a long time. Look, I just want to know if it's somethin' bad. Is it somethin' I gotta worry 'bout? I got things to do, you know? Gotta get back to work… dispatchin’. Power ain't gonna move itself.
DOCTOR: Thirty years. Right. Dispatching… a physically demanding job, I presume?
PATIENT: Not… really. Mostly sittin'. Talkin' on the radio. Tellin' folks where to go, keepin' the lights on. It’s stress, mostly. Keeps ya on your feet, mentally. But, no. Not liftin' nothin'. Just… thinkin’ fast. Is that important? I’m sorry, I… I don't mean to be difficult. Just… forgetful, like I said. And this cough is worryin' me.
DOCTOR: It is relevant, Mr. Reyno. Now, have you experienced any fever, chills, night sweats, or unintentional weight loss accompanying this cough?
PATIENT: Uh… fever? Not that I know of. Maybe a little warm sometimes, but… I always figured that was the heat. We’ve had a hot summer. Chills… no, not really. Weight loss… maybe? I ain't been eatin' as much lately. Been too busy… and stressed. Hard to explain. I just… feel tired a lot, if that counts. Does any of this mean it's bad?
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you experiencing any shortness of breath, or pain in your chest when you cough or breathe deeply?
PATIENT: Shortness of breath… not… always. Sometimes when I walk up hills. I live kinda high up, near the mesa. Could just be the air. Pain… yeah, sometimes. Right here. It’s… a dull ache. Comes and goes. Not sharp, nothin' terrible. I figured it was… just old age, maybe. Or the stress. Lots of stress.
DOCTOR: I see. Now, I'm going to need to listen to your lungs and check your oxygen levels. It will be quick. Please sit back and take a few deep breaths when I ask.
PATIENT: Alright. Sounds… good. Deep breaths. I can do that. Just… try to make it quick, if you could. I got a schedule to keep. Dispatch ain't gonna run itself, you know. I'm dependin' on ya.
DOCTOR: Take a deep breath… and exhale. Again… Good. Your oxygen saturation is 92%, which is… acceptable, though on the lower end of normal. I’m detecting some diminished breath sounds in both lower lobes, and some mild wheezing. I also note a slight increase in your respiratory rate.
PATIENT: Uh… diminished? Wheezin’? What does that mean? Is that… bad? I don’t understand all this fancy talk. Just tell me straight. Am I dyin'? I need to know if I gotta call someone… or get my affairs in order. I got folks dependin’ on me. Just… be honest. I ain't one for beatin’ around the bush.
DOCTOR: Mr. Reyno, please. You are not dying. However, your symptoms and the findings on examination are concerning. Given your smoking history and the presentation, we need to rule out several possibilities, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease – COPD – bronchitis, and pneumonia. It could also be a manifestation of something else entirely. I am ordering a chest X-ray and a pulmonary function test. These tests will help us determine the cause of your cough and assess the health of your lungs. We will also need to collect a sputum sample to check for infection.
PATIENT: Tests… more tests. Shoot. Sputum sample? That sounds… messy. Look, Doc, is it the smokin’? Is it somethin’ I did? I knew I shoulda quit years ago. My grandma always told me… But now? Is it too late? And… how long is all this gonna take? I got shifts to cover. People need power. Is there anything I can do in the meantime? Like… some medicine, or somethin’? I don’t wanna fall behind.
DOCTOR: The sputum sample is necessary for accurate diagnosis, Mr. Reyno. As for your question, smoking is, undoubtedly, a significant contributing factor. Whether it's "too late" is not something I can answer definitively until we have the results of the tests. In the meantime, I will prescribe a bronchodilator to help open your airways and alleviate some of the wheezing. It's a temporary measure, though. It will not address the underlying cause. I strongly advise you to consider smoking cessation. I will also have the nurse schedule you for the X-ray and pulmonary function test as soon as possible. Do not delay. It is imperative that we gather this information promptly. Now, is there anything else?
PATIENT: Uh… no. I think that's it. Just… the tests, and the medicine. And… quit smokin’. I figured as much. It’s… hard. Really hard. Alright. Well, I guess I better get goin’. Gotta get back to work. People depend on me, remember? Thanks, Doc. I… appreciate you not sugarcoatin’ it. Even if it ain’t good news. I'll… schedule the tests. And… try to quit. .
