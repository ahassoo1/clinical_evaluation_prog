DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Drahota. My name is Dr. Soodeen. It's nice to meet you. Can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Yes, well, I suppose. It’s this… discoloration. And the exhaustion, of course. Simply dreadful. Honestly, I haven’t the time for these things, you understand. A man has work to do. Rebar doesn’t reinforce itself. Now, what was the question?
DOCTOR: Yes, of course. You mentioned discoloration and exhaustion. Can you tell me more about the discoloration, Mr. Drahota?
PATIENT: It’s… darker. My skin. It wasn’t always like this. A sort of… muddy tone, I’d say. And it seems to get worse when I've been out in the sun. Though, frankly, I’ve been working so hard lately, it’s difficult to recall exactly when it started. It’s just… there. And bothersome. Are we nearly done? I have a shipment arriving this afternoon.
DOCTOR: I understand your time is valuable, Mr. Drahota. We'll try to be as efficient as possible. You mentioned the discoloration worsens with sun exposure. Is it located all over your body, or just in certain areas?
PATIENT: Hmm. All over, I believe. Though perhaps more… prominent on my arms and face. Yes, definitely the face. It's rather unflattering, you understand. I used to have a… a much more even complexion. Goodness, this is tedious. Is this truly necessary? I’ve always been a robust man. A little color change isn’t going to kill me.
DOCTOR: I understand. And has this discoloration been accompanied by any other changes?
PATIENT: Changes? What sort of changes are you referring to? My wife keeps complaining about my temper, but that's been the case for sixty years, hasn't it? No, I can't say I've noticed anything else… aside from the fatigue, of course. A constant, draining… weariness. It’s affecting my work, which is unacceptable. Now, are we getting anywhere? This is a rather unproductive discussion, wouldn't you agree?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Drahota. The fatigue and the discoloration are concerning, especially given their recent onset. Have you experienced any itching, pain, or blistering associated with the discoloration?
PATIENT: Itching? Blistering? Good heavens, no. I’m not some sort of… rash-afflicted youth. No, simply… tired. And a bit… darkened. Honestly, I fail to see what the fuss is about. A little sun, a little hard work… it’s a natural process, surely. Are you a specialist in… robust constitutions, Doctor? Perhaps I should have gone to someone else. This is all very… unnecessary. .
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Drahota. While it may seem minor to you, these changes warrant investigation. To get a clearer picture, I would like to perform a brief physical exam, if you’re amenable. It will involve looking at your skin more closely and checking your vital signs. Would that be acceptable?
