DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Steines. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Voytek. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just Venna is fine. Well, my blood pressure’s been actin’ up. Been high, the nurse said when she took it back there. That’s why I’m here, I reckon. Don’t really know much about it, just know it ain't good.
DOCTOR: Okay, Venna. Thank you. And it’s good you came in to get it checked out. “Actin’ up” is a good way to put it – high blood pressure can cause problems if it’s not managed. Let me pull up your chart here… Alright, I see the nurse did get a reading. Can you tell me a little more about when you’ve been noticing this?
PATIENT: Hmm… when? That’s a good question. Seems like it’s been worse lately, with all this heat we’ve been havin’. I get kinda lightheaded when I’m bakin’, standin’ over the oven. But I don't rightly know when it started, exactly. Maybe a few weeks ago? It's hard to keep track at my age, you know.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Venna. A few weeks is helpful. And the heat makes sense—it can definitely affect things. The lightheadedness when baking is good to know, too. Do you typically measure your blood pressure at home, or is this mostly readings from the nurse or doctor’s office?
PATIENT: No, honey, I don't. Never have. Always just checked it when I come to the doctor. Don’t own one of them machines. Seemed like somethin’ only folks with real trouble needed, and I always felt okay, mostly. 'Til lately, that is.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good information. So, mostly we’re going off the readings here at the clinic and how you’ve been feeling. Besides the lightheadedness, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Let me think… not really. I get tired easier, maybe. But I'm ninety years old! Gettin' tired is kinda normal, isn’t it? I used to be able to bake all day, now I gotta sit down a spell every couple hours. But I figured that was just… old age. No headaches or nothin’ like that. Just tired and a little wobbly sometimes.
DOCTOR: That’s very fair, Venna. Tiredness is common, but it's good to explore everything, just to be sure. And you're right to tell me about the wobbliness. Now, have you been taking any medications regularly, or do you have any allergies to any medicines?
PATIENT: Just the little blue pill for my arthritis. Can’t remember the name of it, but it helps with my hands. And no, I don't have no allergies. Never had a reaction to nothin’, thankfully. I’m pretty lucky that way, I suppose. Oh! And I take a vitamin D supplement in the winter, 'cause the nurse told me to. But that’s it, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. Arthritis medication and a vitamin D supplement. And are there any major illnesses in your family – things like heart disease, high blood pressure, diabetes, stroke – that run in the family?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a tough one. My mama, she had a weak heart, I think. But she didn’t go to the doctor much. Lived out in the country, didn’t have easy access like we do now. And my brother, he had some kinda sugar sickness, but I don’t know the name of it. He passed away a long time ago. Everyone in my family was pretty tough, didn’t complain much about illness. So I don’t rightly know what all ran in the family, honey.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Venna. It’s common for family medical history to be a little unclear, especially when folks didn’t see doctors as often. Weak heart and “sugar sickness” are helpful to know. Alright. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. Just listen to your heart and lungs, check your pulse, and take a look at your hands and feet. It won’t take long. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yes, honey, that’s fine. Go right ahead. I don’t mind. I'm used to doctors pokin' and proddin'. Just try not to poke too hard, alright?
DOCTOR: Of course not, Venna. I'll be gentle. Alright. Your heart sounds a little… rapid, and I can hear a slight murmur. Your lungs sound clear, though. Your pulse is definitely a bit fast, and I notice some mild swelling in your ankles. Your hands show some signs of arthritis, as you mentioned. Blood pressure is 160/95. Okay. Based on what you’ve told me, your history, and what I’m hearing and seeing, it sounds like you are likely dealing with high blood pressure, or hypertension. The swelling in your ankles could be related to that. It's good we’re catching this now.
PATIENT: Hypertension, huh? That sounds… serious. Is it somethin’ I got to worry about? What do I do about it? Is it from all the heat, or somethin’ I’m eatin’? I just want to keep bakin’, honey. I don’t want to have to stop.
DOCTOR: It is serious, Venna, but it’s very manageable, and we’re going to work on it together. It doesn't mean you have to stop baking, but we will need to make some changes. The heat can contribute to it, and diet plays a big role, but often there’s a genetic component as well. It's not usually just one thing. The good news is, we can often control it with medication and lifestyle changes. I want to order some blood work and a urine test just to get a better overall picture of your health and make sure there aren’t any other underlying issues. And I'm going to recommend starting a low-sodium diet and getting some regular, gentle exercise, like walking. Then, depending on the results of the blood work, we may need to start you on a medication to help lower your blood pressure. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Low-sodium diet… that means less salt, right? I use salt in my bakin’, of course. And walkin’… well, I ain't walked much lately, but I can try. Blood work… I don’t love needles, but if it's gonna help, I guess I can do it. And medication… I always try to avoid them if I can. But if you think it's necessary… alright. Just tell me what I need to do, honey. I'm an old woman, and I'm tired, but I still want to live a little while longer… and keep bakin’, if I can.
DOCTOR: That’s exactly the right attitude, Venna. And I understand your concerns about medication – we’ll start with the lowest possible dose, and we’ll monitor you closely. Okay, I'm going to give you a lab order for the blood work and urine test. You can go to the lab down the hall, and they’ll take care of everything. The results should be back in a few days. Here’s a handout on low-sodium diets. It has a list of foods to avoid and some healthy substitutions. And I'll have the nurse give you a list of local walking groups – that way you don’t have to do it alone. I want you to schedule a follow-up appointment with me in two weeks so we can discuss the lab results and see how you’re doing with the diet and exercise. Does that work for you?
PATIENT: Two weeks sounds fine, honey. I can write that down. I reckon I can cut back on the salt. And I'll look into them walkin' groups. It's good to know I don't have to do it alone. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very kind. I appreciate you takin’ the time to explain everything. I think that’s all I need for now. Can I go now? I got a pie crust to make, you know.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Venna. That’s what I’m here for. And a pie crust is a very good reason to get going! Yes, you can absolutely go now. The nurse will escort you to the lab. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before your next appointment. And enjoy your baking!
