DOCTOR: Good morning, Mrs. Genard. I am Dr. Gonzalezperez. It says here you’re 73 years of age. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Seventy-three, huh? Seems like yesterday I was a young girl. Anyway... it's... well, it's a problem down there. A little leak, you could say. It's been... happening. I don't know why it's happening, and frankly, I don't want to talk about it much. It's embarrassing!
DOCTOR: I understand your discomfort, Mrs. Genard. These things can be… delicate subjects. A “leak,” as you put it… is this leakage of urine, then?
PATIENT: Urine? Oh, no, no, no. Not that. It's... something else. A little... discharge. Like... sticky. And smelly. Not urine. Definitely not urine. Why are you asking so many questions? It's just... down there. You're a doctor, you should know!
DOCTOR: I am trying to ascertain the nature of the problem, Mrs. Genard. “Down there” is a rather broad anatomical area. To properly assist you, I require specifics. Is it constant, or intermittent?
PATIENT: Inter... what now? Look, it comes and goes. Sometimes it's there, sometimes it's not. It's not like a faucet you can turn on and off! And it's been... longer than I can remember, to be honest. A few weeks, maybe? A month? Old lady problems, I guess. Why does it matter how long? Just fix it!
DOCTOR: A few weeks to a month is… helpful, though imprecise. And "old lady problems," as you put it, can have a variety of causes, some more serious than others. To rule out anything concerning, I need to ask a few more questions. Have you noticed any pain, burning, or itching associated with this discharge?
PATIENT: Pain? No, not really pain. It’s more… uncomfortable. Like something’s just… not right. And itchy sometimes, yeah, a little. But mostly just… sticky. And smelly. Really smelly. Like… old fish, almost. It's disgusting. I've been trying to keep it clean, but it doesn't seem to help much. Are you gonna poke at it? I really don’t want you poking at it.
DOCTOR: I understand your apprehension regarding an examination, Mrs. Genard. A physical exam is necessary, however, to properly evaluate the source of the discharge. It’s the only way to determine the cause accurately. Before we proceed with that, let me ask about your medical history. Do you have any known allergies?
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmm... Let me think. I don't think so. Maybe to some shellfish once, a long time ago. But I haven't eaten shellfish in years! Mostly I just... stay away from stuff that doesn't agree with me. I get a little heartburn sometimes, but that’s it. Never been sick much, except for the flu now and then. Why does knowing about the flu matter? This is about down there, not my stomach!
DOCTOR: The complete medical picture is important, Mrs. Genard. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Hospitalized? Oh, goodness. Let me think… When I was a girl, I had my tonsils out. A long, long time ago. And when I broke my wrist, but that wasn’t a hospital stay, just the doctor wrapped it up. Other than that… no. Never been much for doctors, honestly. They always poke and prod. And ask a million questions. Like you are. Are we getting anywhere with this down there problem yet? It’s very embarrassing, you know.
DOCTOR: We are making progress, Mrs. Genard. I assure you. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter remedies or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications? Just a little something for my arthritis in my hands. Makes them less achy. And sometimes I take something for my heartburn, but not every day. It's... pink. A little pink pill. And I take a vitamin, sometimes. Just a regular multivitamin. Why are you asking me about pills? Does this have something to do with the down there thing? You're making my head spin with all these questions.
DOCTOR: Certain medications can contribute to vaginal changes, that is why I ask. Now, concerning your family… has anyone in your family had similar issues?
PATIENT: Similar issues? What do you mean, similar? My mother... well, she didn't talk much about those things. Old-fashioned woman. My sister, she had... something. When she was older. I don’t remember what. She went to the doctor, but she never told me the details. Women don’t talk about these things! It’s embarrassing! Honestly, Doctor, I'm not sure why I even came here. You just keep asking questions and poking around. It’s awful!
DOCTOR: I understand your discomfort, Mrs. Genard, and I apologize if I’m making you feel uncomfortable. But to properly assess your condition, I do need to gather as much information as possible. Now, regarding your social history… are you sexually active?
PATIENT: What?! Oh, my goodness! Doctor, that is a very personal question! I'm seventy-three years old! Do you really think…? Honestly, I don't appreciate you asking me something like that. It's rude! I came here because of this… this problem, not to discuss my personal life. That's none of your business! .
DOCTOR: I apologize, Mrs. Genard. I understand your reaction. It was not my intention to offend you. The question is a standard part of the assessment to rule out potential causes of infection. However, I will respect your privacy. Given your discomfort, and the limited information I’ve been able to gather, I believe a physical examination is even more crucial. I will proceed with the utmost sensitivity and respect. If at any point you feel uncomfortable, please let me know, and we will stop immediately. Would that be acceptable?
