DOCTOR: Good morning, Sherrell. I’m Dr. Fazzina. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. It is… very nice to meet you as well. Well, it’s… difficult to explain, really. I have trouble… finding the right words sometimes. It’s been happening for… a little while now, I think. It’s not constant, but… frustrating.
DOCTOR: Okay, frustrating is a good way to put it. No problem at all, we’ll take our time. “A little while now…” can you tell me approximately how long?
PATIENT: Hmm. That is… a good question. It feels like… maybe six months? Or perhaps longer? It is difficult to say exactly. My memory… is not what it once was. I remember my wife… very clearly, of course, but… other things… they slip away.
DOCTOR: Six months is helpful. It's alright if you're not precise, we’ll work with what you do remember. So, this difficulty with finding the right words… can you describe how it happens?
PATIENT: Well… sometimes the word is right there, on the tip of my tongue, you understand? I know what I want to say, but… it won’t come out. Or… I’ll use the wrong word entirely, and it feels… wrong. Like… when I am talking about… the garden, perhaps. I might say… “flower” when I mean… the bush. Something like that. It is… very peculiar.
DOCTOR: Okay, so words feel accessible, but not quite retrievable, and sometimes you substitute the wrong word. Does this happen more often when you’re stressed or tired, or does it seem random?
PATIENT: That is… a good question. I do not think it is the stress, exactly. I am… not a stressed man. My wife… passing… that was stressful. But this… this is different. Perhaps when I am… tired? Yes. When I have not had enough sleep, it is… worse. But it also happens… just like that. When I am perfectly calm, and well-rested.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it's not exclusively tied to stress or fatigue, which is good to know. It sounds like it happens somewhat intermittently. Besides the difficulty with finding words, are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… Hmm. My balance… is not as good as it once was. I sometimes… stumble a little. Nothing serious, mind you. Just… a little unsteady on my feet. And… I seem to… lose things more often. My glasses, for example. Though, perhaps that is just… being an old man.
DOCTOR: Okay, balance issues and misplacing things. Those are good things to mention. And it's always good to be thorough, so don't dismiss anything, even if it seems minor. Have you noticed any changes in your vision, hearing, or sense of taste or smell?
PATIENT: Vision… I wear glasses, as you can see. And I do need to have them adjusted from time to time. But no… no changes in my vision, not really. Hearing… perhaps a little quieter? My wife used to say I didn't listen to her enough. But no, nothing… dramatic. And my sense of taste… and smell… they seem… fine. I enjoy my coffee in the morning.
DOCTOR: Good. That's helpful. And you mentioned your wife passing… I’m very sorry for your loss. Grief can sometimes manifest in unexpected ways. Now, just to get a more complete picture, can you tell me about any past medical conditions you've been diagnosed with, or any surgeries you've had?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. It was… some time ago now. But yes. I had… a heart condition, many years ago. They… put a stent in. And… I had my appendix removed when I was a young man. A very simple operation, really. Nothing else… comes to mind. I see my doctor regularly for check-ups, of course. Medicare… keeps me in line.
DOCTOR: Okay, a stent placement for a heart condition and an appendectomy. Good to know. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… Hmm. I do not think so. I have never had a… reaction to anything. No hives, no swelling… nothing like that. My wife… she was allergic to… cats, I believe. But I… I am fine. No allergies that I know of.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s good. And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications… let me see. I take a small pill for my… blood pressure. Just a small one, every morning. And… sometimes, if my knees are bothering me, I take something for the pain. Ibuprofen, I think it is called. Nothing else, Doctor. I try to avoid taking too many pills.
DOCTOR: Okay, a medication for blood pressure and ibuprofen as needed for knee pain. That’s good to know. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright. Just checking your reflexes, balance, and a few other things. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. Please, proceed. I am… quite willing to cooperate.
DOCTOR: <stage>I nod and gently help him sit forward on the examination table. I begin by checking his blood pressure and pulse. "Your blood pressure is a little elevated today, 145 over 88. Your pulse is 72, regular." I listen to his heart and lungs with my stethoscope. "Heart sounds are normal, no murmurs. Lungs are clear." I then test his reflexes in his arms and legs. "Reflexes are a little diminished, but within normal limits for your age." Finally, I ask him to stand and walk a few steps, observing his gait and balance. "Your gait is slightly unsteady, and there's a mild tremor when you walk. Could you follow my finger with your eyes without moving your head?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. And… yes, I am looking at your finger. It is… a little difficult, to be honest. My eyes… they do not move as quickly as they once did. But I am trying my best.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you. That was helpful. Now, one last thing. I’m going to gently check your cranial nerves. This involves a few simple tests of your facial movements and sensation. Just follow my instructions as best you can. I'm going to ask you to smile, furrow your brow, and close your eyes tightly. Just let me know if anything feels uncomfortable.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. I will try my best. Please, proceed. I… trust you. Is that… correct? It feels… strange, to be focusing on my face like this.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you. Everything seems mostly intact, although there's a subtle asymmetry in your facial expression. That's not necessarily a cause for concern on its own, but it's something we need to consider. Alright, Sherrell. Based on what you've told me and the results of the physical exam, it sounds like you're experiencing some cognitive changes – specifically, difficulty with word retrieval – along with some mild balance issues and a subtle tremor. These symptoms could be due to a number of things, including normal age-related changes, medication side effects, or something more serious. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to order a few tests. These include a complete blood count, a thyroid panel, and an MRI of the brain to rule out any structural abnormalities. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: An MRI… that sounds… serious, Doctor. But… if that is what is needed to find out what is happening… then yes, of course. I trust your judgment. Blood tests… I can handle those. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just… I want to know what is happening. And… if there is something that can be done.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly understandable, Sherrell. An MRI will give us a lot of information, and it's a relatively safe procedure. We'll take all necessary precautions. I’ll write up the orders for the lab tests and the MRI. The lab can draw blood today, and we can schedule the MRI for next week. In the meantime, I'd like to temporarily discontinue the ibuprofen, as it could potentially be contributing to some of your symptoms. Also, I’m going to recommend a referral to a neurologist – a specialist in brain and nerve disorders – for further evaluation. They’ll be able to interpret the MRI results and help us determine the best course of action. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… reasonable. No ibuprofen… I can manage that. A neurologist… yes, of course. Whatever you think is best. It is… frightening, to hear all of this. But… I appreciate you taking the time to listen, and… trying to figure out what is happening. Thank you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Sherrell. It's perfectly natural to feel frightened, but we'll take things one step at a time. I’m going to write down the neurologist's contact information and the details about the MRI. I'll also send these orders to your primary care physician so they're aware of what's going on. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No… I don’t think so, Doctor. You have explained everything very clearly. Perhaps… how long will it take to get the results of the MRI? And… what if… what if it is something serious?
DOCTOR: That’s a very valid question, Sherrell. The results of the MRI usually take about 24 to 48 hours to come back. Once we have them, I’ll review them carefully and schedule a follow-up appointment with you to discuss the findings. As for what if it is something serious… we’ll cross that bridge when we come to it. There are many possible causes for your symptoms, and not all of them are serious. If it turns out to be something that requires treatment, we’ll develop a plan together. There are many effective treatments available, and we’ll do everything we can to manage your condition and improve your quality of life. I know it's a lot to take in, but please remember that we're in this together. I'm here to support you every step of the way. Do you have any questions about scheduling the tests, or anything else I can help you with right now?
PATIENT: No… I think that is all, Doctor. Thank you. Truly. You have been… very kind. I appreciate your patience and… your honesty. I will… schedule the tests as soon as possible. I believe that is everything. Thank you again, Doctor Fazzina.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Sherrell. Please don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your appointments. And remember, we’ll take things one step at a time. It was a pleasure meeting you. Take care, and I look forward to seeing you soon.
