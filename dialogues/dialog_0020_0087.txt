DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Croonquist. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Beinborn. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, uh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Beinborn, right? Yes. Well, it’s just… the lab work. The usual, I suppose. My memory isn’t what it used to be, so I can’t really say what usual is. Just… what I need to get done. If that makes sense. Let’s just get it over with, shall we? I have… things to do.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes sense. We do have your records here, and it looks like you come in regularly for some standard blood work. I see you've had some tests done previously to check your cholesterol, kidney function, and blood sugar. Is that still the plan today, or has something changed?
PATIENT: Oh. Right. Cholesterol… kidneys… sugar. Sounds about right. Honestly, Doctor, I wouldn’t know if it’s changed. I just… they tell me to come in, I come in. I trust them. Just… the same as always, I guess. If that's not too much trouble. The quicker we do it, the better. I’m not a fan of waiting around.
DOCTOR: No trouble at all, Mr. Croonquist. We can certainly do the standard panel. Just to confirm, that includes a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel—which checks your kidney function, electrolytes, and blood sugar—and a lipid panel to check your cholesterol. Is there anything else you’ve noticed lately that’s concerning you?
PATIENT: Complete… meta… lipid… Look, Doctor, with all due respect, those are just words to me. I feel… okay. A little tired, maybe. But I’m 73! Of course I’m tired. I don't really notice things, if you understand. Just get the tests done, tell me if anything’s terribly wrong, and I’ll… well, I’ll deal with it. Is that possible? Just the routine stuff, please.
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely. We can definitely proceed with the routine blood work. It sounds like you're generally feeling alright, which is good. Before we get started, let me just quickly review your medications and allergies to make sure everything is up-to-date. Do you take any medications regularly, and do you have any known allergies to any medications or anything else, like food or latex?
PATIENT: Medications… Hmm. Let me think. I think I used to take something for my… blood pressure, maybe? A little white pill. But I stopped taking it a while ago. The doctor told me it was okay. As for allergies… not that I know of. I eat everything. I haven't had any trouble with anything… recently. Honestly, Doctor, my memory is just a mess. I'm sorry I can’t be more helpful. Let's just skip that part, if that’s alright? It's probably all in the records anyway.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Croonquist. We can rely on the records for now, but it’s always good to double-check. Okay. Let’s go ahead and get these blood tests done. We’ll need to draw a few vials of blood. Do you have any issues with needles, or have you fainted during blood draws before?
PATIENT: Needles… Oh, dear. I don't like them, if that’s any consolation. Never fainted, thankfully. Just… a little anxious, maybe? I try not to look. Just get it over with quickly, please. And be gentle, if you wouldn't mind. It's… not my favorite thing. Can we just… do it? The sooner it’s done, the better.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Croonquist. We'll be as quick and gentle as possible. Our phlebotomist is very experienced. I’ll let her know you’re a bit anxious, and she'll take extra care. Please have a seat here, and I’ll have her come in right away. Just relax your arm, and try to take a few deep breaths. We'll have you all set in no time. “Could you come in here and draw some labs for Mr. Croonquist?
PATIENT: Finally. Thank you, Doctor. Just… get it over with. I'm not a fan of this whole process, you understand. The quicker, the better. Really.
DOCTOR: “Mr. Croonquist is a bit anxious about needles, so please be as gentle as possible.” Alright, Mr. Croonquist, the phlebotomist is just getting prepared. You can look away if you prefer. Just try to relax your arm. She’ll clean the area first, then you’ll feel a quick pinch. It shouldn't take long. Let me know if you feel any discomfort.
PATIENT: Just… hurry. Please. I don't like this. Not one bit. Just… get it done. I'm trying to relax, but it's… difficult. Hurry, hurry…
DOCTOR: Almost done, Mr. Croonquist. Just a few more seconds. You’re doing great. Alright, all done. How are you feeling?
PATIENT: Finally. Over. Thank goodness. A little lightheaded, maybe. But… over. Yes, over. Just… need a moment. Don't like needles. Never have. Never will. Can I go now? I'd like to sit down somewhere quiet. Is that alright? Just… need a minute.
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely, Mr. Croonquist. Let’s have you sit down in the waiting area for a few minutes. I’ll have the nurse bring you a glass of water. Just take a few deep breaths and relax. It's common to feel a little lightheaded after a blood draw. We'll monitor you for a few minutes to make sure everything is okay. “Could you please bring a glass of water to Mr. Croonquist in the waiting area and just check on him in about five minutes?
PATIENT: Yes. Water would be good. Thank you. Just… quiet. I need quiet. And water. That’s all. I’m not a fan of… any of this, you understand. Just want to go home now. Is there anything else I need to do? Or can I just… go?
DOCTOR: Let's sit down for just a few minutes first, Mr. Croonquist. We want to make sure you’re feeling stable before you leave. The nurse will be right with you to bring water and check your blood pressure. It's just a precaution. Once we confirm you're feeling okay, we can discuss the next steps. The lab results will take a few days to come back, and then we can schedule a follow-up appointment to review them. How does that sound?
PATIENT: A follow-up? More appointments? Look, Doctor, with all due respect, I just want to get this over with. I trust you, I suppose. But I really don't want to come back again if I can avoid it. Can't you just… tell me if something's terribly wrong over the phone? I'm 73 years old. I don't need a lot of… fuss. Just tell me the bad news, if there is any, and I'll deal with it. Please.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Croonquist. We can certainly discuss that. While I prefer to review lab results in person to fully explain everything and answer any questions you might have, I can certainly call you with any critical findings. However, it's important to remember that these tests provide a snapshot of your health, and a follow-up appointment allows us to track any changes over time. How about this: I’ll call you with any concerning results. If everything looks normal, I'll leave a message summarizing the findings. But if anything requires further discussion, we can schedule a brief follow-up appointment. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Acceptable. Yes, that's… acceptable. Just call me with the bad news, and I'll deal with it. No fuss. No appointments if everything's alright. That sounds… reasonable. I just want to get home now. Is there anything else I need to do before I leave? Paperwork? Forms? I'm really not good with… details.
DOCTOR: No, nothing else at all, Mr. Croonquist. The nurse has already taken care of everything. Just take your time getting up, and remember to drink plenty of water. We’ll call you as soon as the results are available. It was nice meeting you, Mr. Croonquist. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. And please, try to get some rest. Have a good day.
PATIENT: Good… good day to you too, Doctor. Thank you. Just… no fuss. I just want to go home now.
