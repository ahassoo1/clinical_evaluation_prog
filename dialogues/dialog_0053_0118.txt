DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Oriley. I’m Dr. Pitmon. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. Pitmon, you say? Yes, well... it’s about this certification, I believe. Something to do with… keeping my license current. It’s all rather foggy, to be honest. One gets to a certain age, you see, and these details… they simply slip away. I think it’s an eye exam, but it could be the ears. Honestly, the paperwork was… extensive.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, we all have those days. It is a recertification exam, yes. And it does cover both vision and hearing. Standard procedure, really. It’s important to ensure you’re still fit to… perform your duties, whatever those may be. Let’s start with your vision. Have you noticed any changes recently?
PATIENT: Changes? Hmm. Well, I suppose things aren't quite as sharp as they once were. But that's to be expected, isn’t it? I still manage perfectly well, thank you. I wouldn't be here if I couldn't. It’s more the principle of the thing, really. One shouldn’t have to jump through so many hoops. Is this going to take long? I have… commitments, you understand.
DOCTOR: “Perfectly well” is… subjective, Mr. Oriley. And the purpose of this exam is to objectively assess your capabilities. We need to rule out anything that could potentially compromise your safety, or the safety of others. It shouldn’t take too long, but rushing through it wouldn’t be beneficial. Now, let’s start with a basic visual acuity test. Could you please read the smallest line on this chart for me?
PATIENT: Oh, very well. But I must say, the lighting in here is rather poor. It makes it difficult to… focus. And these letters... are they all the same size? It seems terribly inefficient. Let me see… is that an ‘F’? No… a ‘P’? Goodness, this is frustrating. I suppose it’s… ‘E’… ‘F’… ‘P’… quite difficult, really. Is this necessary?
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Oriley, it is. It's a standardized test. Your vision is 20/40 in your right eye and 20/30 in your left. That indicates some degree of visual impairment. Now, let's check your peripheral vision. I'm going to ask you to look straight ahead and tell me when you see something in your side vision. Are you familiar with this procedure?
PATIENT: Peripheral vision, you say? Vaguely. I’ve had… tests before, I presume. Though I can’t say I recall the specifics. Honestly, Doctor, I’m a perfectly capable individual. I haven’t… misjudged a distance in years. But if you insist. Proceed, then. Just try to be quick about it. I find staring into the void rather unsettling.
DOCTOR: Please tell me when you see a light flash in either your left or right peripheral vision. Don't blink, and try to remain as still as possible. And please focus on the center point. Your peripheral vision is… limited. We're detecting some significant deficits on both sides. It's not ideal, Mr. Oriley. Have you experienced any changes in your field of vision recently?
PATIENT: Limited? I assure you, Doctor, I haven’t missed a thing. Perhaps your equipment is faulty. These modern devices… they’re never reliable. As for changes… no, not that I’ve noticed. Though I do sometimes find myself… adjusting my head to get a better view. A perfectly normal occurrence for a man of my age, wouldn't you say? Is there something wrong? Are you suggesting I’m… unfit? Because I can assure you…
DOCTOR: Mr. Oriley, let’s not get ahead of ourselves. I’m simply documenting the findings. These results are concerning, and they necessitate further investigation. We need to rule out any underlying conditions that could be affecting your vision and peripheral vision. Now, let’s move on to the hearing test. Have you noticed any difficulty hearing conversations, or have you been turning up the volume on the television or radio?
PATIENT: Further investigation? Honestly, Doctor, this is becoming rather… tedious. I came here for a certification, not a medical examination. I assure you, my hearing is perfectly adequate. I can hear perfectly well. People tend to mumble these days, that’s the problem. And the television… well, one likes to listen to a bit of music while relaxing. It’s hardly a sign of deafness. Are you going to poke things in my ears now? I really dislike that.
DOCTOR: Mr. Oriley, with all due respect, your subjective assessment isn’t sufficient. We need to conduct a formal audiometry test to determine the extent of any hearing loss. It’s a quick, painless procedure. And frankly, given the results of the vision test, it’s prudent to rule out any underlying issues. I’m concerned about your ability to safely perform your duties. Now, are you willing to cooperate with the hearing test, or should we discuss a referral to a specialist for a comprehensive neurological evaluation?
PATIENT: A neurological evaluation? Good heavens, Doctor, you’re being quite dramatic. Very well. Conduct your… test. But I warn you, it will likely yield perfectly normal results. I simply do not appreciate being subjected to this… scrutiny. And please, be gentle. I have sensitive ears. Get on with it, then. The sooner this is over, the better. But I expect a full explanation of the results, and a prompt resolution to this… inconvenience.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Oriley. I’m going to play a series of tones at different frequencies and volumes in each ear. Please raise your hand when you hear a tone, no matter how faint. Focus on listening carefully, and try to remain as still as possible. We’ll start with your right ear. The results are… concerning. You have moderate to severe hearing loss in both ears, particularly in the higher frequencies. This explains the difficulty you likely have with conversations and understanding speech. Mr. Oriley, I strongly recommend a referral to an audiologist for a comprehensive hearing evaluation and consideration of hearing aids. Given these findings, and the deficits in your vision, I also recommend a neurological consultation to rule out any underlying causes. Continuing to operate with these impairments could pose a significant risk to yourself and others. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Moderate to severe hearing loss? That’s… preposterous. I’ve never had any trouble hearing. People just mumble, I tell you. And a neurological consultation? This is outrageous! Are you attempting to invalidate my entire career? I’ve been doing this for decades, perfectly capably, thank you very much. I will not be subjected to this… alarmist scaremongering. I think I’ve heard enough. I’m leaving now. And I expect a full refund for this… wasted time. Do you understand that? I’ll be contacting the certifying board about this… unfortunate experience. .
