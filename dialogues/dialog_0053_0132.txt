DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Coby. I'm Dr. Pitmon. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. It’s this heat, you see. Just awful. I can't seem to handle it like I used to. Gets right under my skin, makes me feel…well, just plain uncomfortable. Never used to bother me this much.
DOCTOR: Right. The heat is rather oppressive. And it can certainly exacerbate things. Uncomfortable how, exactly?
PATIENT: Exacerbate? What does that even mean? Look, I just sweat. A lot. And I get…flustered. Like my blood's turned to soup. It's not a pleasant feeling, I can tell you that much. Makes concentrating on work impossible. And I need to concentrate. I’m a painter, mostly. And I do some construction when I can. Can’t be messing about with scaffolding when you're feeling faint.
DOCTOR: "Exacerbate" means it makes things worse, Mr. Coby. I apologize for the medical terminology – bad habit. So, excessive sweating and feeling…flustered, as you put it. And this is new, or has it been gradual?
PATIENT: Oh, it's definitely new. It started…well, I'd say maybe the spring? But it's gotten steadily worse with each heatwave. This last week has been particularly bad. I used to work all day in the sun, no problem. Now? I'm lucky if I last a couple of hours. And it's not just physical, you know. My head feels…foggy. Like I’m losing my edge. It’s frustrating, really. I've always prided myself on being sharp.
DOCTOR: Okay, so spring onset, worsening with the heat. And you're noticing a cognitive element – the "foggy" head. Hmm. Are you experiencing anything else alongside the sweating and fluster?
PATIENT: Anything else? Let me think… Well, I’ve been a bit… thirsty, I suppose. More than usual. And…my appetite hasn't been what it used to be. Not that I need a huge appetite, mind you. I’m not a big eater. But even less than usual. And I’ve been… a little irritable, I guess. My nephew keeps offering me those fancy sports drinks, says they’re “electrolytes” or something. Rubbish, I tell you. Just sugary water. I’ve always found a good cup of tea does the trick. But, yes. Thirsty, less hungry, and a bit on edge. Does that help?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's helpful. Increased thirst, decreased appetite, irritability… alright. Now, have you noticed any changes in how much you’re urinating?
PATIENT: Urinating? Really, Doctor? Are we going to discuss everything now? Look, I go to the toilet when I need to. It hasn't particularly changed, no. Maybe a bit more often, now I think about it, with all the sweating. But nothing… drastic. Honestly, I’m starting to feel like I’m being pulled apart here. One minute it’s my head, the next it’s my waterworks. Is this heatwave doing something to my brain?
DOCTOR: Mr. Coby, I assure you, I’m trying to get a complete picture. These things do tend to be connected. Increased urination with increased thirst can be significant. Now, let's move on. Any dizziness or lightheadedness?
PATIENT: Alright, alright. Connected, you say? Well, the dizziness… yes, now that you mention it. Not all the time. Mostly when I stand up too quickly. Or if I’ve been out in the sun for too long. A bit wobbly, you know? Like my legs are made of jelly. And I have had to sit down a couple of times, just to be on the safe side. Wouldn’t want to fall off a ladder, would I? That would be a disaster. And my nephew would never let me live it down. Honestly, he thinks he's a doctor himself, always reading things on the internet. A load of nonsense, if you ask me. But yes, dizziness. When I get up too fast, or after too much sun. Is that enough detail for you?
DOCTOR: Okay. Dizziness with postural changes and sun exposure. Let's do a quick physical exam. I'll check your blood pressure, pulse, and just take a look at you generally. Then we can talk about some possibilities. Blood pressure is a little on the lower side, 110/70. Pulse is 88, regular. Lungs sound clear. No edema in your extremities. Skin is warm and slightly dry. Now, have you had any recent illnesses?
PATIENT: Recent illnesses? No, nothing. I'm a fairly healthy man, you know. I’ve always looked after myself. Don't eat a lot of processed rubbish, get plenty of fresh air, keep busy. That sort of thing. No colds, no flu, nothing like that. I had the… the jab, of course, when it was offered. But that was a while ago now. And I haven't been to the hospital for anything serious in… well, I can't even remember. A broken wrist when I was a boy, maybe? But that was decades ago. Really, Doctor, I’m not one for complaining or going to doctors unless absolutely necessary. This heat… this heat is just something different. I’m telling you.
DOCTOR: Alright. No significant medical history, up-to-date on vaccinations, and generally healthy. And you haven’t had any surgeries, have you?
PATIENT: Surgeries? No, never. I wouldn’t trust them with a pair of scissors, let alone a scalpel. My body is my temple, you know. Don’t go poking around in it unnecessarily. No, nothing. Never had an operation. Not even for my teeth. I’ve got all my own teeth, you know. A bit wobbly, maybe, but all there. Honestly, Doctor, I think you’re making a mountain out of a molehill. It’s the heat. It’s just too much heat. Everyone’s feeling it.
DOCTOR: Very well. And family history?
PATIENT: Family history? Oh, goodness. Where to begin? My father… he was a strong man, worked hard all his life. Healthy as an ox, he was. Until… well, until he wasn't. He had a bit of trouble with his heart, towards the end. But he was an old man, you know. Lived a good life. My mother… she suffered from headaches, terrible migraines. But that was all. And my brother… he’s got a bit of arthritis, in his knees. But that’s about it. Not much in the way of serious illness, on either side of the family. We’re a hardy bunch, Nepalese people. We’re built tough. Honestly, Doctor, I keep coming back to the heat. It’s… it’s different this year. More intense. More oppressive. It’s not normal.
DOCTOR: Alright. History of heart trouble in your father, migraines in your mother, arthritis in your brother. Now, do you drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Alcohol? Occasionally. A small glass of whiskey with my nephew on special occasions. Christmas, birthdays, that sort of thing. Nothing heavy. I don't go looking for it, you know. Not a drinker, never have been. A bit of whiskey now and then, to warm the cockles, you might say. But nothing regular. And I certainly don’t drink to excess. I’ve got a good head on my shoulders, I don’t need alcohol to… to loosen it up. Honestly, Doctor, I’m starting to feel like you’re interrogating me. Are we getting anywhere with this? Or are we just going to go through my entire life history?
DOCTOR: Just trying to gather all the information, Mr. Coby. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: Smoke? Good heavens, no! Never touched a cigarette in my life. Disgusting habit. Makes you cough, smells awful, and ruins your health. Absolutely not. I wouldn't dream of it. My father always said, "A clear head and a clear lung are the greatest gifts." And he was right. No, no smoking. Not even when I was a boy. Never had the inclination. Honestly, Doctor, you’re starting to insult me. Are you implying I’m unhealthy? Because I assure you, I’m a very fit man for my age. This heat is making me feel unwell, not some… some bad habit.
DOCTOR: Alright, no alcohol, no smoking. And do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? Not that I know of. I've only taken a couple of things in my life, a painkiller now and then for a headache. Paracetamol, I think it was. And nothing happened. No rashes, no swelling, no difficulty breathing. Just… the headache went away. Never had a bad reaction to anything. Honestly, Doctor, you’re asking a lot of questions. Are you sure this is necessary? I’m telling you, it’s the heat. It’s different this year. More intense. More oppressive. It’s… it’s affecting me. I feel like I’m losing my edge. My concentration is shot. And I need to be sharp. I’m a painter. I need to be precise. This heat is… it’s ruining my work.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Coby. Let me summarize. You're a 62-year-old male, generally healthy, no significant medical history, up-to-date on vaccinations, no allergies, no alcohol or smoking. You’ve been experiencing excessive sweating, dizziness with postural changes and sun exposure, increased thirst, decreased appetite, irritability, and a feeling of fogginess. And you attribute all of this to the recent heatwave. Now, while the heat can exacerbate existing conditions, your symptoms, taken together, warrant further investigation. We need to rule out a few possibilities. I'm concerned about potential dehydration, electrolyte imbalance, and the possibility of something else going on. I'd like to order some blood work. A complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a thyroid-stimulating hormone test. It's a standard procedure. It will give us a clearer picture of what's going on. Does that sound agreeable?
PATIENT: Blood work? Now you’re talking! Finally, some action! Honestly, I’ve been saying all along something isn’t right. The heat isn't making me feel like this, it’s revealing something that’s already wrong! Yes, yes, do the blood work. Get to the bottom of it. I want to know what’s going on. I need to be sharp. I have commissions to fulfill! I can’t be feeling foggy-headed and dizzy. So, yes, please. Do the tests. And hurry up about it, if you don’t mind. I haven’t got all day. Where do I go? And when will I get the results? I’ve got work to do.
DOCTOR: Alright, good. We'll get the lab order processed now. You can go to the lab just down the hall, room 204. Tell them Dr. Pitmon sent you. They’ll take a few vials of blood. It shouldn't take more than 15-20 minutes. The results usually come back within 24-48 hours. My nurse, Sarah, will call you with the results as soon as they're available. In the meantime, I recommend you stay hydrated. Drink plenty of fluids – water is best. Avoid excessive sun exposure. And try to get some rest. I’ll also give you a prescription for an electrolyte replacement drink, just to tide you over while we wait for the results. It's a mild formulation, shouldn’t interfere with anything. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Electrolyte drink… alright. As long as it doesn't taste like those sickly-sweet sports drinks my nephew keeps offering me. Water, I can handle. Sun avoidance… well, I’ll try. It’s a painter’s life, you know. But I’ll be careful. Nurse Sarah, you say? Good. Make sure she calls. I don’t want to be left in the dark. I need to know what’s going on with my body. I have commitments. And I need to be sharp. So, yes. Lab 204, electrolyte drink, and a call from Nurse Sarah. That sounds… acceptable. Now, can I get a copy of the lab order? And is this electrolyte drink covered by Medicare? I don’t want any surprises. Honestly, the paperwork alone is enough to give a man a headache.
DOCTOR: Here's the lab order. And here’s the prescription for the electrolyte replacement. It should be covered by Medicare, but it's always best to check with your pharmacy. They can verify your coverage. I'll also have Sarah print out a summary of our conversation for you, just to have everything in one place. Now, is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: Summary... good. That's thoughtful, actually. Less to try and remember. And yes, thank you. That’s very helpful. Honestly, it's all a bit overwhelming. I'm a painter, not a medical expert. No, I think that's all for now. Lab 204, Sarah's call, and Medicare verification. Just... get to the bottom of it, Doctor. That's all I ask. I need to get back to work. I have a commission deadline looming. And I need to be sharp. Thank you, Doctor Pitmon. I appreciate you finally taking me seriously. Now, if you'll excuse me...
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Coby. We’ll get the results back to you as soon as possible. If anything changes, or if you feel worse, don’t hesitate to call the office. And yes, I understand. Get back to work. Have a good day.
