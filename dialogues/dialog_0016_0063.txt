DOCTOR: Hi Larin, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Maskal. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hi Doctor. Good to meet you too. Um… my back. It’s really bad. Hurts a lot. It’s been hurting for… well, a little while now, but worse this week. I think it’s the cancer acting up again.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Your back is bothering you, and it's been worse this week. You're also concerned it might be related to cancer coming back. That’s definitely something we want to look into properly. Just to be clear, have you been diagnosed with cancer previously, or are you worried about a new cancer diagnosis?
PATIENT: Yes. I had cancer. A few years ago. They did surgery and… everything was good for a while. But now… the pain is like before. It started small, like a normal ache, but it’s getting worse, you know? It’s hard to explain. It's in my lower back, mostly.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s important information. So you had cancer previously, underwent surgery, and were doing well for a while, but the pain is now returning and feels similar to what you experienced before. That makes sense to investigate thoroughly. Could you tell me a little more about the original cancer diagnosis?
PATIENT: It was… in my kidney. The doctor said it was a type that… grows fast. They took the whole kidney out. It was a long time ago, maybe five years? Six? I don't remember the exact name of it… it was a long word. I just remember being really sick and then the surgery. They said it hadn't spread when they took it out, that was good. I had some follow-up appointments, scans and stuff, and everything was clear for a long time.
DOCTOR: Okay, renal cell carcinoma, or kidney cancer, about five or six years ago, with a complete nephrectomy – removal of the kidney. And thankfully, no evidence of spread at that time. You had follow-up scans that were clear for a period. That’s good background information. Now, focusing on this current back pain… can you describe the pain itself?
PATIENT: It's… a deep ache, mostly. Not like a sharp pain, but like something is heavy and pushing. It's in my lower back, right here. It gets worse when I bend over, or when I try to lift something. Even just sitting for too long makes it worse. Sometimes it feels like it goes all the way down my leg a little bit, but not always. It’s just… really uncomfortable. It’s hard to sleep.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a deep ache in your lower back, radiating sometimes down your leg, worsened by bending, lifting, and prolonged sitting. Difficulty sleeping as well. That gives me a clearer picture. Do you notice anything that improves the pain at all?
PATIENT: Hmm… laying down flat helps a little. And when I take those… the pills. The pain pills the doctor gave me before. They don’t make it go away, but they take the edge off. I try not to take too many, though. I don't want to get used to them. And… warm baths sometimes feel good, for a little while. But it always comes back.
DOCTOR: Okay, lying flat, pain medication , and warm baths provide some temporary relief. That’s helpful to know. Let’s talk about your past medical history a little more broadly, just to get a complete picture. Aside from the kidney cancer, do you have any other medical conditions – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, arthritis, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not really. The doctor said my blood pressure was a little high once, but it went down when I started eating better. And… my knees bother me sometimes, a little bit of arthritis, but nothing too bad. I take some vitamins for that. Other than that, I’m pretty healthy. I try to be, anyway. It's just this back… it's really worrying me.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of slightly elevated blood pressure that improved with diet, and some mild knee arthritis. Otherwise, you feel generally healthy. I understand your worry about the back, especially given your history. Now, what about your family?
PATIENT: Um… my mom had arthritis, like me. And my uncle… he had some kind of cancer, I think. Not kidney, though. Something with his lungs. He smoked a lot. Other than that, I don't really know. My family is… far away, and we don't talk much. I don't know much about their health problems.
DOCTOR: Okay, family history of arthritis and lung cancer in an uncle who smoked. That's good to know. Let's talk about your daily life a bit. What do you do for work, and what's a typical day like for you?
PATIENT: I work at the factory. I put the caps on the bottles. It's… not hard work, but I have to stand a lot. A long time. And now with my back… it's really hard. I try to go to work, but I have to take breaks a lot. A typical day… I wake up, have some breakfast, go to work. Come home, make dinner, watch a little TV. Try to go to bed early. It's pretty simple. It's just… harder now with the pain. It takes all the energy out of me.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you work at the factory, doing repetitive work that requires prolonged standing. That certainly could be contributing to the back pain. And it sounds like it’s impacting your energy levels as well. Now, before we do a quick physical exam, let's just cover a few more basics. Do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, no allergies. Never had any problems with any pills or anything. I can take most things. That's good, right? I don't want to worry about being allergic to something if you need to give me something for the pain.
DOCTOR: That's good to know, no known allergies. Okay, Larin, I’m going to do a quick physical exam of your back and legs. I’ll need you to lie down on the exam table, if you don't mind. I'll be palpating your spine and muscles, checking your range of motion, and testing your reflexes and strength. Please let me know immediately if anything is particularly painful. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, okay. That sounds alright. I can lie down. Just… be careful? It hurts a lot. And please tell me what you're doing, so I know what to expect.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Larin. I will explain everything as I go, and I’ll be gentle. Okay, I’m just feeling along your spine and the muscles on either side to check for tenderness. Okay, I’m noticing some muscle spasm here on your right side, and it does feel quite tender to the touch. Now, could you slowly bend forward as far as you comfortably can?
PATIENT: Ooh… that hurts. I can’t go very far. It feels like something is… pulling. It’s really tight.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see. Limited range of motion, and pain with forward bending. Now, let’s try bending backward as far as you can comfortably. And how about bending backward?
PATIENT: That’s… better than bending forward, but it still hurts. Not as much, but… it’s tight. Like something is stuck.
DOCTOR: Okay, so limited range of motion both forward and backward, with discomfort. Now I’m going to test your reflexes in your legs. I’m going to gently tap just below your kneecap with this little hammer. This is perfectly normal. Okay, your reflexes are equal and normal on both sides. Now, I’m going to ask you to try to push your foot against my hand. First, push with your right foot… Good. And now with your left foot?
PATIENT: Okay, I can do that. It's a little hard, but I can push. I feel weak though… I don’t know if that’s just the pain.
DOCTOR: Okay, slightly reduced strength, but present bilaterally. It's possible the pain is contributing to that feeling of weakness. Alright, Larin, thank you for letting me do that exam. Based on what you’ve told me and what I’ve found during the examination – the muscle spasm, tenderness, limited range of motion, and some reported weakness – it seems likely you're experiencing a lumbar strain or sprain. However, given your history of kidney cancer, we need to be very careful to rule out any recurrence or spread. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: A lumbar strain? What’s that? And… what does “recurrence” mean? Is the cancer back? That’s what I’m worried about. I thought… I thought it was gone.
DOCTOR: That's a very reasonable concern, and I understand your worry. A lumbar strain is basically a pulled muscle in your lower back. It's a common injury, often caused by overuse, improper lifting, or simply twisting awkwardly. "Recurrence" means the cancer could have come back, either in the same spot or spread to another part of your body. But I want to be clear: this doesn’t necessarily mean the cancer has returned. The symptoms of a lumbar strain can sometimes mimic symptoms of cancer recurrence, which is why we need to investigate properly. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order some imaging tests – specifically, an X-ray and an MRI of your lower back. The X-ray can help us rule out any obvious bone problems, and the MRI will give us a more detailed look at the soft tissues, including your muscles, nerves, and spinal cord. It will also allow us to check for any signs of cancer recurrence. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Okay… that sounds… good. If it will tell us what’s going on, then yes. I want to know. I just… I don’t want it to be back. How long will it take to get the results? And will it hurt? The MRI?
DOCTOR: I completely understand your anxiety, Larin. It’s good that we’re getting this checked out. The MRI itself shouldn’t hurt at all. You'll lie down on a table that slides into a large machine. It's a bit noisy, but you'll be able to communicate with the technician at all times. They may give you headphones to wear. It typically takes about 30 to 60 minutes. You won't receive any radiation during the MRI. As for the results, it usually takes about 24 to 48 hours for the radiologist to review the images and send a report to me. I’ll then review the report with you as soon as I receive it, and we can discuss the next steps. In the meantime, to help manage your pain, I can prescribe a muscle relaxant and a stronger pain reliever if needed. We can also discuss some physical therapy exercises you can do at home to strengthen your back muscles. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Okay. That sounds… good. I'll take the pills. And I’ll try the exercises. 24 to 48 hours… that feels like a long time, but I guess I have to wait. Thank you, Doctor. I feel a little better knowing we’re doing something.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Larin. I understand it feels like a long wait, but it’s important to get an accurate diagnosis. I'm glad I could provide some reassurance. Before you go, I’m going to give you a prescription for cyclobenzaprine, a muscle relaxant, and oxycodone for pain. Please take them as directed, and be aware of the potential side effects – dizziness, drowsiness, and constipation are common. Do not drive or operate heavy machinery while taking cyclobenzaprine. I'll also print out a handout with some simple physical therapy exercises you can do at home. Start slowly and listen to your body. If anything causes pain, stop immediately. I'll have the receptionist schedule a follow-up appointment for you in about a week, to discuss the MRI results. If your pain worsens significantly before then, or if you develop any new symptoms – such as fever, numbness, or weakness in your legs – please call the office immediately. Do you have any other questions for me before you leave?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s everything. Thank you again, Doctor Maskal. I really appreciate you listening to me. I’ll take the pills and try the exercises. I’ll see you next week.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Larin. I'm glad I could help. Don't hesitate to call if you have any concerns before your follow-up appointment. Get some rest and take care of yourself. We’ll see you next week.
