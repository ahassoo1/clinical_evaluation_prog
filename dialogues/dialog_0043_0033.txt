DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Julie. My name is Dr. Kalinski. It’s a pleasure to meet you. I see you’re here today. Could you tell me what brings you in?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, it’s rather obvious, isn’t it? The receptionist certainly seemed to know. Sudden…difficulties. With my sight and hearing. It’s quite inconvenient, really. I have a very busy schedule.
DOCTOR: Yes, I do see here that you're experiencing some sudden changes in your vision and hearing. I appreciate you clarifying that for me. “Sudden” is important. To help me understand what’s going on, could you tell me a little more about these difficulties?
PATIENT: Honestly, I haven’t the faintest idea when exactly it started. Just…one day things weren’t as clear, and sounds were muffled. It’s all a blur, Doctor. I don’t have time for detailed recollections, you understand. I’m a surgeon. A pediatric surgeon. I deal with precision, not…vague sensations.
DOCTOR: I certainly understand your demanding schedule, Ms. Julie. Precision is vital in your field. Let me see if we have any previous ophthalmological or audiological reports in your electronic health record that might shed some light on this. While I’m doing that, could you describe how your vision has changed?
PATIENT: Really, Doctor? You expect me to describe it? It's…dimmer, I suppose. And blurry around the edges. Like looking through a dirty window. Is that good enough? I haven’t spent my life examining eyes, you know. I fix things, I don’t analyze imperfections. And frankly, it’s quite unsettling. I need to see clearly. It’s rather important when one is operating on children.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s a very helpful description, Ms. Julie. “Dimmer and blurry around the edges” gives me a good starting point. And I understand your concern, especially given your profession. Has this change in vision affected your ability to perform your surgeries at all?
PATIENT: Of course it has! Do you think I would be here if it hadn’t? It’s…difficult. I have to strain to see the instruments, and I’ve had to ask my colleagues to double-check certain things. It’s…humiliating, honestly. I pride myself on my skill and precision. This…this is simply unacceptable. And I haven’t even mentioned the hearing! It’s all quite dreadful.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration and concern, Ms. Julie. It's completely reasonable to feel that way. The fact that it’s impacting your work is significant. Let’s move on to the hearing. You mentioned that’s also been affected. Could you describe what’s changed with your hearing?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s just…muffled. Sounds are distant. Like someone is speaking through a wall. I have to ask people to repeat themselves constantly. It’s…irritating. I attend a great many social functions, you see. One needs to be able to hear properly. It’s terribly embarrassing to constantly ask, “Pardon?” It’s simply…uncouth.
DOCTOR: I see. “Muffled and distant” – that’s helpful. It sounds like we’re dealing with a fairly acute presentation of both vision and hearing changes. With your permission, I’d like to perform a brief physical exam to get a better understanding of what’s going on. I'll start with your vision. Could you please follow my finger as I move it?
PATIENT: Oh, now you want to touch me? Really, Doctor? I assure you, I’m perfectly aware of my own capabilities. But…fine. Get it over with. Just be quick about it. I have a lunch meeting with the hospital board. And please, don’t poke. I have sensitive skin.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Julie. I will be as gentle as possible. We’ll just start with a simple eye chart. Please tell me when you can see the letters on this chart. And no, I won’t poke. <stage>I position the eye chart and begin the test. “Right eye covered. Can you read the bottom line?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, this is ridiculous. They're just…blurs. A jumble of shapes. Is this really necessary? I told you, my vision is poor. It's quite obvious. Can we please move on? I haven't got all day.
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Julie, I understand your frustration. It seems we're confirming a significant reduction in your visual acuity. Now, I’d like to check your peripheral vision. Could you please focus on my nose and tell me when you can see my finger as I bring it into your field of vision from the side?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, this is just…pointless. I can barely see anything as it is. What difference does it make if I can see something out of the corner of my eye? It's all a blur, I tell you! A complete and utter blur. Can we please get this over with? I have important matters to attend to. This is a waste of my time.
DOCTOR: Ms. Julie, I understand your frustration and I apologize for the inconvenience. However, these tests are important to establish a baseline and help determine the potential cause of your symptoms. It’s important to rule out any serious underlying conditions. Now, I’d like to briefly examine your ears. I’ll use an otoscope to look inside your ear canals. This will help me assess your ear drums and look for any signs of infection or blockage. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Fine. But be quick about it. And please, don’t use anything cold. I have very sensitive ears. Honestly, the things I have to endure… It’s simply dreadful. Just get it over with. I trust you know what you're doing. Pediatric surgeons have a reputation to uphold, you know. We don't tolerate incompetence.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Julie. I assure you, I will be as gentle and efficient as possible. Alright. I'm examining your right ear now…the ear canal appears clear. The tympanic membrane, or eardrum, appears slightly…dull in color and doesn't have the typical pearly gray appearance. There is minimal, if any, mobility with my pneumatic otoscope. Now, examining your left ear…similar findings. The ear canal is clear, but the tympanic membrane is also dull in color and has limited mobility. No signs of cerumen impaction or foreign body.
PATIENT: “Dull in color” and “limited mobility”? What does that mean, Doctor? Are you telling me something is wrong? Honestly, I haven't got time for vague medical jargon. Just tell me in plain English. Is it serious? Will I be able to continue my practice? That’s all I care about. And please, don’t waste my time with hypotheticals. I need a straight answer. Now.
DOCTOR: Ms. Julie, what those findings suggest is that there is fluid in your middle ear. The limited mobility of the eardrum indicates that it's not moving freely, which can cause the muffled hearing you've described. It's too early to say definitively what’s causing the fluid buildup, but it could be due to a number of things, including an infection, allergies, or even a blockage in the Eustachian tube. The fact that you're also experiencing changes in your vision makes it important to investigate this further. While it doesn't necessarily mean you won't be able to continue your practice, it is crucial to determine the underlying cause of both issues to ensure the best possible outcome. We need to rule out anything serious. I recommend we get some further testing done, including an audiogram to assess your hearing more precisely and a referral to an ophthalmologist for a comprehensive eye exam. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: An audiogram and an ophthalmologist? More appointments, more tests, more waiting… Honestly, it’s utterly ridiculous. Fine. Do whatever you think is necessary. But I expect prompt results. I haven’t got all day to waste. And I expect you to coordinate everything. I don’t have time to manage appointments and referrals myself. And please, make sure the ophthalmologist is highly recommended. I won't entrust my vision to just anyone. This is my livelihood, you understand. It’s quite important. Now, can we please get this over with? I have a lunch meeting to attend. And tell me, Doctor, is this covered by my insurance? I have very good private insurance.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Julie. I understand your concerns and will coordinate everything for you. I’ll schedule both the audiogram and the ophthalmology appointment. I'll ensure the ophthalmologist is a highly recommended specialist with expertise in your specific concerns. Let me see…yes, it appears both the audiogram and the ophthalmology referral are covered under your insurance plan, with a standard co-pay. I will have my staff contact you with the appointment details and confirm the co-pay amount. In the meantime, I’ll write a referral for both specialists and provide you with a copy. I also recommend avoiding any strenuous activities and protecting your ears from loud noises until we have a better understanding of what’s going on. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No. Just get it done. Quickly. And make sure the appointments are convenient. I have a very busy schedule, you understand. I don’t have time for unnecessary delays. And please, tell your staff to be efficient. I don’t tolerate incompetence. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I really must be going. I have a lunch meeting with the hospital board. It’s quite important. .
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Julie. We will do everything we can to accommodate your schedule and ensure a prompt and efficient experience. My staff will be in touch shortly with the appointment details. Thank you for coming in today. Please don’t hesitate to contact us if you have any questions or concerns. Have a good day, Ms. Julie. And a productive lunch meeting.
