DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Creagh. I’m Dr. Press. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s Marialena Creagh, yes. Well, for the past few weeks, I’ve been having a lot of pressure in my bladder. It’s… uncomfortable, to say the least.
DOCTOR: Pressure, you say?
PATIENT: Yes. It doesn’t exactly hurt, but it feels… full, even when I’ve just gone to the bathroom. And I find myself going quite often, just in case. It’s a little disruptive, honestly.
DOCTOR: Disruptive, hm. And how long exactly has this been going on?
PATIENT: Let me think… it started, I believe, around the middle of July. So, maybe three weeks now? It was gradual at first, just noticing I was going a bit more frequently. Now it’s… pretty consistent, this feeling of pressure. I remember July 15th specifically because that was my anniversary. And I hadn't noticed anything before that day.
DOCTOR: Alright. And is there any pain with urination?
PATIENT: No, thankfully not. No burning or stinging, or anything like that. Just this… constant pressure. It's more of a discomfort than pain, really. And it’s not like a sharp pain, it’s just… there. I’ve also noticed I seem to be going to the bathroom more at night, which is new.
DOCTOR: More at night, you say. And how many times would you estimate you’re going in a 24-hour period now, compared to what you would consider normal for you?
PATIENT: Well, normally, I'd say maybe four or five times a day. Now? It feels like every couple of hours. Perhaps six or seven times during the day, and then two or three times at night. It's hard to give an exact number, but it's definitely a significant increase. It’s been interfering with my sleep a little.
DOCTOR: And have you noticed any changes in your urine itself?
PATIENT: Changes in the urine… hmm. Let me think. No, I don’t believe so. The color seems normal, and I haven’t noticed any blood or anything unusual in it. Just… the usual color, I suppose. And no strange odor either. I’ve been trying to pay attention, now that you mention it.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you had any fever, chills, or lower back pain accompanying this?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, thankfully not. No fever, no chills, and my back has been perfectly fine. No pain at all in my lower back. I’ve been feeling healthy otherwise. Just… this bladder issue. It's just quite frustrating, really.
DOCTOR: Have you had any recent vaginal infections or sexually transmitted infections?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. No, Doctor. Not at all. I've been married for fifteen years, and we've always been very careful. I haven’t had any issues like that in… well, ever, really. I suppose anything is possible, but I'm quite certain I haven't. It’s not something I’ve ever experienced.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications, or do you have any allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I'm not taking any regular medications at all. And thankfully, I don’t have any allergies. No food allergies, no drug allergies, nothing. Just the usual—I get a little sniffly with pollen sometimes, but that's all. I have Medicare, so they keep good track of everything anyway.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, Ms. Creagh, it sounds like you may be experiencing symptoms of an overactive bladder. However, we need to rule out other possibilities first. I'd like to do a quick physical exam, and then I'll order a urine sample to check for infection. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly reasonable. A physical exam and a urine sample. Whatever you think is best to figure out what’s going on. I’m happy to do whatever is needed. I just want to feel normal again, really. And if it is an overactive bladder, what does that even mean? Is it serious?
DOCTOR: It means your bladder muscles are contracting involuntarily. It's not necessarily serious, but it can be disruptive, as you've already noted. First, let’s get through the exam and the urine sample. Could you please follow me to the examination room?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. Lead the way. I’ll follow you. Hopefully, we can get to the bottom of this quickly. I appreciate you taking the time to listen.
DOCTOR: Come along then. We’ll see what we find. And try not to worry unduly, it's likely something fairly straightforward.
