DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Benites. I'm Dr. Murtic. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is nice to meet you. Well, I am here for this...telephone visit, yes? My daughter, she made the appointment for me. I do not always feel so good, and she says I need to talk to a doctor.
DOCTOR: A telephone visit...right. Well, it seems we're doing an in-person visit today, thankfully. It's much easier to get a good understanding of things when I can actually see you. But, alright. You said you don’t always feel so good. Can you be a bit more specific?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, sorry. My mind is not so quick anymore. Specific... hmm. It is like... a tiredness. Not just from working, you understand? I work with cars all day, it is hard work, but this is different. It is inside tiredness. And sometimes... my bones ache. Mostly in my back and my knees. It comes and goes. Is that... specific enough?
DOCTOR: Alright, "inside tiredness" and aches in your back and knees that come and go. That’s a start. How long have you been feeling this "inside tiredness?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That is a difficult question. I think… maybe six months? It started slowly. I thought it was just getting older, you know? But it has not gotten better. Maybe even a little worse, if I am honest. It is hard to say for sure. I do not keep very good track of these things.
DOCTOR: Six months. Okay. And would you say it interferes with your daily activities?
PATIENT: Yes, it does. I have to take more breaks at the shop. My daughter, she worries. She says I push myself too hard. And... sometimes I just do not feel like doing things. Even things I usually enjoy. It is… frustrating. I like to keep busy.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, fatigue impacting your work and leisure. Now, let's talk about other symptoms. Have you noticed any fever, chills, or unexplained weight loss?
PATIENT: Fever? No, not really. I do not think so. I have not taken my temperature in… a long time. Chills… sometimes I feel a little cold, but it is August! It is warm, yes? And weight… maybe a little? I do not weigh myself often. My clothes feel… looser, perhaps. But I am not sure if that is the weight, or just… getting older. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: Alright. We’ll note the possible weight loss. Now, any changes in your appetite?
PATIENT: Changes in… my eating? Hmm. I think I eat less, yes. Not much less, but… I do not feel hungry as often. And when I do eat, I do not enjoy it as much. Food just… tastes different. Not bad, exactly, just… not as good. I used to like to cook, but now it feels like a chore sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay. Loss of appetite, and food not tasting as good. Now, have you noticed any problems with your sleep?
PATIENT: Yes. I wake up many times during the night. I try to go to bed early, but then I am just… lying there. Thinking. And then I have to get up to go to the bathroom. It is very frustrating. I used to sleep very well. Now… not so much.
DOCTOR: Frequent night time awakenings. Alright. Any bowel or bladder changes?
PATIENT: Changes? Hmm. Well, I go to the bathroom more often, yes. Especially at night, as I said. And sometimes… it is difficult. Not always, but sometimes I have trouble going. It is… not comfortable. I do not like to talk about these things, but you asked.
DOCTOR: Right, well, it's good you're telling me. We need to cover everything. Any pain anywhere else besides your back and knees?
PATIENT: Hmm. Sometimes, my head… aches. Not a bad headache, just… a dull ache. Especially when I am tired. And my hands… they sometimes feel stiff and sore. From working on the cars, I think. But it is… different now. It lasts longer, even when I am not working. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Okay. Headaches and stiffness in your hands. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, like diabetes, high blood pressure, or arthritis?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. My doctor… back in the Czech Republic… he said I had some problems with my blood pressure. High blood pressure, yes? I took pills for it for many years. But then I moved here, and… I did not see a doctor for a long time. I stopped taking the pills. I did not think it was so bad. And… no, no arthritis. Not that I know of.
DOCTOR: Alright, history of hypertension, previously treated. And you stopped taking medication when you moved. Any surgeries or hospitalizations?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think. Yes, I had my gallbladder out many years ago. In the Czech Republic, again. And… no, no hospitalizations. Just the surgery. It was a long time ago. I do not remember much about it.
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder removal. Now, any major illnesses in your family?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. My mother, she had problems with her heart. She died when she was very old, but it was a long illness. And my father… he had problems with his lungs. He smoked many cigarettes, you see. And… my sister, she had some problems with her bones. I think it was… osteoporosis? Is that right?
DOCTOR: Alright. Family history of heart disease, lung issues, and possible osteoporosis. Now, let's talk about your social history. Do you smoke or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: No, I do not smoke. Never have. My husband… he smoked, but I did not like it. And… I drink a little wine, sometimes. Just with dinner. Not every night. Maybe two glasses? It helps me relax.
DOCTOR: Alright, minimal alcohol use. And finally, are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, not really. Just a little vitamin D in the winter, because it is so dark here. But that is all. I do not like to take pills if I do not have to. I prefer to feel natural, you see?
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Benites. Thank you for providing me with all of this information. It seems like you're experiencing a constellation of symptoms – fatigue, aches, sleep disturbances, appetite changes – and a history of hypertension, along with some relevant family history. Now, I would like to perform a physical examination to get a better understanding of what’s going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that is fine. A physical examination… yes, I think that is a good idea. Anything to find out what is wrong. Please, go ahead.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you could just go ahead and get comfortable up there, that would be great. We'll start with your vital signs – blood pressure, pulse, temperature, and respiration. Then I'll listen to your heart and lungs, and check your abdomen, and do a quick neurological exam. Just a standard check-up, nothing to worry about. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, 148/92. Pulse is 78 and regular. Temperature is 98.6, and your respiration is 16. Heart sounds are normal, though a slightly fast rate. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, with normal bowel sounds. Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally, and strength is 5/5 in all extremities. No gross neurological deficits noted. Alright, Ms. Benites. Everything seems relatively normal on the initial exam, but your elevated blood pressure is concerning, and the combination of your symptoms warrants further investigation. I want to order some blood work. A complete blood count, comprehensive metabolic panel, thyroid stimulating hormone, Vitamin D level, and a sedimentation rate. We also need to do a urinalysis. Would you be comfortable providing a urine sample?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Blood work and… a urine sample? Yes, I can do that. If you think it will help, I will do it. My daughter always tells me to listen to the doctor. So, what do I need to do? And when will I get the results? I hope it is not too long.
DOCTOR: Good. Excellent. I'll have the nurse come in and provide you with the necessary containers and instructions for the urine sample. For the blood work, I’ll write you a requisition form and you can go to the lab at [Name of local lab, if available, otherwise say "the hospital lab"]. They'll need to draw a few vials of blood. As for the results, it usually takes about 3-5 business days to come back. Once I have them, I’ll give you a call to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and formulate a plan. In the meantime, I recommend you try to manage your stress levels and maintain a healthy diet. Avoid excessive salt intake, as that can worsen your blood pressure. And ensure you're getting adequate sleep. I'm also going to start you on a low dose of Lisinopril to help control your blood pressure, pending the results of the blood work. It's a commonly prescribed medication with minimal side effects, but please let me know if you experience any dizziness or persistent cough. Here's the prescription and the lab form. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: Lisinopril… that is for the blood pressure, you said? Dizziness… and a cough? I hope I do not get either of those. I do not like taking pills, but I understand you think it is best. Is it okay if my daughter comes with me to the follow-up appointment? She is very good at remembering things. And… she asks good questions.
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely. Lisinopril is an ACE inhibitor, commonly used to treat high blood pressure. The dizziness and cough are potential side effects, but they don’t occur in everyone. If you do experience them, please contact the office immediately. And, of course, your daughter is more than welcome to accompany you to the follow-up appointment. Having someone there for support and to help remember things is always a good idea. Based on your symptoms and initial examination, I suspect we’re dealing with either poorly controlled hypertension or potentially early-stage osteoarthritis, though we need the blood work to rule out other possibilities. The blood work will help us assess your kidney function, thyroid levels, and look for any signs of inflammation. Until we have the results, try to take it easy, monitor your blood pressure at home if possible, and let me know if anything changes or worsens. Do you have any other questions or concerns before we finish?
PATIENT: No, I think that is everything for now. Osteo…arthritis? Is that the bones hurting? I hope it is not that. It sounds… painful. I will try to take it easy, and I will ask my daughter to check my blood pressure. Thank you, Doctor. You have been very helpful. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me.
DOCTOR: Osteoarthritis is a degenerative joint disease, essentially wear and tear on the cartilage in your joints. It can be painful, but there are many treatments available to manage the symptoms. We'll get a clearer picture once we have the blood work results. You're very welcome, Ms. Benites. I'm glad I could help. Don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. We'll get to the bottom of this. Have a good day, and take care.
