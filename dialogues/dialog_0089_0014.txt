DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Limtiaco. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Roseburrough. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. It's… paperwork, I think? My wife mentioned something about needing forms filled out. Something about time off, maybe? My memory isn't what it used to be, you see. It’s about work, definitely. Directors, Religious Activities and Education... that's what I do. Or, did do. It's all a bit fuzzy. Is this about being… unable to work?
DOCTOR: Okay, let’s see… Yes, I have a request here from your employer for a functional capacity evaluation and potentially some medical leave paperwork. It seems they need documentation regarding your ability to perform the essential functions of your job as a Director of Religious Activities and Education. So, to clarify, you're wondering if your health is impacting your ability to work?
PATIENT: Impacting…? Well, I wouldn't say it’s a sudden thing. It's more like… things just aren’t as easy. I get tired quicker, you know? And focusing… that’s harder too. Remembering names, dates… that’s a struggle. It’s not like I can’t do things, but it takes more effort, and honestly, I'm not always sure I'm up to it. Is this what the paperwork is for? To figure out if I can still… function? I really don’t understand all the medical stuff.
DOCTOR: Yes, exactly. The paperwork is to help determine how these difficulties are affecting your ability to do your job, and what, if any, accommodations might be helpful. Let's break it down a bit. You mentioned fatigue and difficulty with focus and memory. When did you first start noticing these symptoms?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness… that’s a tricky one. It didn't happen overnight, that’s for sure. I suppose… maybe six months ago? Or was it a year? It’s hard to pinpoint. My wife, Leilani, she’s probably better at remembering dates. She started noticing it before I did, I think. I just… brushed it off at first. Old age, you know? But it’s been getting… more noticeable lately. I'm sorry, I'm not very good at this. I feel like I’m rambling.
DOCTOR: You're not rambling at all, Mr. Limtiaco. It's perfectly normal to have trouble pinpointing when symptoms started, especially when they come on gradually. And it’s very helpful that your wife noticed as well. So, about six months to a year ago, you and Leilani began to notice increasing fatigue, difficulty with focus, and memory issues. Has anything specific made these symptoms worse?
PATIENT: Hmm… specific… I think… stress, maybe? When there are a lot of events at the church, lots of people to meet, lots of planning… it definitely makes it harder. And sometimes, if I don’t get enough sleep… oh, that makes everything worse. It's like my brain just… shuts down. I don’t know if that makes sense. It's not always a bad day, but those kinds of days… they really take it out of me. And Leilani says I'm more irritable when I'm tired. Poor woman.
DOCTOR: Okay, stress and lack of sleep seem to be significant triggers. And increased irritability noted. Now, aside from the fatigue, focus, and memory, are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms…? Let me see… Sometimes, I feel a little… off-balance, like I might stumble. Not often, but it’s happened a few times. And my hands… they sometimes tremble a little. Not enough to stop me from doing things, but noticeable. Leilani said she noticed it when I was gardening last week. She's very observant, that woman. Is that important? I just thought it was old age again.
DOCTOR: Okay, intermittent dizziness and tremors in your hands. Thank you for sharing that. Now, have you noticed any changes in your vision, hearing, or sense of taste or smell?
PATIENT: Vision… hmm. Not really. I wear glasses, you know, but my prescription hasn't changed recently. I went to the optometrist six months ago and everything was fine. Hearing… I sometimes have trouble hearing in noisy places, but that's been happening for years. Old age, I think. Taste and smell… no, I haven't noticed anything different there. Food tastes like food, you know? I still enjoy a good meal. Sorry, I’m probably not being very helpful. Everything’s just… a little hazy.
DOCTOR: You're being very helpful, Mr. Limtiaco. It’s good to know your vision and hearing haven't changed significantly. Let’s move on to your medical history. Do you have any current medical conditions, like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… I had my blood pressure checked a few years ago, and the doctor said it was a little high, but he didn’t prescribe any medication. He just told me to watch my salt intake. I think I had some cholesterol issues at one point, but I can’t remember exactly what the doctor said. I’ve been generally healthy, you know? Just the usual aches and pains of getting older. I don’t have any… serious conditions, that I know of. My wife handles most of the medical stuff, to be honest. She’s very organized.
DOCTOR: Okay, slightly elevated blood pressure in the past, possible cholesterol issues. Let’s talk about medications. Are you currently taking any prescription medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, let me see… I take a multivitamin every day, that’s about it. And sometimes, when my arthritis flares up, I take some over-the-counter ibuprofen. But that’s not a regular thing. Nothing else, really. Just the multivitamin and the occasional ibuprofen. My wife might have something for me in the medicine cabinet, but I don't really keep track of that stuff. She’s good at remembering those things. She worries about me, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, multivitamin daily, ibuprofen as needed. Now, let's talk about your past medical history. Have you ever been hospitalized or had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Hospitalized… hmm. I think I was hospitalized when I was a child, for a bad case of… something. Chickenpox, maybe? It was a long time ago. Surgeries… I had my appendix taken out when I was young, and I think I had some work done on my knee years ago, but it was a minor thing. Nothing serious. Honestly, I don't remember much about it. It was all a long time ago, you know? I have a terrible memory. My wife would know more about this stuff.
DOCTOR: Okay, childhood hospitalization for possible chickenpox, appendectomy and minor knee surgery in the past. Now, let’s talk about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family, like heart disease, stroke, diabetes, or dementia?
PATIENT: Family history… oh dear. That's a tricky one. My mother, she passed away a few years ago, from… I think it was heart problems. She wasn’t very healthy. My father, he lived to be a very old man, but I don't remember him having any serious illnesses. My sister, she has some… arthritis, I think. And my aunt, she had dementia a few years before she passed away. That’s all I can really remember, honestly. My family isn't very good at keeping track of these things. My wife would probably know more, she’s very organized, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, maternal heart disease, sister with arthritis, aunt with dementia. Now, let’s talk about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh no, never. I’ve never smoked a day in my life. And I don't drink alcohol either. Too hard on the body, you know? I used to enjoy a good glass of fruit juice, but even that doesn’t appeal to me much anymore. And recreational drugs? Heavens no! I’m a church director, you know! I try to live a clean and healthy life. Well, as healthy as an old man can, anyway.
DOCTOR: That's wonderful, Mr. Limtiaco. Very good. One last thing, before we move on to a brief exam. Can you tell me about your usual daily activities and any difficulties you’re experiencing with them?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness… well, I used to be very active. I was involved in a lot of things at the church, lots of meetings, lots of events… These days, I mostly take it easy. I enjoy gardening, when the weather is nice. And I like to read, but it’s harder to concentrate these days. I have trouble keeping up with things, you know? Remembering appointments, keeping track of tasks… it’s all a bit overwhelming. And sometimes, I feel too tired to do anything at all. It’s just… everything feels more difficult than it used to be. I’m sorry, I’m rambling again.
DOCTOR: You're not rambling at all, Mr. Limtiaco. It sounds like these difficulties are impacting your daily life significantly. Okay, let's do a brief physical exam. I just want to check your blood pressure, heart rate, lungs, and a quick neurological assessment. It won't take long. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. Just let me know if it’s going to be… uncomfortable. Old bones, you know. And please, don’t mind if I ask you to repeat things. My memory… well, you know. I’m ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Limtiaco. We'll take things slowly, and I'll explain everything as we go. First, let’s check your blood pressure. Please relax your arm, and I'll put this cuff on. Okay, your blood pressure is 142/88. That's slightly elevated. Now, let's listen to your heart. Heart sounds are regular, but there is a slight murmur. This isn't necessarily concerning, but we’ll note it. Now, let’s listen to your lungs. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes and balance. Please sit forward and I'll have you follow my finger with your eyes. Reflexes are slightly diminished, and there's some mild unsteadiness with balance. Finally, I'm going to quickly check your feet for sensation.
PATIENT: Okay, alright. That’s alright… I’m following. Ooh, that’s a bit ticklish. Oh dear… a little wobbly, aren’t I? Yes, I can feel that… a little numb, maybe? It’s hard to say. I have trouble feeling things in my feet these days. Is everything alright, Doctor? You’re not worried, are you?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Limtiaco. Everything is alright. These findings aren't necessarily cause for alarm, but they do give us some information. Your slightly elevated blood pressure, the murmur, diminished reflexes, mild unsteadiness, and reduced sensation in your feet suggest some potential issues that we need to investigate further. Based on your history and the exam findings, I suspect a few possibilities, including peripheral neuropathy, potentially related to age or underlying medical conditions, and possible early signs of cognitive decline. The murmur requires further evaluation. We need to rule out any vascular problems that could be contributing to your unsteadiness. To get a clearer picture, I would like to order some blood tests, including a complete blood count, electrolytes, thyroid function, vitamin B12 levels, and a glucose check. I also recommend an EKG to evaluate the heart murmur. Finally, I’d like you to see a neurologist for a comprehensive cognitive evaluation. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: Neurologist… cognitive evaluation… that sounds serious, Doctor. Peripheral neuropathy… I don’t even know what that is. Is it… bad? And a heart murmur… is my heart failing? I’m not sure I understand all of this. My wife always handles the medical stuff. I suppose… if you think it’s necessary. Blood tests and an EKG… that’s alright. And a neurologist… I guess. But it sounds like… something is very wrong. I knew I shouldn’t have come to the doctor. I should have just stayed home and had a cup of tea. What about the paperwork, Doctor? The forms for work? Will I be able to go back to work?
DOCTOR: Mr. Limtiaco, let's take one step at a time. It's completely normal to feel overwhelmed when you hear these terms, and it’s good that you’re asking questions. Peripheral neuropathy simply means there’s some nerve damage, which can cause numbness or tingling in your extremities. It’s often manageable with treatment and doesn’t necessarily mean anything serious. The murmur needs to be checked, but many murmurs are harmless. We are not saying something is wrong, we are gathering information to understand what is going on. The tests will help us rule things out and give us a clearer picture. Regarding the paperwork, we can definitely address that. Until we have the test results, I can write a note stating that you are undergoing medical evaluation and that your ability to perform certain job functions may be temporarily limited. We can discuss specific limitations once we have more information. I don't want you to worry unnecessarily. We’re doing this to get you the best possible care. Would you like me to explain the tests in more detail?
PATIENT: That… that makes me feel a little better, Doctor. Limited job functions… that’s alright, I suppose. I haven't been feeling up to much lately anyway. Explain the tests? Yes, please. If you don’t mind. I like to know what’s going on, even if I don’t understand all of it. What exactly will they be doing? And will it hurt? Old bones, you know. Everything hurts these days. And what about my wife, Leilani? Can she come with me to the neurologist? I don’t think I can remember everything you say, and she’s very good at taking notes.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Limtiaco. Let's talk about the tests. The blood tests are very straightforward. We’ll just take a small sample of blood from your arm – it’s a quick pinch, and you won’t feel much discomfort. We're checking for things like vitamin deficiencies, thyroid issues, and blood sugar levels, which can all impact your symptoms. The EKG is also non-invasive. We’ll place some small sticky pads on your chest, arms, and legs to measure the electrical activity of your heart. It’s painless, and it takes just a few minutes. Regarding the neurologist appointment, absolutely, your wife can accompany you. In fact, I encourage it! It’s always helpful to have someone with you to take notes and ask questions. They’ll perform a more detailed neurological exam and likely ask you questions about your memory, thinking, and daily life. I’ll write a note for your employer, outlining the limitations and stating that you're under medical evaluation. We can revisit this note once we have the test results. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… manageable. Small pinch, sticky pads… I can handle that. And Leilani can come with me to the neurologist, that's good. She’s very good at asking questions. I’m still worried, Doctor, but I feel a little better knowing what to expect. So, what happens next? Do I need to schedule appointments? And what about the note for work? Will you give that to me today? I suppose I should tell Leilani. She’s going to be very worried.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Limtiaco. I'm glad you’re feeling a little better. Yes, let's get everything scheduled. I’ll have the nurse give you a lab requisition for the blood tests and a referral to a neurologist. They can schedule the appointment for you directly. The neurologist's office will likely call you to set up a convenient time. I’m typing up the note for your employer right now. Here you go. It states that you’re undergoing medical evaluation and that your work functions may be temporarily limited, pending test results. You’re right to tell Leilani. It's always best to face these things together. Do you have any other questions for me right now?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. That's very helpful. I don't think so… I suppose not. I'll need to talk to Leilani and schedule the appointments. And then… wait for the results. It's always the waiting, isn't it? Well, thank you for everything, Doctor. You've been very kind. I appreciate your patience. I think I’ll be going now. Have a good day.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Limtiaco. It was my pleasure. And you are absolutely right—the waiting is often the hardest part. Please don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before your appointments. I wish you and Leilani all the best, and we’ll talk soon. Have a good day as well.
